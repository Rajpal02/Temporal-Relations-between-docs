<p>When it comes to New York Jets players kneeling during the national anthem, team chairman Christopher Johnson is a standup guy.</p>
<p>Johnson said the team wouldn’t fine any player for protesting, despite a new NFL owner-approved measure that enables teams to do so, according to reports.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s rule change says players must stand for the anthem or stay off the field. If any player kneels, his team would face a league fine. Teams can discipline individual players.</p>
<p>“As I have in the past, I will support our players wherever we land as a team,” Johnson said in a statement, according to the New York Post. “Our focus is not on imposing any Club rules, fines, or restrictions. Instead we will continue to work closely with our players to constructively advance social justice issues that are important to us. I remain extremely proud of how we demonstrated unity last season as well as our players’ commitment to strengthening our communities.”</p>
<p>Johnson elaborated on his pledge not to fine players in an interview with Newsday.</p>
<p> “I do not like imposing any club-specific rules,” he said. “If somebody (on the Jets) takes a knee, that fine will be borne by the organization, by me, not the players.</p>
<p>“I never want to put restrictions on the speech of our players. Do I prefer they stand? Of course. But I understand if they feel the need to protest. There are some big, complicated issues that we’re all struggling with, and our players are on the front lines.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s stance could get interesting in the team’s hierarchy. He has been designated as the acting owner while his brother, team owner Woody Johnson, serves as President Donald Trump’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, CBS Sports pointed out.</p>
<p>Trump, who has repeatedly criticized demonstrating players, applauded the new NFL edict. “You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn’t be playing,” he said.</p>
<p>The NFL Players Association criticized the league for failing to consult the union before the change, and vowed to carefully review the new policy.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday that he is pardoning late heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson, who was arrested in 1912 for driving his white girlfriend across state lines.</p>
<p>Trump indicated last month he was considering pardoning the boxer at the urging of actor Sylvester Stallone, who was present at Thursday’s announcement at the White House. </p>
<p>Johnson, the first black man to earn the title of heavyweight boxing champion of the world, died in 1946 after serving time for violating the Mann Act, which banned traveling with a woman across state lines for an “immoral purpose.”</p>
<p>“Johnson served 10 months in federal prison for what many view as a racially motivated injustice,” Trump said Thursday. “He was treated very rough, very tough.”</p>
<p> The son of former slaves, Johnson gained fame and wealth through his boxing career despite rampant racism and violence against blacks at the time. This marks only the third posthumous pardon in U.S. history. In 2016, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), now-retired Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.), Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.) and Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) wrote a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to pardon Johnson for his “improper and unfair” conviction.   “While it is unfortunate that this unjust conviction was not corrected during the boxer’s lifetime, a posthumous pardon today represents the opportunity to reaffirm Jack Johnson’s substantial contributions to our society and right this historical wrong,” the lawmakers wrote at the time.  </p>
<p> Obama, however, kept to the presidential tradition of almost never granting a posthumous pardon.  Trump disparaged Obama at Thursday’s announcement for not issuing the pardon, but others said issuing clemency for Johnson is merely a symbolic move that falls short of addressing present-day racism in the criminal justice system.  Though Obama granted clemency to nearly 2,000 people under an initiative aimed largely at commuting sentences of nonviolent drug-law offenders, his administration was unable to address the nearly 8,000 additional petitions that remained at the end of his term, Kevin Blackistone, a professor and sports commentator, wrote in The Washington Post last month.  Unlike Johnson, ”[t]hey are of living, breathing people ... with children, spouses, partners and futures that can be regained and realized with a second chance.”  Those remaining petitions, he noted, “were left behind in a file, as is customary historic practice, for the review of the next president.” The previous presidents to issue posthumous pardons were Bill Clinton in 1999 and George W. Bush in 2008. Clinton pardoned Lt. Henry Ossian Flipper, the first black West Point graduate who years later was convicted of conduct unbecoming an officer. Bush pardoned Charlie Winters, who had been convicted of violating the Neutrality Act by helping Israel obtain bomber planes in 1948. The pardon of Johnson was the fourth of Trump’s term. He previously pardoned former Dick Cheney advisor Scooter Libby, former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and a case of Navy sailor whose pardon request was promoted on Fox News. So far, there’s been no indication that any of his pardons have gone through the standard procedure through the Justice Department’s Office of the Pardon Attorney, which evaluates requests for pardons and clemency and makes recommendations to the president.  This story has been updated with details of the previous posthumous pardons. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story indicated President Barack Obama pardoned nearly 2,000 people. In fact, that number reflects the total of both pardons and commutations he granted. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump vocalized his support for the National Football League’s new rule that requires players to stand during the national anthem, telling Fox News that perhaps the players who refuse to abide “shouldn’t be in the country.”</p>
<p>The NFL approved the policy on Wednesday in a push to end kneeling during the anthem, which Colin Kaepernick began in 2016 football season as a silent protest in the face of rising racial violence and police brutality. The players not on board will have to stay in the locker room. </p>
<p>Trump praised the league for the new rule that would stop national anthem protests before they happen, saying NFL owners did the right thing. </p>
<p>“I don’t think people should be staying in locker rooms,” Trump told Fox News. “You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn’t be playing. You shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country.”</p>
<p>Trump has derided players and team owners for the kneeling protests on multiple occasions, sparking a debate as to whether the protests were disrespectful of the U.S. military or an expression of First Amendment rights. </p>
<p> NFL commissioner Roger Goodell addressed the controversy in a statement after the new rule was announced that “on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic.” </p>
<p>At an Alabama rally in September, Trump called players who kneeled a “son of a bitch” and encouraged fans to boycott games when the protests occurred. The president has continued to bring up the issue and alluded to it while welcoming NASCAR Champion Martin Truex Jr. to the White House on Monday.</p>
<p>“And I will tell you one thing I know about NASCAR: They do indeed, Brian, stand for the playing of the national anthem, right?” Trump said on Monday. “They do indeed.”</p>
<p>Others from the Trump administration have praised the NFL’s rule change on Wednesday, including Vice President Mike Pence and the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr.</p>
<p>Pence, who left an Indianapolis Colts game after players kneeled last year, posted a screenshot of the news and captioned it ”#winning” on Twitter. Trump Jr. posted a similar tweet on Wednesday captioning an AP article with “STILL NOT SICK OF #WINNING!!!!” </p>
<p>Despite the Trump administration’s celebrations on Twitter, however, the rule may not be the end of kneeling protests. </p>
<p>The NFL Player’s Association, which has supported the players’ right to protest, issued a release on Wednesday stating it would review the new rule and challenge any aspect inconsistent with its collective bargaining agreement. </p>
<p>“The NFL chose to not consult the union in the development of this ‘policy,’ the statement said. “NFL players have shown their patriotism through their social activism, their community service, in support of our military and law enforcement and yes, through their protests to raise awareness about the issues they care about.” </p>
<p>Other Twitter users have noted that the NFL is made up of predominantly black athletes, who could decide to boycott the ruling together. </p>
<p>“The NFL is about 70% black,” tweeted Dominque Hamilton, a former University of Missouri football player. “If united and didn’t take the field at all, it would upset a lot of people and a lot of executives.”</p>

<p>U.S. soccer legend Brandi Chastain admits there’s something “odd” about a new plaque meant to honor her.</p>
<p>Namely, it looks nothing like the two-time World Cup winner.</p>
<p>But Chastain is being a good sport about the bronze not-so-likeness that the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame dedicated to her on Monday, which some Twitter wags suggested bears more of a resemblance to actors Mickey Rooney or Gary Busey:</p>
<p>“It’s not the most flattering,” Chastain said, somewhat diplomatically, at the presentation, adding it was “nice.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday’s broadcast of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Chastain revealed “something struck me as odd” when she took a close look at the plaque. But it was “not a big deal” and she “didn’t want to make a scene,” she said.</p>
<p>It had been “a good laugh” and provided a “great day of laughter,” Chastain added to host Jimmy Kimmel, who’d likened the portrait to one of a powerlifter ― which she laughingly agreed with.</p>
<p>Check out the interview here:</p>
<p>Following the online mockery, Kevin O’Brien, president of the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame, revealed that the plaque would be replaced. “We’re going to redo it,” he told The Mercury News. “We weren’t happy with the rendering. It was not a great job.”</p>
<p>It’s not the first rendering of a star athlete to go down in internet history, joining the botched sculpture of fellow soccer great Cristiano Ronaldo:</p>

<p>The NFL on Wednesday approved a new policy to intercept national anthem protests before they happen, according to the league.</p>
<p>The measure mandates that players who are on the field must stand for the national anthem but can remain in the locker room if they choose.</p>
<p>Teams could be fined by the league if their players sit or kneel, as many have done in protest of racial injustice and police brutality in recent seasons after NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s initial kneeling protest in 2016 earned nationwide attention.</p>
<p>The fining or punishment of players and other personnel would be dictated by the individual teams.</p>
<p>NFL commissioner Roger Goodell noted in a statement Wednesday that “on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic.”</p>
<p>“This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem,” he said. “Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.”</p>
<p>The NFL Players Association criticized the league for failing to consult with the union on the matter.</p>
<p>“Our union will review the new ‘policy’ and challenge any aspect of it that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement,” the union said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Sports Illustrated reported on a different, apparently scrapped, proposal in which teams could be penalized on the field for players kneeling. In that scenario, the home team would decide whether both teams would come out of the locker room for “The Star-Spangled Banner.” And if the teams do emerge and players kneel, officials could assess a 15-yard penalty, the outlet wrote, citing unnamed sources.</p>
<p>“As always, conversations at league meetings are candid, thoughtful and thorough,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told HuffPost in an email early Wednesday. “The clubs explore every option and idea on any policy, and discuss the merits and drawbacks of each approach. We will continue the conversation this morning.”</p>
<p>The league also debated the issue in previous meetings since former 49ers quarterback Kaepernick sparked national controversy in the 2016 season by taking a knee during the anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. The movement, which grew to include other players and teams, continued in 2017, prompting repeated outrage from President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Kaepernick, who was not signed by an NFL team in 2017 after he became a free agent, and former teammate Eric Reid, who also protested, have filed grievances against the league for allegedly conspiring to keep them off NFL rosters because of the demonstrations.</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for our national anthem.”</p>
<p>You’ll hear some version of this announcement at the start of most sporting events, whether they be professional, college or youth-level. The performance of the national anthem is a well-established part of American athletic competitions. </p>
<p>Yet “The Star-Spangled Banner” typically doesn’t make an appearance at many other public gatherings. We don’t sing or listen to it before concerts, Broadway shows, operas or lectures. So why do we do this for sports? </p>
<p>The answer goes back to America’s pastime: baseball.</p>
<p>First, of course, the national anthem began as a poem written by Francis Scott Key in September 1814, after he witnessed the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Maryland during the War of 1812 (which lasted until early 1815). </p>
<p>During the 19th century, the poem gained popularity as a song set to the tune of another popular song, “To Anacreon in Heaven.” It was performed at events like parades, military ceremonies, Independence Day festivities and, yes, occasionally, sporting events.</p>
<p>The earliest documented performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at a baseball game took place at the Union Baseball and Cricket Grounds in Brooklyn, New York, on May 15, 1862. It was the park’s opening game, and over time, playing the song on the opening day of the baseball season became a more widespread practice.</p>
<p>But singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” before every game did not become commonplace until later. </p>
<p>In 1889, Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy signed an order directing that “The Star-Spangled Banner” be the official song to accompany any raising of the American flag by the Navy. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed an executive order designating it as the country’s national anthem for patriotic occasions. But that status didn’t become truly official until 1931, when Congress passed a measure that President Herbert Hoover signed into law.</p>
<p>Historians typically point to one notable event when tracing the connection between the national anthem and sporting events: Game 1 of the 1918 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs.</p>
<p>It was the final year of World War I, a time when many professional baseball games featured marching drills, live bands and other patriotic elements. Given the strains of wartime, however, Game 1 was not well-attended, and the mood was reportedly somber. </p>
<p>During the seventh-inning stretch, however, the band lifted spectators’ spirits with a powerful performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The New York Times recounted the moment: </p>
<p> As the crowd of 10,274 spectators — the smallest that has witnessed the diamond classic in many years — stood up to take their afternoon yawn, that has been the privilege and custom of baseball fans for many generations, the band broke forth to the strains of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” The yawn was checked and heads were bared as the ball players turned quickly about and faced the music. Jackie Fred Thomas of the U.S. Navy was at attention, as he stood erect, with his eyes set on the flag fluttering at the top of the lofty pole in right field. First the song was taken up by a few, then others joined, and when the final notes came, a great volume of melody rolled across the field. It was at the very end that the onlookers exploded into thunderous applause and rent the air with a cheer that marked the highest point of the day’s enthusiasm. </p>
<p>The performance was so well-received that bands played the song during the subsequent games in the World Series that year. And from then on, “The Star-Spangled Banner” was a regular feature of special baseball occasions like opening day, national holidays and the World Series.</p>
<p>During World War II, playing the national anthem before regular baseball games became the norm, thanks to an upswing in patriotic sentiment and technological developments in sound systems that allowed for the playing of the song without the added expense of hiring a band.</p>
<p>The practice spread to other sports as well. After the war ended in 1945, NFL Commissioner Elmer Layden stated his intention to make “The Star-Spangled Banner” a permanent part of every football game. </p>
<p>“We must not drop it simply because the war is over. We should never forget what it stands for,” Layden declared. </p>
<p>Not everyone in the sports world agreed, however. In 1954, Baltimore Orioles general manager and World War I veteran Arthur Ehlers decided not to play “The Star-Spangled Banner” before each game and opted to save it for special occasions. He said that frequent repetition “tends to cheapen the song and lessen the thrill of response” and complained about fans not behaving respectfully during the anthem. </p>
<p>Under pressure from the public and the Baltimore City Council, Ehlers eventually changed his mind. </p>
<p>The owner of the Chicago Cubs felt similarly and did not include “The Star-Spangled Banner” as a standard element at home games until the 1960s during the Vietnam War. The Chicago White Sox replaced the anthem with “God Bless America” for a time in the ’60s but then returned to “The Star-Spangled Banner” after fans expressed their preference for it in an official poll. </p>
<p>With its evocations of warfare and patriotism, “The Star-Spangled Banner” has become a seemingly inextricable part of American sports culture ― and even pop culture, thanks to iconic moments like Whitney Houston’s powerful 1991 Super Bowl performance during the Gulf War. </p>
<p>“Sports are a kind of bloodless warfare,” Marc Ferris, author of Star-Spangled Banner: The Unlikely Story of America’s National Anthem, told USA Today last year. “A sort of war without death.”</p>
<p>Over the years, the anthem has certainly played a part in cultural wars. Most recently, quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s decision to protest racial injustice by kneeling during “The Star-Spangled Banner” has been the subject of heated debate. </p>
<p>In 1968, Olympic athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos were thrown out of Olympic Stadium in Mexico City after raising their fists in a Black Power salute as they stood on the medal podium during “The Star-Spangled Banner.” </p>
<p>Beyond political protests, actual musical performances of the anthem have generated controversy. In 1968, singer-songwriter José Feliciano kicked off Game 5 of the World Series with a bluesy version of the song, which drew complaints from fans expecting a more traditional rendition.</p>
<p>In 1990, comedian Roseanne Barr sang the anthem before a Major League Baseball game. She ended her “screechy, off-key” performance by grabbing her crotch and spitting on the ground. President George H.W. Bush called Barr’s rendition “disgraceful.”</p>
<p>And in February of this year, singer Fergie came under fire for her “sexy” performance of the anthem at the NBA All-Star Game.</p>
<p>For a song meant to unite the country, “The Star-Spangled Banner” can also be quite divisive ― which perhaps makes it all the more fitting for sports.</p>

<p>In a move sure to invite both cheers and jeers, the Israeli Premier League soccer club Beitar Jerusalem said Sunday it was adding “Trump” to the team’s name.</p>
<p>Beitar declared in a Facebook post that it was making the move to honor President Donald Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital city and moving the U.S. embassy there.</p>
<p>The embassy was scheduled to open Monday, sparking fierce protests. Previous U.S. administrations have kept the embassy in Tel Aviv in an attempt to keep peace efforts percolating, but Trump’s shift has stirred resentment among Palestinians who hope to establish their own future capital in east Jerusalem.</p>
<p>“The chairmen of the club, the owner Eli Tabib and the executive manager Eli Ohana have decided to add to the club’s title the name of the American President who made history, and from now on will be called Beitar Trump Jerusalem. We have the greatest love for the president, and we will win,” the team’s statement said, per The Jerusalem Post.</p>
<p>“For 70 years, Jerusalem has been awaiting international recognition, until President Donald Trump, in a courageous move, recognized Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel. President Trump has shown courage and true love of the Israeli people and their capital, and these days other countries are following his lead in giving Jerusalem its rightful status.”</p>
<p>The six-time league champion team has been penalized before because some fans have chanted anti-Arab and Muslim slogans during matches, CNN pointed out. Loyalists lit the team’s offices on fire after it signed two Muslim players in 2013.</p>
<p>The name change is not a done deal, according to The Jerusalem Post. Beitar requires approval from the Israel Football Association, and could face legal challenges because “Donald Trump” is a registered trademark in Israel.</p>

<p>UFC champion Amanda Nunes blasted her bloodied opponent’s handlers for telling their fighter to continue, even after she said she was done.</p>
<p>A badly beaten Raquel Pennington can be hard telling handlers in her corner “I’m done” and “I want to be done” after the fourth round of her bantamweight bout against Nunes in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday night. But the handlers appear to disregard her plea to throw in the towel. “No, no, no,” a coach can be heard saying. Then Pennington is told, “We’ll recover later.”</p>
<p>Pennington answered the bell for the fifth round, absorbing a flurry of punches before the referee stopped the match.</p>
<p> Check out the highlights beginning at 1:20 into the clip.</p>
<p>“If she didn’t have the right conditioning to fight, then the coach should have thrown in the towel for sure,” a triumphant Nunes said, per MMA Junkie. “I think my coach wouldn’t let me go through that. It’s sad. Everyone must be saying a lot of bad things about him on social media, but I really think she needs to surround herself with people who want the best for her so she can really evolve for her next fights. Unfortunately, tonight (the cornerman) failed.”</p>
<p>The decision sparked online debate, but Pennington’s fiancee, Tecia Torres, defended the move in an Instagram post.</p>
<p>“Both us and our coaches agree with the decision made to go into the 5th round,” Torres wrote. “We know Raquel more than anyone else and know if we let her give up on herself going into the last round she would have always regretted it. She fought with heart and grit until the end.”</p>
<p>UFC President Dana White did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment.</p>

<p>A Texas woman ponied up just $18 to play the horses and won an astounding $1.23 million when Justify crossed the finish line at the Kentucky Derby on Saturday.</p>
<p>Margaret Reid played a “Pick 5” bet on Derby day, successfully choosing the winners of races 8 through 12 at Churchill Downs. She made the wager more than 1,000 miles away at the Retama Park racetrack near San Antonio in Selma, Texas.</p>
<p>“It was an amazing feeling, yes, that you won a really big ticket — like, a mini-lotto if you will,” Reid, of Austin, told local CBS affiliate KENS-5 TV. “It was a big ticket because there’s a couple of long shots in the middle of it.”</p>
<p>Justify (at 3-1 odds) was Reid’s last pick for the 12th race. Choices in the earlier races were Limousine Liberal (4-1), Maraud (8-1), Funny Duck (40-1) and Yoshida (10-1).</p>
<p>Reid has been playing Pick 5 bets for years, and says she does her homework, studying the horses. “It doesn’t always work out, but sometimes it does,” she smiled.</p>
<p>“It’s extremely rare,” Retama Park spokeswoman Rachel Bagnetto told ABC News. “To bet that little amount of money and win $1.2 million is unheard of.” It’s the biggest win ever at the Texas track.</p>
<p>“The whole bar went nuts,” Retama Park owner Bill Belcher told the San Antonio-Express News. “She was very excited.”</p>
<p>Reid is planning a big vacation — then investments.</p>
<p>Justify’s owners took home $1.24 million in prize money.</p>

<p>The governing body of the United States’ Olympic teams ignored dozens of athletes’ sexual misconduct complaints against two taekwondo champions for years, according to a new lawsuit.</p>
<p>The U.S. Olympic Committee, as well as USA Taekwondo, turned a blind eye to decades of alleged sexual abuse by brothers Steven and Jean Lopez, two of the sport’s most high-profile figures, contends a lawsuit filed Friday by four named women, as well as 44 women who have yet to be identified.</p>
<p>The lawsuit marks the latest legal battle for the Olympic Committee, which was sued in February over its handling of misconduct claims against Larry Nassar, the disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor who pleaded guilty in November to serial sexual abuse of his patients. Over 265 women have accused Nassar of sexual assault, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman and Simone Biles.</p>
<p>The lawsuit accuses USOC, USA Taekwondo and the Lopez brothers of knowingly participating in human trafficking. The organizations were aware of the numerous sexual abuse complaints since 1996 but continued to allow the brothers to travel and interact with young female athletes, the plaintiffs contend.</p>
<p>“The USOC is deeply focused on supporting, protecting and empowering the athletes we serve,” Patrick Sandusky, chief external affairs officer for the Olympic Committee, told HuffPost in a statement Tuesday.</p>
<p>“We are aggressively exploring and implementing new ways to enhance athlete safety, and prevent and respond to abuse,” Sandusky continued. “The launch of the U.S. Center for SafeSport, along with a number of additional significant actions we are taking, will ensure that our athletes are better protected from these heinous acts.”</p>
<p>USA Taekwondo coach Jean Lopez, 44, was banned from the sport last month following accusations that he sexually assaulted four female taekwondo athletes dating back to 1997. A report from the U.S. Center for SafeSport concluded Lopez had engaged in a “decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct” and allegedly used his authority as a coach to “groom, manipulate, and ultimately, sexually abuse younger female athletes.”</p>
<p>Jean’s younger brother, 39-year-old Steven Lopez, was temporarily suspended from the sport on Monday pending an investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations. Steven Lopez, a two-time Olympic champion, is one of USA Taekwondo’s most decorated athletes.</p>
<p>USA Taekwondo declined to comment on the lawsuit, but confirmed Steven Lopez’s suspension.</p>
<p>“While we cannot comment on a case in process, USA Taekwondo fully supports the important work of the U.S. Center for SafeSport and respects its exclusive jurisdiction over sexual misconduct matters,” a representative for USA Taekwondo told HuffPost in a statement.</p>
<p>“We will resolutely enforce this immediate suspension and any other sanction imposed by the Center,” according to the statement. “We note that this is an important part of providing a safe and nurturing environment for our athletes.

<p>Free Drop Billy. Lone Sailor. Good Magic. Instilled Regard.</p>
<p>If you guessed those were the names of some of the horses competing in this year’s Kentucky Derby, you’d be right. If you also thought that those words seem like they belong in a game of Mad Libs, you wouldn’t be wrong. That’s because officially naming a thoroughbred comes with some interesting limitations.</p>
<p>The names of the Kentucky Derby contenders are often the highlight of the competition. And if you’ve ever wondered how the heck someone came up with a horse name like that, then you’re in luck. We’re here to provide some background.</p>
<p>The Kentucky Derby is reserved for 3-year-old thoroughbreds. The Jockey Club, the breed registry for thoroughbred horses in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, is the organization responsible for approving thoroughbred names. </p>
<p>Although owners can get creative with their selection, it’s common to name a horse after its pedigree, including something involving the name of the horse’s dam (female parent), sire (male parent) or a combination of the names. Some owners also turn to favorite pastimes or words as well as pop culture for inspiration.</p>
<p>Then, there are the rules. </p>
<p>As stated on the Jockey Club site, names aren’t eligible if they are more than 18 letters (the Jockey Club seems to work like Twitter, as spaces and punctuation count as letters) or are made up of only initials or only numbers (if you want to use a number above 30, it has to be spelled out, which might make you max out your character limit). Names also can’t end in “filly,” “colt,” “stud,” “mare,” “stallion” or related terms.</p>
<p>As for jockeys who also might be pop culture junkies, the Jockey Club won’t approve names of living people unless it has written permission. It won’t accept names of those who have died “unless approval is granted by The Jockey Club based upon a satisfactory written explanation submitted to the Registrar.” In addition, names “clearly having commercial, artistic or creative significance” won’t get you anywhere (think movies, songs, etc.). </p>
<p>In a more obvious rule, the Jockey Club will not give the OK for names with “vulgar or obscene meaning” or names that could be offensive “to religious, political or ethnic groups.” In 2007, Slate revealed that some scandalous names (like On Your Knees) had made it to the registry, and Rick Bailey, registrar of the Jockey Club, admitted some “questionable names might have slipped by” because of the high number of submissions. </p>
<p>Did we mention names already in use are out of the picture? The Jockey Club does regularly put out a list of “released” names, though, or names from horses more than 10 years old that haven’t been used for breeding or racing in the last five years. In December 2017, the Jockey Club released 42,659 names.</p>
<p>These are just a handful of the rules. There are more guidelines about referencing racetracks in names and trying to give your horse what the Jockey Club considers a “permanent name,” typically designated for horses who win major races or large financial prizes. If the Jockey Club rejects a name, the most common reason is because it’s already been taken.</p>
<p>The names might not seem to make sense on the surface, but there are fun stories about the Kentucky Derby horses’ names every year. Aside from horses like Magnum Moon and Good Magic that have names associated with their pedigree, there’s also Bolt D’Oro, a nod to Olympic champion Usain Bolt. Audible’s name was inspired by a tactic used in football, according to the Lexington Herald Leader, and the name Free Drop Billy is rooted in the horse owner’s friend taking frequent free drops (penalty-less moves) while playing golf. </p>
<p>You can thank the owners and their creativity for these fun mini histories ― and the several rules they have to follow, of course.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever been to “hands down” the best party ever or had the most delicious meal “hands down,” you’re actually borrowing a phrase from sports terminology, or more specifically, horse racing.</p>
<p>There are theories that the phrase is rooted in boxing or poker. However, dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster traced the origins of the expression to the idea that jockeys, when they had such a great lead in a race, would feel confident and relaxed enough to lower their hands, thus “winning hands down.” And as Mental Floss pointed out in 2015, the Oxford English Dictionary also noted the phrase’s origins in horse racing.</p>
<p>As time passed, “hands down” adopted a more broad meaning that doesn’t necessarily involve a simple victory. We typically use it now to emphasize that something is indisputable and is often associated with a superlative. For example, someone can have the most beautiful singing voice “hands down” or the coolest wardrobe “hands down.” </p>
<p>There are a handful of helpful books that also explain the phrase. Both The Field Guide to Sports Metaphors: A Compendium of Competitive Words and Idioms, published in 2016, and The Language of Horse Racing, published in 2000, give examples of the expression being used in print in the mid-1800s.</p>
<p>So this weekend when you’re watching the Kentucky Derby, you can impress your friends with this fun trivia and prove you’re the most intelligent person like, ever hands down.</p>

<p>Houston Astros relief pitcher Ken Giles got a sock in the jaw for blowing Tuesday’s game ― delivered by his own hand.</p>
<p>Watch the relief pitcher punch himself hard in the face after he was removed from a brutal outing against the New York Yankees in Houston. Giles had given up a three-run home run to the Yankees’ Gary Sanchez that broke open a 0-0 game in the ninth inning. The Astros lost, 4-0.</p>
<p>Here’s the one-man bout:</p>
<p>Another look:</p>
<p>“I just screwed up a win,” Giles told outlets. “We should have won this game. We should have bounced back. I didn’t give our team a chance. Of course I’m going to be frustrated over that.”</p>
<p>But the next time you have a rough night, dude, you might want to avoid going all-Mike Tyson on your own face.</p>

<p>PHILADELPHIA ― Before he was the 2018 Super Bowl MVP and a civic hero, quarterback Nick Foles was a gentle, nurturing kid with white-blond hair and giant hands. That’s how I remember him, at least. Nick and I were childhood friends. His size always made him seem older and more imposing than he was. He was quiet and liked to play Nintendo.</p>
<p>Our families spent holidays together and visited each other between Texas and Louisiana. Nick’s dad, Larry, had been the manager of a Baton Rouge restaurant where my dad bartended in the late ’70s. When Nick was 8, my dad took him and my brother duck hunting in Grand Chenier, Louisiana, and Nick was more interested in caring for the injured ducks in the blind after they’d been shot than in hunting them. At one point he got upset because some of the ducks seemed not quite dead. He wanted to end their suffering. So he tried to shoot one on the floor with his BB gun, but he missed, and the BB ricocheted and nailed my dad in the forehead.</p>
<p>The Nick Foles who greeted me on Monday in a nondescript office at the Eagles’ Philadelphia training facility was not quite the Nick Foles I knew as a kid. I hadn’t seen him in 20 years. He is 6 feet, 6 inches now and in all ways a bona fide phenomenon. Grown colleagues of mine own shirts with his name on them. Men across Philadelphia have his face tattooed on their bodies.</p>
<p>We spoke for an hour about football and fame and faith, about being an apolitical quarterback in a politically charged moment for the NFL, and about his near retirement two years ago and his unusual journey since then, from backup to star to backup again. </p>
<p>Nick! You’re so much bigger than the last time I saw you. I have a picture of you and my brother arm wrestling when you were children. </p>
<p>Eagles PR guy, on his way out of the room: I bet your brother can’t beat him in arm wrestling now.</p>
<p>Nick: Taylor? He and I are getting older now, so we’d probably just have a beer and call it a day. </p>
<p>I thought you didn’t drink. </p>
<p>I’ll drink sometimes, usually hard dry cider. I’ve noticed, even though I’m 29, with all the hits and everything, my body just does not feel good when I drink alcohol. We have so much to do throughout the day, and when I’m healthier and on it, I can get more done and still be a dad and a husband.</p>
<p>Do you have a vice? Do you ever just go nuts and eat a bag of Hot Cheetos? </p>
<p>I had two autograph signings the last two days for like eight hours, and I didn’t eat yesterday, so I got home and I was starving. And we eat gluten free ― my wife got real sick four years ago, so we’ve had to learn, and it helps me too with inflammation. But I got home and crushed a bag of chips. They were the healthiest chips you can get, made with coconut oil and stuff like that, but I’ll definitely have some gluten-free pizza. </p>
<p>So you don’t have a vice. </p>
<p>[Laughs] </p>
<p>What’s it like to suddenly be famous and see grown men around Philadelphia wearing shirts with your name on it and having tattoos of your face on their bodies? </p>
<p>It’s crazy because when I was here the first time around, we broke a lot of records, I got a lot of notoriety for that here. Philly just loves the Eagles. But when I came back after everything that happened in my career in St. Louis and being a backup in [Kansas City], I wasn’t as noticeable. I could go to the grocery store, and people would recognize me, but it wasn’t a big deal. Now I go anywhere in the nation and it’s a big deal. </p>
<p>Tori [his wife] and I were just in Hawaii on a pretty secluded island, and even there the locals knew who I was. A guy recognized me while I was snorkeling — it was crazy. People are always very nice. But I would never sit here and say you just get used to it — I don’t know if anyone’s ever supposed to be used to it. </p>
<p>What’s the weirdest fan encounter you’ve had? </p>
<p>The tattoo things are pretty crazy. I met a guy at a signing the other day — his whole back was me with a trophy on the “Rocky” steps. </p>
<p>Wow. Was it a good tat? What did you say?</p>
<p>I mean, it was his whole back. Forever. There’s not much you can say. I was like, “That’s cool, man.” That’s there forever. </p>
<p>Do you find Eagles fans to be different than fans of other franchises? </p>
<p>Yes. The thing I’ve always admired about Eagles fans is that it’s not fans; it’s family. It’s generational. I was at a signing yesterday and a lady started crying. She said, “I got to watch the game with my 90-year-old mother, and it was the greatest moment of her life, watching the Super Bowl.” Another woman said she was trying to have kids and couldn’t get pregnant, and after the Super Bowl she got pregnant. The doctor said something shifted in her body that allowed her to be pregnant. Stuff like that you hear, and you realize this isn’t just a game for people here. </p>
<p>So there are people in Philadelphia that credit you with their fertility.</p>
<p>This team. Yes. </p>
<p>I saw on Instagram that you have a “Rocky” trophy in your locker.</p>
<p>Yeah, actually the guy who made the real “Rocky” statue [in Philadelphia] sent me that after the Super Bowl. </p>
<p>It’s funny that you saw that on Instagram. I’ve never been great at social media. With what Tori and I want to do, with helping the community and maybe starting a foundation, it’s important to expand that stuff. But I don’t want it to be a highlight reel of me, I want it to be real. My wife gets sick, Lily [his 10-month-old daughter] hit her head the other day — stuff goes on. Though beautiful pictures of beaches are wonderful, I want to post things that inspire me — whether it’s a song or something I read. I’m just trying to home in on using the platform to help people. Because football — though this is awesome, and it’s great to be in the NFL — I knew a long time ago this wasn’t where my heart would be. But now because of this, I can help a lot of people through other avenues. I can go and speak, and people want to see me.</p>
<p>You’ve said that you want to be a youth pastor after the NFL, right? </p>
<p>The media sort of ran with that. People were like, “Oh, you want to be a pastor! God bless you!” When I was in Kansas City and having a tough time in my career, I decided to go to seminary to continue my spiritual growth. And the youth pastor thing — we have a great local church at home, and I always thought it would be cool to volunteer at the church. I could teach some sermons in the high school, but it’s more just to be one-on-one and help those kids at that point in their life. </p>
<p>There are so many people on your team from different backgrounds, different religions, different political views. Do you find yourself being a spiritual leader on the team or more kind of leaving everyone alone? </p>
<p>I think everyone knows I’m a Christian. But I just really want to show love to my teammates and show I genuinely care about them and that I’m not trying to be better than anyone.</p>
<p>When I’m on a team, it’s all about relationships and just getting to know each other. If you ask me about [University of] Arizona, I probably won’t remember a lot of games, but I’ll remember the locker room. I’ll remember working hard with those guys and that friendship. The NFL’s a little different because guys are in and out all the time, but when I step in the building, I just want to get to know people. I’ll go in the equipment room and chat. When you actually love each other and you go into a game, it’s easier to play. When adversity hits, like in the fourth quarter and stuff goes bad, no one freaks out because you’re like, eh, I got it. We all care for each other. We know we can play. Every team says they’re like family, but this team really is more than any other that I’ve seen. That’s why I believe we won the Super Bowl — because of the relationships in the locker room. That’s the coolest part of the game.</p>
<p>The number one thing I tell kids when I go speak is, if you’re doing this for money, fame, girls, boys, cars, whatever, you’re going to be very empty at the end of it. I can tell you that because I’m who you want to be if you want to be an athlete. I’m a professional athlete. And there’s nothing in there. The newest car’s not going to be good enough. For me it’s my relationship with Christ and my family, that’s what it’s all about. </p>
<p>Do you and your teammates joke around and make fun of each other? Do they have any nicknames for you? </p>
<p>Everyone knows I’m sort of goofy. Some guys are really serious when they play. I’m not. In practice, when I’m throwing with receivers, I’ll work on some no-look throws — I’ll look left and throw right. No one will ever do that in a game, but to me it’s just sort of fun, and there might be a day I do do it and everyone’s like, “HOW DID YOU DO THAT?” It’s just off-the-wall stuff. We played ultimate frisbee the other day, and I got to be a kid and run around like crazy. Even in games, I try to keep things humorous. If I throw a really bad ball or a long out-of-bounds ball, I’ll say: “Oh wow, that was really good, Nick. Wow.” But I won’t be down on myself, I’ll sort of laugh.</p>
<p>An example is, during the Super Bowl I threw a touchdown to Corey Clement, our running back, that was between three defenders, and everything happened so fast. But I went through my reads, and I went to throw to Corey and in my head was like, This looks horrible. This is not how we drew it up. I’m not throwing it. What do I do? And all of a sudden the safety slipped a little bit, a tiny bit, and I was like, Oh I got this. And I threw it, but that’s what went through my head in a split second. And it landed between three guys and he caught it. </p>
<p>I have to touch on Colin Kaepernick and The New York Times story about the owners’ meeting, the talk about going to the White House or not going to the White House. There’s obviously a super politically charged environment in the NFL right now. Some of your teammates have been pretty outspoken about politics, but you’ve stayed out of the fray. Do you think it’s possible to remain apolitical as a star quarterback in the NFL? </p>
<p>I just don’t know a lot about politics, it’s something that I just don’t have a great knowledge in, so I just listen and observe. That’s really it. If I spoke about it, I wouldn’t have a lot of knowledge in it. The character of people, the heart of people, that’s where my focus is. When it comes to political issues, I look at things differently. It’s not necessarily for me to speak. I might have opinions, but I like to listen in those situations, because a lot of times you can say something, but you’re not going to be right either way. So it’s pointless.</p>
<p>So you’re staying out of it. </p>
<p>[Laughs] So far. </p>
<p>How do you go from Super Bowl MVP to being a backup again? How do you flip that switch emotionally? </p>
<p>Well, it’s never been done, ever in the NFL, for a Super Bowl MVP to be a backup quarterback. I thought I might have been traded a month ago, because I saw everything in the news, and we’re aware of that because that’s our life. We just moved into a great home here last off season, we have a ten-and-a-half month old, a great place. And if you’re going to be traded, you have to be on your toes. But now that we restructured our deal, and we’re here for at least another year, it’s honestly a great opportunity to impact a lot of people, because a lot of people are gonna look at me and say, “Alright, let’s see how he really responds. Let’s see how he really acts. Let’s see who he really is.”</p>
<p>And pride does seep in, you know. You see a Super Bowl ad and you’re like, wow, that’s crazy! And you’d love the opportunity to start. But you have to reel back in. I think everyone deals with that in some sort of fashion. You know, it’s humbling. I have to humble myself daily to come in here and be a backup quarterback, sit in meetings, and I’m not the starter, though two months ago we were on stage holding the Lombardi Trophy. But it’s good for me. I’m learning a lot about myself and growing in ways I never could imagine. Everyone else looks at it like, “Oh, you should be starting, you should be getting paid this,” and it gets in your head a little bit, and then you have to get it out. Because it doesn’t matter. You really have to just focus on now and just being grateful. It goes back to perspective, like my family — seeing my daughter and my wife. We’re happy. We have great people here. Just sort of enjoying the moment, because eventually football will be over. </p>
<p>What was it like going up against Tom Brady after having been a backup in the same season? How did you not crack under the pressure? Were you nervous? </p>
<p>I didn’t know how my body was going to respond, because it’s such a big stage. You know how you’re going to prepare, but you never know until you step on that field how it’s going to happen. Because you always prepare to succeed, but guys have bad games. My focus was staying in the moment, staying present. It’s easy to look at the big picture and freak out, but we say, “Be where your feet are.” Like right now, I’m present, I’m talking to you. That’s where I am. My mind isn’t wandering. And with that it sort of clears the clutter in your mind. Every day I get up, make coffee, read scripture. I was journaling every day during that time, because there were so many emotions I was dealing with, for leaving the team and being in that situation. </p>
<p>So I felt good going into the game, but I remember sitting there for the national anthem, and I was taking everything in. And I knew the first play of the game was a pass, and on that play I’d sort of get an idea of how my body’s doing, how my heart’s doing, how my mind — like, is everything calm? Then I dropped back, our first read was covered and did a hard reset all the way across the field and threw it to Nelson Agholor for a completion, and I remember right then I thought, I feel really really good. It was probably the most relaxed I’ve ever played in a game, was in the Super Bowl, because I was just very present. The stage didn’t get too big.</p>
<p>And I really believe the reason I was so calm is because I have great teammates and that they’re very talented and work hard and do what they’re supposed to do. Not once this year did the offense get mad when the defense played bad, or the defense get mad when the offense played bad. That showed our team we always had each other’s backs.</p>
<p>Is that different from other teams you’ve been on? </p>
<p>Yeah. I’ve been on teams, I don’t want to name them, but the attention to detail wasn’t great. Schematically, we weren’t great. Great guys, good people, but we didn’t have a strong identity, and going into the games was very stressful, very tough. And I remember having a lot of trouble — like I’ve always thrown for 300-400 yards a game since I was in high school, and it was this one year of my life playing the sport where we could barely get over 150 in a game, where I was used to throwing for that in a quarter. And it was very tough. But there’s a lot of growth that happened that year.</p>
<p>I talk a lot to younger guys, and money can blind them. I mean, when you play, you should get paid for what you do. But make sure you go somewhere with a good system, good coaches. The grass isn’t always greener on the other side. It’s miserable if you get on a team and you aren’t playing well and everyone turns against each other. And I’ve experienced that. I thought I was going to retire two years ago. That was real. That was 100 percent. I was done.</p>
<p>It is because you lost faith in yourself and thought you weren’t good anymore? </p>
<p>I knew I could still play ― they knew I could still play at an extremely high level. I just did not like football. I couldn’t touch a football. Someone would throw me a football, and I would just drop it. I’d had enough, I’d lost the joy. I can’t do something without my heart. I think something inside me was going on, there was so much fear to play again. It wasn’t that I didn’t think I could play, I just had a horrible experience and it just blinded me. But I knew there would be more growth in playing than in stepping away. </p>
<p>And I knew I brought so much joy to my dad and my father-in-law and my family and the people watching, and [the idea of taking that away from them] hurt. They’ll watch me play the game, and it provides so much happiness and escape. My dad has rewatched the Super Bowl probably a hundred times. My father-in-law just watched it again last night.</p>
<p>That’s really sweet! My dad spent years trying to teach me how to throw a football correctly, giving me physics lectures about how my arm is like a whip. Are you going to do that to your daughter? </p>
<p>I’ll probably teach her how to throw a football. I really just want to do everything I can to love her and just be daddy. But I think she’ll have some good athletic genes — my wife is more athletic than me. She played volleyball at Arizona. She’s 5-foot-10, can run, jump. And Lily’s like, top percentile in length. She’ll just get a toy and throw it across the room.</p>

<p>Several cheerleaders for the Washington NFL team revealed to The New York Times on Wednesday that their jobs often take them off the field and into sexually charged situations with men who sponsor the team. </p>
<p>The report adds to the growing pile of evidence that NFL cheerleaders across the league are forced to work under unfair conditions, and, as suggested by the women who spoke to the Times, often beyond the confines of their jobs on the football field.</p>
<p>During a 2013 calendar photo shoot trip to Costa Rica, the cheerleaders said, the team invited a group of all-male sponsors and FedExField suite holders to watch the squad members pose topless or in nothing but body paint for their photos.</p>
<p>After one 14-hour working day on the trip, the cheerleading director told nine of the women that some male sponsors had “picked them to be personal escorts at a nightclub” that night. The director’s request did not appear optional, they said. </p>
<p> “So get back to your room and get ready,” the director told them. Several of them began to cry. “They weren’t putting a gun to our heads, but it was mandatory for us to go,” one of the cheerleaders said. “We weren’t asked, we were told. Other girls were devastated because we knew exactly what she was doing.” </p>
<p>The cheerleaders noted that their escorting duties did not require them to have sex with the men. </p>
<p>Stephanie Jojokian, the squad’s longtime director and choreographer, dismissed the suggestion that the club night was mandatory. The team issued a statement stating that the cheerleaders are “contractually protected to ensure a safe and constructive environment.”</p>
<p>The team confirmed to the Times that the cheerleaders were paid nothing for the weeklong trip, though their transportation costs, meals and lodging were covered.</p>
<p>The cheerleaders also said they felt alarmed when, upon arrival at the resort where the photo shoot was taking place, team officials collected all their passports from them ― a safety precaution, they said. </p>
<p>They also recounted mandatory “bonding” parties that took place on the yacht of longtime team suite holder William R. Teel Jr. with several of his friends. </p>
<p>One of the cheerleaders who spoke to the Times described a similar pressure to participate in the events on the yacht. </p>
<p> One cheerleader a few years later was told what to expect at the annual affair. “I’d been given a heads-up that we were going on this particular man’s yacht and that he had a lot of money — and that you could make a lot of money there if you wanted,” one cheerleader said, referring to the prize money in the dance contests. “But that was not for me, and lots of us felt the same way. But we were too scared to complain. We felt that our place on the team would be compromised if we did.” </p>
<p>Wednesday’s report comes on the heels of several other scandals plaguing the NFL’s cheerleading programs. </p>
<p>In March, a New Orleans Saints cheerleader filed a lawsuit against the NFL citing an unfair double standard over the rules for the team’s female and male employees after she was fired for violating a cheerleader-specific social media policy.</p>
<p>The following month, a Miami Dolphins cheerleader filed a suit against the league after she said she became “a target of discipline, ridicule, harassment and abuse” from the team’s cheerleading director after she posted a photo on social media of her recent baptism.</p>
<p>UPDATE: May 3 ― Team president Bruce Allen released a statement Thursday saying the organization is “looking into the situation” and that several current and former cheerleaders have given “very different first-hand accounts that directly contradict” the Times’ report. </p>

<p>Brazilian Rodrigo Koxa has broken a world record by riding the biggest wave ever surfed, according to the World Surf League.</p>
<p>Koxa mastered the monster 80-footer off the coast of Nazaré, Portugal, in November. His record-breaking feat only became official Saturday, when it was recognized with the Quiksilver XXL Biggest Wave Award at a World Surf League ceremony in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“The award goes to the surfer who, by any means available, catches the biggest wave of the year,” the league said in a statement. “Not only did Koxa win this year’s honor, but he now holds the Guinness World Record for the biggest wave surfed.”</p>
<p>The previous record was set in 2011 by Garrett McNamara, who rode a 78-foot wave, also at Nazaré, authenticated by the Billabong XXL Global Big Wave Awards judging committee, and confirmed by Guinness. Here’s his ride:</p>
<p>Other surfers — including McNamara — have claimed they broke the 2011 record, but Koxa’s ride is the only one that has been confirmed by the WSL and Guinness records.</p>
<p>“I got a present from God,” Koxa told The Inertia online surf news site after the awards ceremony. “It was the best present I’ve ever had.”</p>
<p>Koxa said he almost was killed in 2014 at Nazaré, where many of the world’s biggest surfing waves are. </p>
<p>“For months later, I had bad dreams, I didn’t travel, I got scared, and my wife helped me psychologically,” he said. “Now, I’m just so happy.”</p>
<p>Among other honors handed out Saturday, the award for Wipeout of the Year went to British surfer Andrew Cotton, who broke his back in a horrific fall at Nazaré. He’s still recovering and plans to return soon to surfing, the WSL statement said.</p>

<p>Shaquem Griffin is the first one-handed player to be picked in the NFL draft. The Seattle Seahawks took the linebacker with the 141st overall pick Saturday.</p>
<p>Griffin lost a hand when he was 4 years old due to a congenital condition known as amniotic band syndrome. A first-team All-American from the University of Central Florida, Griffin hasn’t allowed the loss of his hand to deter him from becoming one of the best football players in the country.</p>
<p>At the NFL scouting combine back in February, Griffin performed 20 repetitions of 225 pounds in the bench press using a prosthetic attachment in place of his amputated hand. The 22-year-old ran the 40-yard dash in 4.38 seconds, the fastest time for a linebacker in over ten years, according to ESPN.</p>
<p>Griffin joins his twin brother Shaquil, a cornerback, who was drafted by the Seahawks in 2017.</p>
<p>“This is not the end of my road ... it’s only just the beginning,” Griffin told ESPN. “And I’m going to keep proving people wrong.”</p>

<p>If members from the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic squads had to pick teams during their Friday visit to the White House, there’s one player some would avoid at all costs: President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Quite a few high-profile athletes who represented the U.S. at the 2018 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games were conspicuously absent from the gathering, pointedly avoiding meeting a president with whom they disagree on plenty of issues.</p>
<p>Among those missing: Lindsey Vonn, Gus Kenworthy and Adam Rippon, three athletes who have previously made their political differences with Trump known.</p>
<p>Rippon, who called out Vice President Mike Pence during the Games for his anti-LGBTQ track record, seized the opportunity Friday to once again highlight this administration’s discriminatory policies:</p>
<p>Instead of attending, Rippon made donations to GLAAD, Planned Parenthood and the American Red Cross, and encouraged his followers to do the same:</p>
<p>Kenworthy knew he’d boycott the event visit since before the games started, telling CNN in February he “would definitely decline” the White House visit.</p>
<p>“When we were at our team processing, where everyone gets fitted for an Olympic ring they said: ‘Hey, you can pick this up at the White House visit,’” Kenworthy said. “And I said, ‘I’m not going to that’ and they were like, ‘Yeah, most of the athletes aren’t’.”</p>
<p>Team USA didn’t immediately respond to a request from HuffPost seeking a tally of the athletes who didn’t attend Friday.</p>
<p>Also missing were Erin Hamlin (Team USA’s Olympic flag-bearer), Chloe Kim, Jessie Diggins and David Wise. Hamlin told USA Today she’d be visiting the Johns Hopkins Children’s Center Friday morning instead of meeting Trump.</p>
<p>And while five Olympians — Stacey Cook, Maddie Phaneuf, Arielle Gold and the aforementioned Diggins and Wise — were on Capitol Hill Wednesday to brief lawmakers on climate change on behalf of a group called Protect Our Winters, not all of them made it over to the White House to meet with Trump later in the week.</p>
<p>Protect Our Winters spokesperson Samantha Killgore told USA Today the athletes had made the Congressional briefing a priority over the White House visit and wouldn’t make it. Photos from the White House event show Gold in attendance, however, so it’s unclear who from the group actually skipped out. </p>
<p>Per USA Today, most of the 2018 U.S. Olympic figure skating team was also absent, though not necessarily for political reasons. Many are on tour with “Stars on Ice” and simply couldn’t fit it into their schedules.</p>

<p>Running phenomenon Caster Semenya of South Africa and some other top females runners will likely have to reduce their body’s natural testosterone levels under new rules to continue to compete in top international races.</p>
<p>The new rules issued Thursday by the International Association of Athletics Federations set strict limits on testosterone levels for women and “intersex” athletes in women’s races. They represent a continuing struggle over how to create fair competition amid increased sensitivity and understanding about what constitutes gender in the “binary” sports establishment. </p>
<p>Just as the rules were announced, a leading IAAF scientist said he predicts a third “intersex” category could be established in the next five to 10 years in international competition.</p>
<p>For now, beginning in November, the blood testosterone level must be 5 nanomoles per liter for a continuous period of at least six months for an athlete to compete in a women’s event under the new IAAF track rules. The new levels, down from 10 nmol/L, will apply to all athletes with a “difference of sexual development” designation and will include only female or “intersex” athletes, not athletes designated as male, who would be barred from women’s competition. The levels will apply to athletes competing in international women’s events from 400 meters to the mile.</p>
<p>The IAAF had defended its decision by saying the typical range among elite female athletes is 0.12 to 1.79 nmol/L, according to NPR.</p>
<p>If athletes the IAAF refers to as “hyperandrogenous women” don’t lower their testosterone to the new levels, they will only be allowed to compete with men or intersex athletes under the new rules, in longer events or in lower profile, non-international races. </p>
<p>The IAAF’s new regulations are an attempt to avoid battles over gender by sticking to the basic math of hormone blood levels, specifically testosterone. High levels of endogenous testosterone can significantly enhance sporting performance. </p>
<p>“The revised rules are not about cheating. They are about leveling the playing field to ensure fair and meaningful competition,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe said in a statement Thursday. </p>
<p>“Like many other sports, we choose to have two classifications for our competition ― men’s events and women’s events. This means we need to be clear about the competition criteria for these two categories. Our evidence and data show that testosterone ... provides significant performance advantages in female athletes.” </p>
<p>The IAAF statement said that the new regulations are “in no way intended as any kind of judgement on or questioning of the sex or the gender identity of any athlete.”</p>
<p>A court suspended testosterone levels set by IAAF in 2011 until the organization could prove high levels of the hormone provided an unfair edge in competition, which the IAAF says it has now done. The levels were criticized at the time as specifically targeted at Semenya, whose victories appeared to be hurt by the lowered levels. Her wins increased again when the new testosterone levels were suspended in 2015.</p>
<p>But Dr. Stephane Bermon, head of IAFF’s health and science department, told The Guardian that the testosterone issue affects many female athletes, not just Semenya. “It is not just the one or two people you hear about in the media,” Berman said. “In elite female athletics the number of intersex athletes is 140 times more than what you might find in the normal female population.”</p>
<p>Bermon, who foresees an intersex competitive category in the future, insisted that restricting competition based on testosterone is fair — and does not penalize a natural gift.</p>
<p>“The reason why we have separate male and female categories is that otherwise females would never win any medals,” Bermon said. “Testosterone is the most important factor in explaining the difference. We are talking about females competing with levels similar to males.”</p>
<p>Semenya, 27, who won Olympic gold in the women’s 800-meter races at London 2012 and Rio 2016, didn’t immediately respond to the announcement of the new regulations, but last year she called IAAF’s study of athletes and testosterone levels “nonsense.” She also had an angry tweet Thursday:</p>
<p>Semenya was ordered to undergo gender testing in 2009, the year she won the 800-meter at the World Championships in Berlin at the age of 18. The results were never publicly released, and she was cleared to compete again the following year. She complained then she had been subjected to “unwarranted and invasive scrutiny of the most intimate and private details of my being” that “infringed on not only my rights as an athlete but also my fundamental and human rights.”</p>
<p>The new IAAF rules could be challenged again in court.</p>

<p>LeBron James delivered another incredible moment on Wednesday night, leading his Cleveland Cavaliers to victory over the Indiana Pacers with a three-point buzzer-beater in the first round of the NBA playoffs. </p>
<p>The shot, launched with just 1.5 seconds left on the clock, broke a tie in Game 5, giving the Cavs a 98-95 win and a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series. </p>
<p>In a huddle just before that shot, James told his teammates exactly what to do.</p>
<p>“Just give me the ball,” he told them. “Give me the ball. They had a foul to give, so I wanted to go quick so they couldn’t give up that foul, because we had no more timeouts. So I was able to turn and get to my spot.” </p>
<p>Moments earlier, he helped save the game in another way with this block: </p>
<p>James finished with 44 points, 10 rebounds and 8 assists in 42 minutes. </p>
<p>The shot was reminiscent of a similar moment nearly a decade ago, when King James sank a three-point buzzer-beater in the 2009 playoffs against the Orlando Magic: </p>
<p>Pacers fans looking for a little consolation can note that the Magic came back to win that series. </p>
<p>Game 6 is on Friday night in Indiana. </p>

<p>Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney says she reported the sexual abuse she says she endured from former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar to her coach, John Geddert, in 2011, but no action was taken. </p>
<p>“I was in the car driving back to the hotel. And I even said out loud that last night Larry was fingering me,” Maroney, 22, told NBC “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie in a Sunday night segment of “Dateline.”</p>
<p>Maroney said she reported the abuse while she and her teammates were at the gymnastics world championships in Tokyo. Geddert and a few of Maroney’s teammates, including gymnast and Nassar abuse survivor Aly Raisman, were in the car the night she spoke up. Maroney, who was 15 at the time, said Geddert didn’t say anything in response, while others in the car “gasped” loudly.</p>
<p>Raisman told “Dateline” that Maroney “basically described in graphic detail what Nassar had done to her the night before.” Two other people in the car that night corroborated Maroney’s story to “Dateline.”</p>
<p>Geddert worked in the gymnastics world for decades before he was suspended by USA Gymnastics in January in light of the allegations against Nassar, with whom the coach was reportedly very close. Geddert quickly resigned after being suspended and is under criminal investigation. </p>
<p>“That was the moment that I shut it down,” Maroney said of Geddert allegedly not responding to her cry for help. “In my head, I was never gonna speak about [Nassar] again. And I was just gonna go along with it.”</p>
<p>Geddert did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.</p>
<p>Watch a clip of the “Dateline” interview below.</p>
<p> Nassar, who also served as a doctor at Michigan State University, has been accused of sexually abusing over 260 young athletes. Over the last year, he pleaded guilty to several counts of sexual assault of minors and possessing child pornography and is serving three concurrent prison sentences of up to 175 years.  Maroney said she decided to speak up during the car ride in Toyko because she was “desperate.” The previous night, she said, Nassar’s sexual assault had been worse than ever. “I didn’t feel like it was him anymore,” Maroney said of the incident, which she also detailed when she first went public in an October Twitter post about Nassar’s abuse. “It was this other thing that took over ― the dark part of him. ... He went like overboard that night I was bawling, naked, on a bed, him on top of me. And I thought I was going to die.” </p>
<p> “For the first time, to me, [it] was very, very hard for me to not acknowledge the fact that this was something ― this was not treatment. I was being abused,” Maroney said. “I remember waking up the next day and wanting to tell someone.” Teammates Maroney, Raisman and Jordyn Wieber said they would often return to their hotel rooms during competition and discuss what Nassar was doing to them.  “We would say, you know, maybe he doesn’t realize he’s touching us,” Raisman told Guthrie. “Maybe he doesn’t even know what’s going on. And he’s a doctor. He’s the Olympic doctor.” Maroney had signed a confidentiality settlement with USA Gymnastics in December 2016 barring her from sharing her story. The organization said in January it wouldn’t seek to punish Maroney for breaking the agreement. </p>

<p>Amnesty International on Saturday named former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick its 2018 Ambassador of Conscience for his kneeling protests against racial injustice. </p>
<p>The award, given to Kaepernick in an Amsterdam ceremony, is handed out each year to “individuals and groups who speak out for justice,” Amnesty says on its website, with an aim to “create debate, encourage public action and raise awareness of human rights issues.” Past recipients include Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai and U2. </p>
<p>Kaepernick famously caused a stir by taking a knee during the national anthem at NFL games to protest racial inequality, and by refusing to stop. Other players later joined his protests.</p>
<p>No team has picked him up after he became a free agent after the 2016 season ― although an Adidas executive recently said the company is interested in sponsoring Kaepernick if he is signed. A large number of NFL managers reportedly “generally hate” Kaepernick for his activism, and he publicly earned the scorn of President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Kaepernick operates a charity, the Colin Kaepernick Foundation, which marked a milestone in January when it finished donating $1 million to organizations that help underprivileged communities ― a pledge he made in 2016. </p>
<p>“The Ambassador of Conscience award celebrates the spirit of activism and exceptional courage, as embodied by Colin Kaepernick. He is an athlete who is now widely recognized for his activism because of his refusal to ignore or accept racial discrimination,” Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement.</p>
<p>In a speech at the award ceremony, Kaepernick touched on the death of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old shot by police in Ohio, along with what motivates him and other social activists.</p>
<p>“We protest because we love ourselves and our people,” he said.</p>
<p>He echoed the sentiments in a statement issued by Amnesty: “While taking a knee is a physical display that challenges the merits of who is excluded from the notion of freedom, liberty, and justice for all, the protest is also rooted in a convergence of my moralistic beliefs, and my love for the people.”</p>

<p>(Reuters) - Former cycling champion Lance Armstrong on Thursday agreed to pay $5 million to settle a federal suit claiming he defrauded his sponsor, the U.S. Postal Service, by using performance-enhancing drugs, his attorney and federal officials said.</p>
<p>The settlement ends the long-running false claims suit brought by fellow cyclist Floyd Landis and joined by the U.S. government, which had sought $100 million in damages on behalf of the Post Office, according to statements from Armstrong’s attorney, Elliot Peters, and the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>“No one is above the law,” Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Civil Division Chad Readler said in a statement. “This settlement demonstrates that those who cheat the government will be held accountable.”</p>
<p>By phone, Peters told Reuters that he thinks the Postal Service realized it could not prove damages to it caused by Armstrong’s behavior. He said the settlement was reached ahead of a scheduled May 7 trial date.</p>
<p>Armstrong, who is now 46 and lives in Austin, Texas, won the biggest race in professional cycling, the Tour de France, a record seven times, six of them while riding for the Postal Service team.</p>
<p>He was stripped of his titles and banned for life from the sport in 2012 by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency after it accused him in a report of engineering one of the most sophisticated doping schemes in sports. Armstrong admitted to the cheating in a January 2013 televised interview with Oprah Winfrey.</p>
<p>This is the last legal matter related to Armstrong’s doping, Peters said.</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to devoting myself to the many great things in my life ― my five kids, my wife, my podcast, several exciting writing and film projects, my work as a cancer survivor, and my passion for sports and competition,” Armstrong said in a statement provided by Peters.</p>
<p>The settlement also calls for Armstrong to pay $1.65 million for the court costs of his former teammate Landis, who also used performance-enhancing drugs and who was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France championship.</p>
<p>Landis originally brought the lawsuit in 2010 under a federal law, the False Claims Act, that lets whistle-blowers pursue fraud cases on behalf of the government, and obtain rewards if successful. Landis will receive $1.1 million as his share of the settlement.</p>
<p>The Justice Department joined the case in February 2013 after Amstrong’s public confession.</p>

<p>Martha and Bela Karolyi of the infamous Karolyi Ranch, an elite gymnastics training center that’s sent dozens of athletes to the Olympics, have finally broken their silence about former USA Gymnastics team doctor and convicted child molester Larry Nassar. </p>
<p>The two sat down with NBC “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie for a “Dateline” segment set to air this Sunday. Several gymnasts claimed that Nassar, who’s been accused of sexually abusing over 260 young athletes under the guise of medical treatment, abused them at the Karolyi Ranch in Hunstville, Texas. </p>
<p>“Any child who was violated by Nassar, it’s a crime and it’s so sad,” Martha Karolyi said, adding that it’s simply “awful.”</p>
<p>This is the first time the couple is speaking out since USA Gymnastics cut ties with the training facility in January. The Karolyi Ranch served as USA Gymnastics’ national team training center since 2001, and was the home for many elite American gymnasts including Aly Raisman, Maggie Nichols and Simone Biles. All three gymnasts, and several others, say Nassar sexually abused them at the training center. </p>
<p>“I heard during the testimonies that some of the parents were in the therapy room with their own child and Larry Nassar was performing this, and the parent couldn’t see,” Martha Karolyi said. “How I could see?” </p>
<p>Some parents did testify during Nassar’s sentencing hearings that they were in the room while the now-disgraced doctor abused their child. Nassar would often position himself in between the parent and child while he sexually abused them. Many also pointed to the institutional giants Nassar worked for, including USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University, as the reason many parents blindly trusted him. </p>
<p>Bela Karolyi added his thoughts during the short segment, telling Guthrie: “The whole thing is just like an explosion, a bomb exploding. Boom.” </p>
<p>While it’s still unclear whether the Karolyis knew of Nassar’s abuse, dozens of athletes allege other forms of abuse took place at the ranch including verbal and emotional abuse, and limiting food intake of athletes during arduous training sessions. </p>
<p>National gymnastics champion and Nassar survivor Mattie Larson explained in her January victim impact statement how the isolation of the Karoyli Ranch fostered a culture that enabled a predator like Nassar. </p>
<p>“The complete detachment from the outside world, on top of careless and neglectful adults, made the ranch the perfect environment for abusers and molesters to thrive,” Larson said. </p>
<p>She later called out Martha: “Martha, did you keep Larry around because he was a good doctor? Or did you really keep him around because he let us compete when we were injured and was willing to keep your secrets?” </p>
<p> Larson described the grueling seven-hour practices six days a week that she and her teammates endured at the ranch, saying she spiraled into a deep depression and a “destructive” eating disorder at 15. She dreaded going back so much that she one time deliberately hurt herself to avoid going back to the training facility.  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) opened an investigation in January into the allegations of sexual assault at the Karolyi Ranch.  </p>

<p>Word that Erin Popovich, the wife of San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, had died at age 67 on Wednesday generated heartfelt reactions from the basketball world.</p>
<p>The couple had been married four decades and had two children and two grandchildren, according to the team. She had an extended illness, ESPN reported.</p>
<p>Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant, whose team is playing the Spurs in the playoffs, said, via ESPN: “I just want Pop to know that the whole NBA family is supporting him and got his back through it all. It’s bigger than the game. It’s bigger than winning and losing.”</p>
<p>“I love Pop,” a visibly upset LeBron James said in the clip below. “Such a tragedy. My best wishes go out to Pop and his family. That’s devastating news. The NBA family, we all stick together. I know we compete every night. But something like this happens, it puts everything in perspective.”</p>

<p>The first time USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar examined Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney, she said, he sexually abused her. </p>
<p>Maroney, in her first interview since she went public with allegations against Nassar in October, said he abused her “every time” she saw him after that initial experience ― “hundreds” of times.</p>
<p>“He said that nobody would understand this and the sacrifice that it takes to get to the Olympics so ‘You can’t tell people this,’” Maroney told NBC “Today” co-host Savannah Guthrie for a “Dateline” report set to air on Sunday. “He didn’t say it in a way that was like mean or anything like that. I actually was like, ‘That makes sense, I don’t want to tell anybody about this.’ I didn’t believe that they would understand.”</p>
<p>Nassar, who also was Michigan State University team doctor, has been accused of sexually abusing over 260 young athletes under the guise of medical treatment. He’s now serving three concurrent prison sentences of up to 175 years for sexual assault and child pornography.</p>
<p>Maroney told Guthrie that Nassar groomed her by bringing her food ― a show of affection in a sport that consistently starves its athletes. </p>
<p>“I would’ve starved at the Olympics if I didn’t have him bring me food,” Maroney said, adding that Nassar bought her a loaf of bread. “Your coaches are just always watching you and wanting to keep you skinny. There’s just other things about the culture that are also messed up that he used against us.”</p>
<p>Maroney signed a confidentiality settlement with USA Gymnastics in December 2016 barring her from sharing her story. The organization said in January it wouldn’t seek to punish Maroney if she chose to break the agreement. </p>
<p>During a luncheon on Tuesday for the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in New York City, Maroney said it seemed as though all USA Gymnastics “cared about is money and medals.” </p>
<p>“I wasn’t listened to, cared about or believed, and all of those things need to be weeded out of society because that’s where things went wrong,” she said at the event. </p>
<p>Neither Michigan State University nor USA Gymnastics immediately responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment on Maroney’s remarks. </p>
<p>Other Nassar survivors, including Maroney’s Olympic teammate Jordyn Wieber, and Olympic athletes from other sports, testified before a U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday, encouraging lawmakers to help combat sexual abuse in amateur sports. The same day, seven women filed lawsuits against MSU, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee, alleging Nassar abused them. </p>

<p>Two-time Olympian Desiree Linden became the first American woman to win the Boston Marathon in 33 years on Monday when she broke the tape at the finish line with a time of 2 hours, 39 minutes, 54 seconds.</p>
<p>Linden, 34, won with a time more than 14 minutes slower than her previous two races, but course conditions were not conducive to personal- or course-record performances.</p>
<p>Fellow American Sarah Sellers was second, 4:10 behind Linden.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the right words. I’m thrilled,” Linden said on the TV broadcast immediately after the race. “It’s supposed to be hard. ... I was just lucky to get it done.”</p>
<p>Linden finished second in 2011 with a time of 2:22:38.</p>
<p>In the men’s 26.2-mile race, Japanese amateur Yuki Kawauchi won in 2:15:58, his first major marathon victory. Kawauchi is known in the running community but works full time for the government in Japan and is without sponsorship. He is not regularly viewed as an “elite” marathon runner.</p>
<p>Kawauchi, 31, appeared stunned and emotional at the finish line. While he is a seasoned runner with more than 80 marathon finishes in his career, Monday’s time in Boston adds to his record number of 2:20-and-under marathon finishes.</p>
<p>The temperature Monday morning at the start line was announced at 30 degrees and rain fell throughout the race, often heavily, to make for a slower overall pace.</p>
<p>“For me, these are the best conditions possible,” Kawauchi said after the race.</p>
<p>The last Japanese man to win the Boston Marathon was Toshihiko Seko in 1987. Kawauchi is the ninth Japanese male to win Boston.</p>
<p>Kawauchi is dubbed a “Citizen Runner” and holds the world record for the fastest marathon in a full business suit and the top time wearing a panda costume.</p>

<p>Now it’s baseball season. The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox just brawled.</p>
<p>The rival teams squared off in the seventh inning at Boston’s Fenway Park on Wednesday after Yanks batter Tyler Austin charged at Red Sox pitcher Joe Kelly for throwing a ball right into his back.</p>
<p>The scene got pretty chaotic:</p>
<p>Kelly was retaliating for Austin’s apparently late slide into second base earlier in the game that ticked off Red Sox shortstop Brock Holt, the New York Post reported. Austin cut Holt’s calf with his spikes on that slide, according to MassLive. The benches cleared then as well, but mostly yelling ensued. </p>
<p>Once Austin charged Kelly, though, punches flew and there was plenty of wrestling.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to let anyone push myself around,” Austin said of his mound charge, per the New York Daily News. “That’s why I went out there.”</p>
<p>The umps ejected Austin, Kelly, Yanks reliever Tommy Kahnle and Yankees third base coach Phil Nevin in an eventual 10-7 New York victory, ESPN reported.</p>
<p>Next time try to play nice, fellas.</p>

<p>Score one for persistence.</p>
<p>Andre Ingram, a graying 32-year-old with fading hopes from a decade in the minor leagues, made his NBA debut for the Los Angeles Lakers against the Houston Rockets in LA on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He sank his first shot ― a three-pointer ― and kept making them. He hit 4 of his 5 three-point attempts, and was 6 of 8 from the field overall, scoring 19 points. It was the highest total in a first game by a Lakers rookie since 1993.</p>
<p>If you don’t get choked up a tad by the highlights, you need to turn in your human card.</p>
<p>The week began routinely enough with what Ingram thought was an exit interview for the Lakers’ G-league team. Instead, he got a hug from Magic Johnson and word that he was being promoted to the actual Lakers.</p>
<p>Ingram’s wife, Marilee, in Richmond, Virginia, screamed when she got the news over the telephone, the Los Angeles Times reported. Then she and their two daughters flew out to LA to watch the dream come true.</p>
<p>“I just felt some electricity out there,” Ingram told NBA.com. “It was amazing. The crowd, the lights — it was once in a lifetime.”</p>
<p>Ingram played 384 games in the minors on paltry salaries, earning side money as a math tutor, he told TNT. He thanked Marilee for sticking by him.</p>
<p>The Lakers lost, 105-99, but that’s so besides the point. A star was born ― at least for a night ― after he had waited so patiently for his chance.</p>
<p>Ingram’s call to the Lakers is the perfect bookend to the recent story of a 36-year-old accountant thrust into playing goalie for the Chicago Blackhawks in his first NHL game.</p>
<p>Shoutouts from past and present NBA stars marked Ingram’s moment.</p>

<p>Arjan Singh Bhullar, the first Sikh fighter signed by the American mixed martial arts organization Ultimate Fighting Championship, will have another historic milestone to celebrate this week. </p>
<p>The 31-year-old will square off against Adam Wieczorek on Saturday in Glendale, Arizona, and wear a turban ― a Sikh article of faith ― as he makes his way to the ring. He’ll be the first UFC fighter to do so.</p>
<p>Gurwin Singh Ahuja, executive director of the National Sikh Campaign, told HuffPost he hopes Bhullar and his turban, also known as a dastaar, will raise awareness about the Sikh community. </p>
<p>“A majority of Americans do not even know who Sikhs are!” Ahuja told HuffPost. ”I think Bhullar’s appearance will help introduce the broader public to the Sikh community, and I think his career will inform people that Sikhs are fighters and that we fight for equality.” </p>
<p>Bhullar’s upcoming fight is particularly significant as it lands on Vaisahki, a festival that observes the founding of the body of fully initiated Sikhs known as the Khalsa.</p>
<p>Bhullar, who in his UFC debut last September also became the group’s first fighter of Indian descent, hasn’t always been able to showcase his pride in his heritage. He had planned to wear his turban to his initial match, but UFC policies barred that.</p>
<p>A UFC spokesman told HuffPost that Bhullar did not follow the group’s “approval process for a change in apparel. Once UFC was given more time to vet the request, approval was granted. Going forward, he will be allowed to walk to the octagon [ring] with a turban.”</p>
<p>Bhullar told ESPN UK that the September incident “was disappointing and upsetting and frustrating.” He said that UFC officials needed “some educating and getting them on the same page, but I think we’ve done that.”</p>
<p>Bhullar, who has a 7-0 record in his bouts, has said that his identity as an Indian-Canadian Sikh is central to who he is.</p>
<p>His grandfather arrived in Canada from India in 1959 and faced racism because of his beard and turban, the fighter told the video show MMA Hour. Bhullar’s father took up wrestling as a way to protect himself at a time when the turban was not accepted, Vice Sports reported, and also used the sport as a way to connect with his peers.</p>
<p>Bhullar himself represented Canada in wrestling at the 2012 Summer Games in London, before turning to the sport of mixed martial arts. </p>
<p>Considering his family’s past and legacy, he said he has a duty to honor those before him. </p>
<p>“I always try to represent, to be more than just an athlete, more than just your sport, I consider it selfish to be going in there and just fighting… So many people in my community have sacrificed for me to be in the position I’m at,” Bhullar told Global News. </p>
<p>More than 60 percent of Americans knew nothing about Sikh Americans, a 2015 study revealed. The survey also found that when seeing someone wearing a turban, Americans were more likely to assume the individual was Muslim or Middle Eastern rather than Sikh. And according to the poll, more than half of Sikh children faced bullying in schools, with rates even more drastic for those wearing turbans. </p>
<p>“It is frankly commonly associated with terrorism and religious extremism,” Ahuja said of the turban. </p>
<p>Sikhs, though, wear it as a show of commitment to values that include service, compassion, and honesty. Ahuja said that with more visibility and representation, perhaps people will “correctly associate that the person who wears a turban will fight for equality and the rights of all people.”</p>
<p>“We want UFC fans to know that ... for hundreds of years, Sikhs have fought, and many have given their lives, to protect the rights of others—including Hindus, Christians, and Muslims—to practice their own religions,” he said. “Ultimately, our turban represents our commitment to fight for those values.”</p>

<p>Professional hockey teams across North America came together to pay tribute to the victims of Friday’s deadly bus crash in Canada that killed 15 people, including 10 junior hockey players of Saskatchewan’s Humboldt Broncos.</p>
<p>At Saturday night’s match between the Winnipeg Jets and the Chicago Blackhawks in Winnipeg, players wore jerseys with the same team name, “Broncos,” printed on their back as their nameplates.</p>
<p>“In place of individual names, ‘Broncos’ is meant to symbolize the unity and support of our hockey communities coming together as one for the Humboldt Broncos’ family,” the National Hockey League said in a press release.</p>
<p>“Tonight, we’re all Broncos,” the NHL tweeted while sharing a video of the teams’ touching pre-game tribute that included a photo of the young players, aged 16 to 21, on the arena’s jumbotron.</p>
<p>Similar moments were seen before matches in cities including Edmonton, Toronto, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Boston, Philadelphia, Detroit, Nashville and Denver.</p>
<p>“Hockey is family,” the Arizona Coyotes organization tweeted following a moment of silence during the team’s match against the Anaheim Ducks.</p>
<p>The Broncos’ emblem was also seen on players’ helmets, including the Toronto Maple Leafs and Las Vegas’ Golden Knights. </p>
<p>A GoFundMe account created for the Broncos’ players and family members had received more than $3 million in donations as of Sunday.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Kings also announced that they will donate the proceeds from their Saturday night raffle to those affected by the crash. Other teams have vowed similar donations.</p>
<p>The Broncos’ team captain, as well as nine other players, two coaches, a radio play-by-play announcer and a statistician from the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey team, were all killed in the bus crash while heading to a semifinal playoff game.</p>
<p>One of the players killed, 21-year-old Logan Boulet, had been on life support up until Saturday night. His family later shared that his organs would be donated to help at least six different people.</p>
<p>“Logan made it clear previously that he signed his donor card as soon as he turned 21. Even in his eventual passing, he will be a selfless hero,” his family said in a statement obtained by Canada’s Global News.</p>

<p>Sergio García began the Masters tournament on Thursday as the defending champ, but a historically bad hole turned him into a chump.</p>
<p>If any reader has a mind to take up golf, just watch one of the game’s best players crumble out of contention in a hurry.</p>
<p>García, of Spain, came into the 15th hole at one over par while competing at Georgia’s Augusta National Golf Club. In the end, he required 13 strokes for the par-5 hole, tying for the worst score ever on one hole at the tournament, ESPN noted.</p>
<p>He hit the ball into the water five straight times at one point. </p>
<p>“I don’t know what to tell you,” he said afterward. “It’s one of those things. It’s the first time in my career where I make a 13 without missing a shot. Simple as that. I felt like I hit a lot of good shots and unfortunately the ball just didn’t stop. It’s one of those things. It’s just unfortunate, but that’s what it is.”</p>
<p>What a difference a year makes. He carded a 3 on the same hole when he played it in 2017 during his march to the title, Sports Illustrated wrote.</p>
<p>Garcia finished the day with an 81. The current leader heading into Friday’s competition, Jordan Spieth, has a 66.</p>
<p>Outlets likened Garcia’s meltdown to that of Kevin Costner’s “Tin Cup” character Roy McAvoy, who repeatedly hits the ball into the water.</p>
<p>But this was real ... and really painful to watch.</p>

<p>Fighter Conor McGregor didn’t need to be in the octagon to go on a rampage in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday.</p>
<p>The UFC star was charged with assault and criminal mischief after he threw a hand dolly through the window of a bus transporting other fighters, police told HuffPost.</p>
<p>The incident was caught on video:</p>
<p>Two competitors, Michael Chiesa and Ray Borg, suffered facial or eye injuries that will keep them out of Saturday’s pay-per-view event at Barclays Center in the New York City borough, the UFC said. </p>
<p>The organization said it withdrew another competitor from the schedule, McGregor teammate Artem Lobov, because of his alleged participation in the mayhem, forcing the cancelation of the event’s third bout.</p>
<p>A peeved McGregor showed up unexpectedly to a Barclays press event for the matches after the UFC announced it would strip him of his 155-pound title, the New York Post reported. McGregor, who lost to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a much-hyped boxing match in August, hadn’t fought in the UFC since 2016.</p>
<p>Khabib Nurmagomedov and Max Holloway were supposed to fight for McGregor’s title on Saturday but that bout was canceled as well after doctors declared Holloway “unfit to fight.”</p>
<p>McGregor and his entourage reportedly set upon the bus with Nurmagomedov inside.</p>
<p>“Conor went bananas and put a beating on the van that we were in looking for Khabib,” Rick Little, a coach of one of the injured fighters, told MMA Junkie. “A million security guards had to restrain him.”</p>
<p>McGregor surrendered to police late Thursday without incident, an NYPD spokesperson said to HuffPost.</p>
<p>UFC president Dana White said in a video that McGregor and 20 or so men also threw trash cans while the buses were pulling out of the loading docks. He called McGregor’s behavior and that of his entourage “the most disgusting thing that has ever happened in the history of the company.” </p>

<p>With the devastating school shooting in Parkland, Florida, fresh on their minds, New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman and his assistant Shannen Moen acted quickly and may have helped prevent a potential school shooter. </p>
<p>One of Edelman’s Instagram followers sent him a direct message on March 25, according to the team, alerting the football player to a threatening message in the comments section of one of his posts.</p>
<p>“Dude there is a kid in your comment section saying he s [sic] going to shoot up a school, i [sic] think you should alert the authority,” a screenshot of the comment read.</p>
<p>Edelman contacted Moen, who found the comment posted beneath a photo Edelman had shared of himself and former teammate Danny Amendola.</p>
<p>“I’m going to shoot my school up watch the news,” the comment read, according to The New York Times.</p>
<p>Moen contacted authorities, who responded quickly and traced the comment back to a house in Port Huron, Michigan. An article on the Patriots’ website said a 14-year-old boy had confessed to police that he wrote the threat. He was taken to a juvenile detention center and charged with making a false report of a threat of terrorism. Two rifles belonging to the boy’s mother were found in the home.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Times, Edelman thanked the fan who alerted him to the threatening message. He also spoke of how the Parkland school shooting has continued to occupy his thoughts.</p>
<p>Last month, the Patriots loaned the team’s plane out to fly families of the Parkland victims, as well as students injured in the attack, from Florida to Washington, D.C., so they could attend the March For Our Lives protests. Seventeen students and educators were killed in the Feb. 14 mass shooting.</p>

<p>A coach affiliated with USA Water Polo has been arrested and charged in relation to accusations that he molested underage female athletes. </p>
<p>Bahram Hojreh, 42, has been accused of sexually abusing seven of the athletes he coached at the International Water Polo Club in Los Alamitos, California, between September 2014 and January 2018, according to The Associated Press. Four of the seven girls were 15 or younger during the time the abuse allegedly took place. </p>
<p>The alleged abuse happened during one-on-one coaching sessions, according to court documents. </p>
<p>Officials told the AP that Hojreh is accused of digitally penetrating the girls, touching their breasts and genitals, and pressuring them to touch his genitals. Hojreh, who has been involved in the water polo world for over two decades, is facing more than 20 felony and misdemeanor charges including sexual battery, sexual penetration by foreign object of a minor, child annoyance and lewd acts upon a child.</p>
<p>Hojreh’s attorney, Ricardo Nico, said Wednesday during an arraignment in the Orange County Superior Court that Hojreh “adamantly denies” the allegations, the Orange County Register reported. </p>
<p>Christopher Ramsey, the CEO of USA Water Polo, told HuffPost that Hojreh was immediately suspended from his coaching position when the organization learned of the allegations in January. Hojreh’s membership to the organization was also revoked, and he was suspended from the board of directors for the South California chapter of USA Water Polo. </p>
<p>“USA Water Polo has zero tolerance for sexual misconduct,” Ramsey said.</p>
<p>The allegations were initially reported to the U.S. Center for SafeSport in January. Ramsey said USA Water Polo will support the organization in its investigation efforts. </p>
<p>Hojreh was released on a $250,000 bond and is set to appear in court for a pretrial hearing on June 14. </p>
<p>Neither Hojreh nor the International Water Polo Club immediately responded to HuffPost’s request for comment. </p>
<p>Sexual abuse in Olympic and amateur sports has dominated headlines over the last few months. Former USA Gymnastics doctor and Michigan State University trainer Larry Nassar was accused of sexually abusing over 260 athletes under the guise of medical treatment. He received three concurrent sentences of 60 years, 40 to 125 years and 40 to 175 years in prison on child sexual abuse and child pornography charges.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Southern California News Group published an explosive report in February revealing that USA Swimming has covered up hundreds of sexual abuse cases over the years.</p>

<p>USA Taekwondo coach Jean Lopez was banned from the sport on Tuesday night following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. </p>
<p>Lopez, 44, is accused of sexually assaulting four female taekwondo athletes dating back to 1997, according to a report from the U.S. Center for SafeSport obtained by NPR. He had a “decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct” and allegedly used his authority as a coach to “groom, manipulate, and ultimately, sexually abuse younger female athletes,” the report states. </p>
<p>“Given the number of incidents reported over a span of several years and by multiple reporting parties, most of whom have no reasonable motive to fabricate an allegation ― much less multiple, distinct incidents ― of misconduct, the totality of the circumstances clearly shows a recurrent pattern of behavior on the part of Jean,” reads another part of the report, according to USA Today. </p>
<p>Lopez coached the U.S. Olympic taekwondo team between 2004 and 2016, through four Olympic games. Most notably, he coached his younger brother Steven Lopez, 39, the most decorated and best-known American athlete in the sport. Steven Lopez ― who won two Olympic gold medals, a bronze medal and five world championships ― has separately been accused of rape by two women. </p>
<p>HuffPost reached out to both Jean and Steven Lopez for comment but did not immediately hear back from either. Both men have previously denied all allegations against them.</p>
<p>Jean Lopez also trained two other younger siblings, Diana and Mark Lopez, who competed on the Olympic level as well. </p>
<p>The former coach was declared “permanently ineligible” as of April 3, according to SafeSport’s website. Permanently ineligible is defined by SafeSport as “permanently prohibited from participating in any capacity in any activity or competition authorized by, organized by, or under the auspices of the United States Olympic Committee, the national governing bodies recognized by the USOC, and/or a Local Affiliated Organization of a national governing body recognized by the USOC.” </p>
<p>A spokesperson for SafeSport declined to comment further on Lopez’s ineligibility. </p>
<p>Heidi Gilbert, a former taekwondo fighter who trained under Lopez, told NPR that he had sexually assaulted her after she won a gold medal in the Pan American Games in Ecuador in 2002, when she was 19. Gilbert said Lopez drugged and assaulted her again a year later while the two were in Germany for the World Championships. </p>
<p>“I am relieved and excited that he will no longer be able to coach young athletes or manipulate girls in these kinds of settings,” Gilbert told USA Today, adding that she’s still “highly disappointed” that the process took so long to penalize Lopez. </p>
<p>Another elite taekwondo fighter, Mandy Meloon, filed a formal complaint against Lopez with USA Taekwondo in 2006. According to Meloon, Lopez inappropriately touched her in 1997 when she was underage while the two were traveling internationally for a competition.</p>
<p>Meloon was also in a long-term relationship with Steven Lopez and claims that he physically abused and raped her multiple times.</p>
<p>USA Taekwondo opened an investigation into the sexual assault allegations against Jean and Steven Lopez three years ago, but little was done. Both brothers were allowed to participate in the 2016 Rio Olympics. It wasn’t until the two cases were handed over to the U.S. Center for SafeSport in March of last year that action was taken. SafeSport declined to comment on the current status of Steven Lopez’s case, according to NPR.</p>
<p>Steve McNally, the executive director of USA Taekwondo, declined to comment about the allegations against Jean Lopez. He told HuffPost, “Unfortunately we can’t comment beyond what’s been published on our suspension list at this time. As the decision is still subject to appeal it would be inappropriate to comment further until due process is concluded.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Center for SafeSport was created in 2017 to investigate all sexual abuse complaints in amateur Olympic sports organizations. The nonprofit center was launched in response to the Larry Nassar scandal in the gymnastics world and various other systemic issues of sexual abuse in Olympic sports. </p>

<p>American baseball fans are getting their first taste of “Japan’s Babe Ruth.” </p>
<p>Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels hit his first Major League home run on Tuesday night, just two days after winning his first start as a pitcher. </p>
<p>In MLB tradition for a first homer, the 23-year-old rookie was initially given the silent treatment by his teammates when he returned to the dugout after his 397-foot blast.</p>
<p>But it didn’t last: </p>
<p>While Ohtani struggled through spring training, less than a week into the season he’s already living up to the hype as a two-way threat with skills on the mound and at the plate.</p>
<p>In addition to six strikeouts in Sunday’s often-dazzling start against the Oakland A’s, Ohtani’s homer made him 3-for-7 as a hitter as of midway through Tuesday night’s game.</p>

<p>Villanova’s sixth man was its leading man Monday night.</p>
<p>Donte DiVincenzo came off the bench to pour in a game-high 31 points and lead the Wildcats their second NCAA Tournament championship in three seasons, a workmanlike 79-62 beating of Michigan at the Alamodome in San Antonio.</p>
<p>Mikal Bridges added 19 for Villanova, which overcame an early deficit with a late first-half run fueled by DiVincenzo before pulling away in the second half behind more balanced contributions and its underrated defense.</p>
<p>The Wildcats (36-4) became the first team since North Carolina in 2015 to lead the country in scoring and win the national title. The 2009 Tar Heels were the last team to win every tourney game by double digits.</p>
<p>Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman scored 23 points for the Wolverines (33-8) and Moritz Wagner hit for 16, but they didn’t have enough help. Michigan made just 43.6 percent of its field-goal tries and went a paltry 3 of 23 from the 3-point arc.</p>
<p>After Wagner scored the first bucket of the second half, the Wildcats left no doubt about their superiority. They went on a 14-3 run that Bridges capped with a 3-pointer for a 51-33 advantage with 14:36 remaining.</p>
<p>The lead never dipped below 12 for the game’s remainder as Villanova answered every little Wolverines run with a bucket here, a couple of 3-pointers there. DiVincenzo rattled off nine consecutive points in a 2:39 span, giving the Wildcats a 62-44 cushion with 7:57 left.</p>
<p>Michigan rode Wagner and Abdur-Rahkman to an early lead. The senior duo scored the team’s first 16 points ― Wagner had nine ― as the Wolverines opened a 16-11 cushion at the 12:26 mark of the first half when Abdur-Rahkman drove for a layup.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Villanova found during the first 12 minutes that it wasn’t going to solve Michigan’s defense as easily as it did Kansas’ on Saturday night. The Wildcats, who made a Final Four-record 18 3-pointers in routing the Jayhawks, missed eight of their first nine long-distance attempts Monday.</p>
<p>However, Villanova found something that worked. DiVincenzo shot the Wildcats into the lead with an all-out assault, hitting 3-pointers while also driving for buckets. He scored 10 consecutive points for the Wildcats in a 2:55 span late in the half, enabling Villanova to end the half on a 23-7 run that gave them a 37-28 halftime advantage.</p>
<p>The Wildcats’ win follows the Eagles’ Super Bowl triumph, making Philadelphia the first city ever to win the Super Bowl championship and the NCAA championship in the same year, according to TBS.</p>

<p>Mississippi State was up by five with 2:01 to play, but Notre Dame’s Marina Mabrey hit a 3-pointer and Jackie Young knocked down a jumper to tie the score 58-58 and set up Ogunbowale’s heroics.</p>
<p>Jessica Shepard finished with 19 points for Notre Dame (35-3). Ogunbowale had 18, and Mabrey added 10.</p>
<p>Victoria Vivians scored 21 points, and Teaira McCowan capped a record-setting women’s NCAA Tournament with 18 points and 17 rebounds for the Bulldogs (37-2). Mississippi State lost in the national championship game for the second straight season.</p>
<p>McCowan recorded her 29th double-double of the season. The 6-foot-7 junior finished the tournament with a record 109 rebounds in the Bulldogs’ six-game run to the final.</p>
<p>The game featured the last two teams to knock off the Connecticut dynasty. Mississippi State beat UConn in last year’s Final Four but came up short against South Carolina in the championship game. Notre Dame outlasted the Huskies in overtime on Friday, with Ogunbowale hitting the game-winner in the semifinal as well.</p>
<p>Notre Dame averaged 92.4 points in its previous five tournament wins but struggled to establish any rhythm against Mississippi State’s pestering man-to-man defense. The Fighting Irish scored only three points in the second quarter and trailed 30-17 at halftime. The three points in the second quarter were the fewest in a period in Final Four history.</p>
<p>McCowan had a big hand in Notre Dame’s offensive woes. She had nine points, eight rebounds and two authoritative blocks in the first half. During one stretch midway through the second, she hit a jumper on end and then blocked an attempted layup from Mabrey that led to a turnover. Mississippi State forced 12 first-half turnovers.</p>
<p>Notre Dame stormed back in the third quarter. Ogunbowale converted a three-point play with a driving layup and free throw to trim Mississippi State’s lead to 41-38 late in the third quarter. The Irish closed out the quarter with a 16-1 run, tying the score 41-41 on a put-back by Shepard.</p>

<p>Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, said he had “three or four major depression spells” after his medal-winning competitions and “straight wanted to die” after a second DUI arrest.</p>
<p>During a recent episode of David Axelrod’s podcast, “The Axe Files,” Phelps opened up about his depression, and blamed the U.S. Olympic Committee for failing to help athletes transition from the grueling demands of training and competition to the letdown that inevitably follows. </p>
<p>“The USOC, in my opinion, hasn’t done anything to help us transition after an Olympics,” said Phelps, who estimated that roughly 90 percent of athletes experience post-games depression. “I think it’s sad. I think it’s unfortunate. It’s something that we’re working towards now.”</p>
<p>Phelps revealed he had suicidal thoughts after the 2012 London Olympics, where he won several gold medals. He said he was “doing the bare minimum” to compete, and wanted to leave the sport. The feeling came to a head in 2014, he said, when he got his second DUI. </p>
<p>“I wanted to die. I straight wanted to die,” he said. </p>
<p>He said he actually checked his supply of sleeping pills “and I had one Ambien left.”</p>
<p>“And I’m actually happy I only had one,” he added. “That scares the living hell out of me.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Olympic Committee didn’t immediately answer a request for comment.</p>
<p>USOC offers what it calls the pivot program to help “retiring athletes in their health and well-being as whole people beyond athletics by providing tools, techniques and a support system to discover and cultivate their next passions and goals as they transition out of elite competition.” The goal is to facilitate athletes’ transition into the “real world.”</p>
<p>Phelps said he went to rehab in Arizona after his second DUI arrest. He said he hoped the USOC will do more to help other athletes. </p>
<p>Current and former athletes like Olympic swimmer Missy Franklin and NBA star Kevin Love also have publicly discussed their mental health struggles. U.S. senators have called for a probe of the USOC after former USA Gymastics team doctor Larry Nassar’s sexual assault convictions involving young athletes, including Olympians. </p>
<p>“We’re competing to represent our country. We’re competing to do everything we can to try to win a medal or to try to do our country proud by wearing the stars and stripes on international ground,” said Phelps.</p>
<p>“When we come home from it, you know, they’re like, kind of, ‘Okay, check. Who’s the next kid coming in? Where’s the next person?’ And I think it’s sad.”</p>

<p>Amateurism is beaten and bloodied. Still it stands. </p>
<p>Andy Schwarz and Ricky Volante want to deliver the coup de grâce. </p>
<p>Michigan and Villanova are playing tonight for the NCAA’s men’s college basketball championship. A lot of people will make money off this game, and none of them will be anyone who played in it. The NCAA, the television networks, the universities, the coaches and corporate sponsors — they’ll all get some piece of the millions of dollars raked in annually by the tournament. The actual attraction, the players on the court, won’t receive a dime.</p>
<p>Over the last five years, the NCAA “amateurism” model that keeps players from truly sharing in the massive amount of money they create has faced significant challenges. Former UCLA basketball player Ed O’Bannon sued the NCAA in 2009 over the use of college athletes’ names, images and likenesses in video games and won a victory in federal court. Members of Northwestern University’s football squad fought for and won the right to form the first players’ union in college sports history.</p>
<p>But each time, the celebrations that accompanied those victories proved premature: A key provision of the O’Bannon ruling that would’ve lifted the NCAA’s ban on compensation was tossed out on appeal; the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Northwestern’s players couldn’t, in fact, form a union. </p>
<p>In 2017, Schwarz, an economist and frequent critic of the NCAA, and Volante, a lawyer, announced the creation of the Historical Basketball League, an alternative to the NCAA that would pay the players on teams at historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs. </p>
<p>The HBL hasn’t launched yet, but the proposal arrives at an important juncture in the war on the NCAA. Last fall, word came down of an FBI investigation into how major college basketball programs managed to pay their best players, a dubious and destructive exercise in federalizing the NCAA rulebook. The likely immediate outcome will be an entrenchment of the NCAA’s power to police its amateurism ideal, what with the G-Men now working in concert with the governing body’s rent-a-cops.</p>
<p> But other effects likely will be less friendly to the NCAA. For one thing, the possibility of federal criminal charges will surely change the risk calculus for people connected to the bootleg economy of big-time college sports — the assistant coaches, the sneaker company reps, the bagmen. At some point, you figure, they’re going to start looking for alternatives to the current model.</p>
<p>Into this uncertain moment comes the HBL. The proposal is an extension of the argument against the NCAA being heard in the courts and from certain corners of the media. The HBL wants to test the notion, frequently offered by NCAA dead-enders, that people will stop caring about college sports if the athletes are compensated in something other than company scrip. And the league’s focus on black colleges is a reminder that the NCAA’s ruinous attachment to the amateurism ideal creates racist outcomes in which revenue generated by black athletes is redistributed among predominantly white coaches, white administrators, white executives.</p>
<p>But Schwarz and Volante want to do more than just mount an argument; they’re trying to build a real basketball league. Last week, HuffPost sat down with them to talk about their proposal, how it would work and who has expressed interest thus far.</p>
<p>The following is a transcript of the discussion, edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p>HuffPost: What exactly is the HBL?</p>
<p>Schwarz: The HBL, it stands for Historical Basketball League, and the “H” is doing double-duty. One is because we’re going to be partnering with historically black colleges and universities. The other thing is, in the formative years of college sports, there were no NCAA rules against pay, and many of those athletes were paid.</p>
<p>So we’re returning college basketball to the historic roots of college sports played by college students, but by paid college students. We are a professional college sports league. All of our athletes will be full-time students at HBCUs. Our season is in the summer to make sure it minimizes the conflict between athletics and academics. </p>
<p>The idea here is to essentially put on a great college basketball program, played at great colleges with deep history, with three future NBA or European basketball stars on the court playing each other. The only thing that’s going to be different from what people are used to is that the athletes will be sharing. It’ll be like fair trade basketball ― the workers will be getting a fair share of the revenue that we’re generating.</p>
<p>HuffPost: How did the idea come about?</p>
<p>Schwarz: So, the two precipitating events were our success ― and I say our because I worked on the case ― in the O’Bannon case, where a judge found that what the NCAA does when it sets a maximum scholarship is price-fixing, and the success of the unionization effort at Northwestern, where a local administrator acknowledged that the duties of a college football player met the definition of an employee under federal labor law. And then the consequent rollback by appeals courts of both of those decisions. </p>
<p>It felt like years of effort to get real change and succeeding and convincing two finders of fact and law were gone in a heartbeat because of older, less-informed people one step up the chain. It was frustrating. </p>
<p>So, if you can’t unionize and you can’t sue them, the other way to beat a cartel is to out-compete them. And the idea here is that by depressing the salary of college athletes, you create an opportunity for entry. Sort of like how by being a horrible taxi company, you create the ability for Lyft or Uber to start grabbing customers. It’s the same thing here, and what we want to do is effectively force the industry to recognize the value of the talent by paying them more. Either they will compete with us, or they won’t. </p>
<p>Volante: Our mission has three different prongs: First and foremost, to create a sports economy that the athletes actually get to participate in. Number two is empowering these schools that historically have considerable significance, especially in the South. And number three is disrupting the concept of amateurism and proving that the concept of amateurism isn’t necessary for college sports to be successful, and furthermore, that amateurism is not necessary for people to tune in and watch, as the NCAA repeatedly claims. </p>
<p>HuffPost: Is this a real plan with a chance to come to fruition, or is it an effort to say, “This is possible for the NCAA to do”?</p>
<p>Volante: This is definitely a real plan. We already have several investors from Silicon Valley. We have an investor from the New York tech community. They certainly see the value from a monetization standpoint. </p>
<p>For me, this is a full-time job. We have a team. We have at least 30 people across the country that contribute in some way, shape or form. We have Keith Sparks, who is our chief development officer and was formerly an associate athletic director at Stanford University. And he was able to bring us our CMO, Ralph Greene, who used to head Nike Football and also started Nike Basketball’s international pipeline. This is absolutely a real thing.</p>
<p>HuffPost: Why HBCUs? What makes, say, Howard or Grambling the right place to do this?</p>
<p>Schwarz: The schools within the NCAA cartel who are getting the short end of the deal are the HBCUs. A Division I HBCU gets less than a million dollars from the NCAA and its conference combined. A [Southeastern Conference] school can get over $40 million. That’s a huge disparity. So what they are getting for the exploitation of black labor is a small amount. And they are, of the people receiving some of these profits, the ones that most recognize that a system in which black labor was more valued would be mission-consistent with their raison d’etre, in a way that some other small schools might think about but not care about. That’s my theory.</p>
<p>Volante: Beyond the economic piece of it, historically, these universities have been involved in a number of selfless efforts to offer educational opportunities and further the economic opportunities for African Americans as a whole. A lot of these schools started right after the Civil War during the Reconstruction Era, so there’s the opportunity there that taking these brands which are very strong within the HBCU community and the African-American community and breathing new life into them and showing to the rest of the U.S. how great of institutions they truly are, and how well they prepare individuals for life after college, whether they’re an athlete or not.</p>
<p>We think there’s significant upside for the schools to get involved, but also significant upside for these players to go onto campuses where they will be welcomed with open arms and there will be a holistic approach to preparing for life after basketball, or getting all the tools they need to go to the NBA. </p>
<p>HuffPost: Do you worry about the perception of white guys creating a business model that’s, for lack of a better word, experimenting on HBCUs and black athletes?</p>
<p>Schwarz: I know people are wary about it because that’s almost always the first question that Ricky and I get when we go in and talk to university presidents. There’s a suspicion of a carpetbagger coming in here and feeding us a line. The good news is, if you go to our website and look at the seven or so people who are really leading the charge here, it’s not a majority white organization at this point. It was my idea, Ricky wrote the original business plan, but we have expanded so that some of that problem has gone away. And when we go to these meetings, generally we’re a mixed group.</p>
<p>I think it’s a perfectly valid question to ask: “Why do I care about HBCUs? Isn’t this just me trying to prove a point?” But I hope that anybody who goes to our website thinks about who’s investing in us ― we have an important executive in Silicon Valley who is black and is involved with programs connecting the tech community with HBCUs, we have people who’ve done their Ph.D.’s on the experience of black athletes at predominately white institutions. </p>
<p>HuffPost: Time for the classic question: Where does the money come from to pay these guys, and how much would they make?</p>
<p>Volante: We are not asking for a single dime from any school that’s participating in this. The way the plan’s been structured ... it’s club teams on these campuses. That’s done with the sole purpose in mind of protecting the universities. It’s not a fork in the road. It’s not, I turn right and stay with the NCAA, I turn left and go with HBL. This is very much a parallel path that we are going to be operating this club team on the campuses of these HBCUs and the varsity teams will continue to exist. They’ll still get their distributions from the NCAA for March Madness every year. This is complementary revenue, not replacement revenue.</p>
<p>The salaries and all the costs of the league are going to be covered initially by private investors. It will shift at a point, hopefully within the first season or two, that our revenues will cover any and all costs and there will be excess left over to not only provide additional payments and grow the salaries of our players, but also ensure that the financial incentive is there for the schools to want to continue to participate.</p>
<p>As to determining who gets paid what, much like in professional basketball, it will be driven by talent. Right now, the salaries will range from $50,000 to $100,000 per season. But that’s just a piece of what they get. If you’re Zion Williamson you’re going to get the maximum amount because you’re an elite talent. If you’re a guy who’s a very good basketball player but doesn’t have NBA potential, in that first season he might get $50,000 with the opportunity to grow his salary. The salary is determined year to year. </p>
<p>Schwarz: But to be clear, the scholarship piece is completely unconditional on quality of play. You get a five-year scholarship even if you go to the NBA after one season — you can come back and use that scholarship. </p>
<p>HuffPost: So you’re guaranteeing a full scholarship plus at least $50,000 a year? </p>
<p>Volante: The thing that gets the headlines is the compensation. Number two is the five-year guaranteed scholarship. Number three is where we start to get into the fringe benefits that any other employee at any place has: having a 401(k) set up, having an appropriate insurance plan, so these guys are going to be protected for injury. We’re going to help them monetize their social media accounts. So a player might walk out of college with a degree ― a real degree ― and also with savings that might be $300,000 to $500,000 or more.</p>
<p>HuffPost: Who are you targeting on the recruiting trail? The one-and-dones superstars of the world, or more of the mid-tier college basketball player whose NBA hopes are a little less real?</p>
<p>Volante: The shortest answer is both. We want all of them.</p>
<p>Schwarz: It’s not just a one-and-done. For that very next tier of folks who are really the bread and butter of what makes March Madness exciting to people ― we want to get that player. And we think, there, [that] the contrast in earnings is the greatest, between what that guy will earn maybe playing in the G-League for a couple years, or playing in Australia or wherever, and losing out on not just the best four years of his earnings but maybe the best six years of his earnings. We think our package is really superior in that spot.</p>
<p>HuffPost: What’s been the level of interest from the HBCUs?</p>
<p>Volante: We’ve spoken with between 12 and 15, including some of the biggest ones out there. We have a couple of schools that have told us that they would like to be involved, they would like to participate, however they do not want to be the first school to say yes. So finding that first-mover has definitely proven challenging for us. </p>
<p>HuffPost: There are 102 HBCUs across the United States. Are you trying to get all of them to join?</p>
<p>Volante: No. There’s a reason why, at least in the U.S., every sports league ends up hovering between 20 and 35 or so teams. Once you go beyond that, the overall cost of a single-entity operation becomes a net-negative as opposed to finding that optimal place. We’re hoping to reach that within five seasons. But the actual profile of the schools we’re trying to get falls into three buckets. Bucket one is an HBCU that you generally know, even the average person, so a Howard or a Hampton. [Number two is] schools that once upon a time, pre-desegregation, were athletic powerhouses, so examples there would be like Florida A&M or Texas Southern. And number three would be smaller institutions that unless you’re in that niche community you probably wouldn’t know, but the school is situated in a major metropolitan area. An example might be Xavier in New Orleans or Fisk in Nashville. </p>
<p>In year one, we want 12 or 16. Once we hit 12, the green light goes, we start recruiting players rapidly, and ramping things up.</p>
<p>Schwarz: I think the audience is ready for it. People your age, people Ricky’s age, are ready for it sooner than it feels like legislators would be ready for it. This is a situation where maybe democracy is lagging behind capitalism, in some sense. We don’t need every person in America to tune into our product to be successful. We just need a solid fan base that can cover the cost of a solid league, and we can grow from there. The idea that if some college programs paid their athletes, college sports will die is so silly. And we, among other things, are going to prove that.</p>
<p>HuffPost: Has the FBI investigation into college basketball changed your calculus? It seems to me that, say, an Adidas executive or an AAU coach might look around and say, “Why participate in a system that could get me thrown in jail, if there’s another league where all this is legal?”</p>
<p>Volante: That’s part of the pitch, at least to certain audiences. </p>
<p>Apparel company conversations have started. Adidas and some of the other bigger ones are going to be forced to change their business model soon if this DOJ investigation really does result in people going to prison. Because otherwise every time you send a representative out, you risk them being arrested. Those companies, sooner rather than later, are going to have to realize that either they continue going down the path they’re on with the NCAA, and don’t change the model and risk people and their lives ― or they align themselves with a model that doesn’t care, that realizes what they’re doing are everyday business practices in every other industry. So Adidas and Nike are primary targets of ours, but they’re certainly not the only ones out there.</p>
<p>Schwarz: One of the things we’re offering our athletes is that they can make their own shoe deal. </p>
<p>Volante: What has been the end goal of Adidas’ business model? It’s to eventually have those elite players who have gone to Louisville and other schools, that once they go to the NBA, they’re wearing Adidas shoes. Here you don’t have to have all those intermediate steps. Adidas or Nike can sign those players while they’re in the HBL, and they already have their shoe deal, and those companies can start building their brand around these guys. There’s a lot of potential value here, to Adidas or Nike or whatever company, to the players, and the schools will be getting the benefit the entire time. If the next Zion Williamson is playing for Grambling or Hampton or Howard, that school is going to constantly be in the forefront of peoples’ minds when they’re watching college basketball. You’re not going to think about Duke or Kentucky. You’re going to think about them.</p>
<p>HuffPost: So when’s the first game?</p>
<p>Volante: There are a ton of chicken-and-egg things going on. Every group of stakeholders is looking at each other and saying, “Are you in? Are you in? Are you in?” However, we are starting to break through those. We’ve been most successful on the investment front, and when you have more money, you’re able to do more things. So I think we’ll be able to ramp up our school recruitment effort significantly in the next couple months. And I would say realistically, the HBL’s inaugural season will tip off on Juneteenth 2020.</p>

<p>Two students singing the national anthem with a grade-school choir took a knee at a Seattle Mariners game Sunday.</p>
<p>A tweet by sports writer Ryan S. Clark of the Tacoma News Tribune shows the children at Safeco Field kneeling alongside their standing classmates from Seattle’s Mount View Elementary School. Colin Kaepernick retweeted the picture.</p>
<p>There was video, too.</p>
<p>The apparent protest before the Mariners played the Cleveland Indians follows more than a year of controversy. Athletes have been kneeling during the anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Seattle’s Highline Public Schools called it an “individual act by the students.”</p>
<p>“Obviously, the school district respects the First Amendment rights of our students,” Catherine Carbone Rogers told HuffPost.</p>
<p>Kaepernick began the practice of “taking a knee” during “The Star-Spangled Banner” as a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers. The movement spread to other players and NFL teams ― and even eventually to members of youth teams.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly objected to the on-field activism. </p>
<p>On Sunday, the sight of young performers kneeling during the anthem ― and in front of the presentation of flags ― at an MLB game predictably divided Twitter users.</p>
<p>While many had praise, others speculated the kids’ parents were behind the demonstration.</p>
<p>Some sports outlets applauded the move.</p>
<p>“The two young girls who kneeled during their performance at Sunday’s Mariners game are trailblazers, demonstrating that the quest for racial equality and social justice has support from a new generation,” Yahoo Sports wrote.</p>
<p>USA Today’s For The Win said: “Kids these days are not going to accept being spectators for important discussions regarding the communities in which they live. The future is in good hands.”</p>

<p>The Vegas Golden Knights, the city’s National Hockey League team, honored the 58 victims of the Oct. 1 mass shooting before the start of their home game Saturday.</p>
<p>A banner hung from the rafters at T-Mobile Arena with the 58 names of those killed nearly six months earlier at a country music festival in Las Vegas when 64-year-old gunman Stephen Paddock fired hundreds of rounds into the crowd from his hotel room.</p>
<p>“Tonight, we fly 58 stars in the sky as a reminder that the 58 will always be with us,” the arena’s announcer told the crowd. The team also retired jersey No. 58 as a tribute to the slain individuals.</p>
<p>Before the players took to the ice, the victims’ names and the phrase “VEGAS STRONG” were projected onto the rink.</p>
<p>“The 58 will always be with us,” the team’s official Twitter account tweeted.</p>

<p>Scott Foster had some story to tell around the office water cooler on Friday.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old accountant and beer-league hockey player filled in as an emergency goalie in his NHL debut, helping the Chicago Blackhawks to a 6-2 victory over the visiting Winnipeg Jets Thursday night.</p>
<p>After two goaltenders on the Blackhawks roster went down, Foster was called into action in the third period, according to reports. He stopped all seven shots fired at him in 14 minutes. In the waning moments, the United Center crowd chanted his name.</p>
<p>Foster, a former Western Michigan goaltender (2002-06), had attended a dozen or so Blackhawks games as a fail-safe backup. He told reporters afterward (watch above) that he usually sits in the press box and eats dinner.</p>
<p>Not this time.</p>
<p>In one of sports’ true Walter Mitty moments, the married father of two got to do what most people can only dream of: star for their local major league team.</p>
<p>After that, balancing a ledger might not pack the same thrill.</p>
<p>“A few hours ago I was sitting on the computer typing on a 10-key,” Foster said afterward. “Now I’m standing in front of you guys having just finished 14 and a half minutes of NHL hockey.”</p>
<p>According to the Chicago Tribune, Foster, from nearby Oak Park, will be back in goal Friday ― in the Johnny’s Icehouse Adult League after his shift at Golub Capital.</p>
<p>Well, it was glorious while it lasted.</p>

<p>Artist Emanuel Santos gained worldwide notoriety last year when he unveiled his bust of soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo. Not the good kind of notoriety.</p>
<p>The piece is stationed in Ronaldo’s birthplace of Madeira, Portugal, at the airport that now bears his name. You might describe it as an ... interesting interpretation. </p>
<p>The internet meme machine was savage to say the least, and Santos took the negative response very hard. Santos and his family had a rough time in the weeks and months that followed the unveiling, telling Bleacher Report that he suffered from feelings of humiliation and isolation. </p>
<p>Bleacher Report challenged Santos to try again, and the artist accepted. The outlet documented the process (in the video above) and, as you can see, the new bust is light-years beyond the original in terms of accuracy.</p>

<p>Police have arrested a former Michigan State University dean who supervised ex-USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar before the sports doctor was arrested and convicted of sexually abusing female athletes, the county sheriff said on Monday.</p>
<p>“William Strampel is currently lodged at the Ingham County jail,” Ingham County Sheriff Scott Wriggelsworth told Reuters. </p>
<p>Wriggelsworth declined to say on what charges Strampel, 70, was arrested until the defendant was arraigned at a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday.</p>
<p>A jail website listed the former dean of Michigan State’s College of Osteopathic Medicine as an inmate there but gave no other information.</p>
<p>The Detroit Free-Press newspaper reported that he faces multiple charges, at least one a felony.</p>
<p>An attorney for Strampel, who has been on medical leave from the university since December, could not be reached by Reuters for comment on Monday evening.</p>
<p>Michigan State University President John Engler said in February he was moving to revoke tenure for Strampel for failing to enforce 2014 guidelines created for Nassar in treating young athletes after complaints of sexual misconduct against him.</p>
<p>The college has been criticized for its handling of complaints about Nassar stretching back for years.</p>
<p>Michigan State terminated Nassar in September 2016 for his failure to follow those protocols, including having another person present when he performed the procedures.</p>
<p>Numerous women said they were assaulted even after the guidelines were put in place.</p>
<p>Nassar was sentenced in February to up to 125 years in prison after some 200 young women testified about decades of abuse at his hands.</p>
<p>He had already received a sentence up to 175 years in a neighboring Michigan county, and was sentenced to a 60-year federal term for child pornography convictions.</p>

<p>ATLANTA—Sister Jean’s Happy Ramblers are headed to the Final Four.</p>
<p>Loyola Chicago defeated Kansas State 78-62 Saturday night in a South regional final that wasn’t ever particularly close, but still a lot of fun for everyone not wearing purple. The Ramblers used a combination of surgical interior slices and backbreaking three-pointers to disrupt K-State from every angle, and the Wildcats had no reliable answer on either end of the court. Now, the unlikeliest story of the 2018 NCAA Tournament gets another chapter.</p>
<p>Loyola began its second half against Nevada on Thursday night shooting an ungodly – wait, let’s not use that word for Sister Jean’s team; let’s say “impressive” – 13-for-13. The Ramblers followed that up by draining their first nine shots from the field on Saturday, kicked off by Cameron Krutwig. Sidelined much of Thursday night with foul trouble, Krutwig threw his beef into the fray Saturday night, thundering for seven crucial points and five rebounds at the half.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, Kansas State couldn’t get anything started on offense, and couldn’t slow Loyola on defense. Barry Brown Jr. was a slashing marvel, and Xavier Sneed filled the hoop from outside, but they were the lone highlights from the KSU side. The Wildcats couldn’t catch up to Loyola’s slash-and-pass game, and even on the rare instances when K-State could force Loyola into turnovers, the deficit didn’t shrink to any less than five. The score at the half: Loyola 36, K-State 24.</p>
<p>The teams traded baskets early in the second half, a time when trading baskets simply would not do for K-State. The minutes shrank and the deficit didn’t. The key moment, emotionally speaking, came with just under 17 minutes remaining in the game. Krutwig kicked the ball out to Richardson beyond the arc; K-State’s Kamau Stokes charged out toward him, but couldn’t get there before Richardson released the ball, and couldn’t stop after. Three-point bucket, and-1 shot Richardson lay on the floor and spread out his arms and legs, starfish style, a broad grin on his face.</p>
<p>And the hits kept on coming. A Donte Ingram two-pointer got changed to a three during an official timeout; Loyola was so good at scoring it was putting points on the board even during commercials. Krutwig rolled in an ugly-but-still-good layup, Custer hit a long three-pointer, and Ingram sliced right through the bewildered K-State defense for an up-and-under bucket, and suddenly Loyola was up by 19 with 14 minutes remaining, and even the most pessimistic of souls started to dare to hope.</p>
<p>The chants of “L-U-C!” from the Gryffindor-scarved Rambler faithful grew louder and louder as K-State’s hopes of a miracle comeback grew dimmer and dimmer. Kansas State’s offensive sets fell into a depressing pattern of one-shot-and-gone; at the other end of the court, Loyola seemed able to finger-roll in featherlight shots from anywhere on the court.</p>
<p>The deficit was a wall too high to climb. Even when Kansas State put together a 10-0 run with about five minutes left in the game, the Wildcats were still down 13. Richardson halted that run with another three-pointer, his sixth of the night on seven shots, and K-State’s shoulders visibly sagged. And when Stokes’ own attempt at a clutch three ringed the hoop and inexplicably popped out:</p>
<p>…well, that was about it for the Wildcats. Loyola began stretching the floor and devouring clock, and Kansas State could only foul and hope.</p>
<p>Kansas State can look back on this tournament with pride, having knocked off one of the nation’s marquee programs in Kentucky on Thursday night. But Loyola’s got a lot more to look forward to. We’re not through with you yet, Sister Jean.</p>

<p>Former professional hockey player Larry Kwong died this past Thursday at age 94 in Calgary, Canada. </p>
<p>The Chinese-Canadian athlete, the son of Chinese immigrants, was a pioneer in his sport, becoming the first person of color to play in the National Hockey League. </p>
<p>“I broke the ice a little bit,” Kwong told The New York Times in 2013. “Maybe being the first Chinese player in the N.H.L. gave more of a chance for other Chinese boys that play hockey.”</p>
<p>Kwong played just one major league game with the New York Rangers on March 13, 1948, after being called up from the New York Rovers farm team, and battled racism and discrimination on his way to the NHL. </p>
<p>The hockey player was born in Vernon, British Columbia, in 1923, the year Canada passed the Chinese Immigration Act. The legislation, enacted during a time of fierce anti-Chinese sentiment across the country, essentially banned all forms of Chinese immigration and wasn’t repealed for more than two decades.</p>
<p>Kwong, whose parents ran a grocery store, quickly became aware of the racism in the country. Chinese-Canadians were denied the right to vote, Kwong couldn’t find a job in his hometown, and barbers even refused to cut his hair because of his ethnicity.</p>
<p>“When I was a young boy, I couldn’t just go to any barber shop. They won’t take me because I was Chinese. It didn’t make me feel good,” Kwong recalled, according to CHBC. “It made me feel that I can’t just go to a certain place or restaurant. I would have to make sure they don’t mind and let me go in.” </p>
<p>Hockey became an escape for Kwong, The New York Times mentioned. And he joined his first organized team, the Vernon Hydrophones, in the late 1930s. He later moved up to the Trail Smoke Eaters, a team that promised its players a high-paying gig at a local smelter. The Chinese-Canadian player, however, was denied the job due to his heritage and was instead given work as a hotel bellhop. </p>
<p>Kwong was drafted into the military during World War II, playing hockey to entertain the troops while also building minesweepers in the shipyard. Later on, a scout finally noticed Kwong’s talent for the sport at a Rangers tryout camp and Kwong landed a spot on the Rovers. </p>
<p>Though Kwong became the team’s top scorer in his second year with the team, he witnessed many other players get called up to the Rangers before him, The Globe and Mail noted. When he finally got the chance to play for the major league team, he was given just one minute on the ice. </p>
<p>“Just a minute. So what can you do in a minute? Unless you’re a real magician, what can you do in a minute?” he told the Multicultural History Society of Ontario. </p>
<p>Kwong left the NHL at the end of the season but continued playing several successful years in the Quebec Senior Hockey League and later overseas. </p>
<p>After his sports career, he returned to his family’s grocery business, retiring in 1996.</p>
<p>Kwong’s legacy in the sports world was solidified by his 2010 induction into the B.C. Hockey Hall of Fame and his 2013 induction in to the B.C. Sports Hall of Fame in Vancouver, among many other accolades.</p>
<p>The pioneer is survived by a sister, daughter and two grandchildren. </p>

<p>Sister Jean Dolores-Schmidt, the 98-year-old nun and team chaplain of NCAA Tournament upstart Loyola University Chicago, has become the darling of March Madness.</p>
<p>But WKGN-AM radio host Cody McClure in Knoxville, Tennessee, figured some irreverence was called for after No. 11 seed Loyola upset No. 3 University of Tennessee on Saturday to reach the Sweet 16.</p>
<p>“Fuck Sister Jean -everyone,” he wrote in a now-deleted tweet captured in a screenshot.</p>
<p>On Monday, McClure wasn’t backing down. “I don’t regret the joke, no I don’t, because of the fact it was a joke,’’ McClure told the Chicago Tribune. “For me, I’m wondering when are we as a society going to learn how to take a joke again?”</p>
<p>However, McClure did suggest a “sorry” could be possible.</p>
<p>“I would issue an apology to Sister Jean,’’ he said to the paper. “If this were to ever get back to Sister Jean, I would hope that she understood that it was meant to be nothing more than a joke. I’m not some kind of monster. I mean, who would in their heart hate an elderly nun?”</p>
<p>McClure said his boss had told him that he would not be fired.</p>
<p>But if the radio host thinks he’s going to win the public relations war, he likely doesn’t have a prayer.</p>
<p>Loyola Chicago will play the University of Nevada on Thursday in Atlanta.</p>

<p>Nevada basketball coach Eric Musselman was so overjoyed at his team’s unlikely comeback Sunday that he couldn’t keep his shirt on.</p>
<p>Moments after the University of Nevada, Reno, Wolf Pack overcame a 22-point deficit to defeat No. 2 seed Cincinnati in the NCAA tournament’s second round, Musselman entered the locker room stripped to the waist and ready to celebrate.</p>
<p>Junior Caleb Martin humorously explained that Musselman was looking for an opportunity to show off his physique.</p>
<p>“Coach works out every morning, so his shirt comes off a lot,” Martin said in the postgame press conference, above.</p>
<p>Musselman’s skin-baring enthusiasm was still more family-friendly than his F-bomb revelry on the air after his team’s overtime victory against Texas in the first round.</p>
<p>“It’s the happiest I’ve ever been in my life,” he told reporters on Sunday.</p>

<p>While playing in an Eastern Conference playoff game for the Miami Heat, LeBron James reportedly gained 7 pounds, according to ESPN’s Brian Windhorst. </p>
<p>The anecdote appears in a story Windhorst published Monday, chronicling James’ renewed effort to maintain his health deeper into the season. Of the rapid 7-pound gain, Windhorst writes that “teammates saw the scale and attest to it in amazement,” and James himself calls the incident “weird as hell.”</p>
<p>Did James consume 7 pounds of water and food over the course of the game? Or is the basketball star putting us all on, stoking the fires of his legend?</p>
<p>We’ll probably never know ― not that it matters. James certainly doesn’t need a story like this to solidify his place among the greatest basketball players of all time.</p>
<p>Still, Twitter reactions to the ESPN story were entertaining.</p>

<p>Tennis great Martina Navratilova said her salary for Wimbledon commentary was no match for John McEnroe’s ― and she’s slamming the BBC for the disparity.</p>
<p>Navratilova said in a BBC Panorama documentary to air Monday that McEnroe earned at least 10 times more than she did for BBC coverage of the Grand Slam tournament.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to really compare exactly because some people work a little longer days, maybe a few more programs or whatever,” Navratilova said in a preview clip of “Britain’s Equal Pay Scandal,” posted by BBC Panorama (watch above). “But overall, it was a shock because John McEnroe makes at least 150,000 pounds. I get about 15,000 pounds for Wimbledon. And unless John McEnroe’s doing a whole bunch of stuff outside of Wimbledon, he’s getting at least 10 times as much money than I am for very comparable work.”</p>
<p>Navratilova made about 10 appearances compared with 30 for McEnroe during Wimbledon, BBC Panorama estimated, per the Telegraph.</p>
<p>BBC Sport told the Guardian that McEnroe’s participation was of “a different scale, scope and time commitment.”</p>
<p>“Along with Sue Barker, John is regarded as the face of our Wimbledon coverage,” a spokeswoman said. “He is a defining voice within the BBC’s coverage. He is widely considered to be the best expert/commentator in the sport, highly valued by our audiences and his contract means he cannot work for another UK broadcaster without our permission. His pay reflects all of this – gender isn’t a factor.”</p>
<p>McEnroe’s earnings came to light last year when the BBC published a list of its highest-paid personalities, putting his pay between £150,000 and £199,999 ($210,560 to $280,740), HuffPost UK reported. The tennis championships last about two weeks.</p>
<p>When told that the BBC may use McEnroe’s greater hours as a defense, Navratilova said the disparity still didn’t add up. She said she was told that she and McEnroe were making a comparable wage.</p>
<p>“It makes me angry for the other women that I think go through this,” she said.</p>
<p>Reps for McEnroe didn’t immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment.</p>

<p>William D. Strampel, the longtime boss of convicted pedophile Larry Nassar and former dean of Michigan State University’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, said in 2016 that he didn’t believe the athletes who accused Nassar of sexual abuse, The Wall Street Journal reports.</p>
<p>Strampel supervised Nassar for almost 15 years during Nassar’s tenure as MSU’s team doctor, during which time Nassar sexually abused hundreds of athletes. He stepped down as dean in 2017 due to medical reasons and amid backlash that he had ignored complaints about Nassar. Strampel is still an MSU employee and is named as a defendant in several civil lawsuits against MSU.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal recently obtained notes from an October 2016 meeting with four students and three MSU administrators about a separate incident of sexual assault between a female and male student. According to the notes, Strampel brushed off the female student’s accusation and pointed to Nassar as an example of how people often lie about abuse:</p>
<p> “This just goes to show that none of you learned the most basic lesson in medicine, medicine 101, that you should have learned in your first week: don’t trust your patients,” Dr. Strampel is quoted saying. “Patients lie to get doctors in trouble. And we’re seeing that right now in the news with this Nassar stuff. I don’t think any of these women were actually assaulted by Larry, but Larry didn’t learn that lesson and didn’t have a chaperone in the room, so now they see an opening and they can take advantage of him.” According to the written account, he added: “As soon as I found out I had to fire his ass. I didn’t want to, but what am I supposed to do?” </p>
<p>One of the people at the meeting told the news outlet that everyone in the meeting was shocked by Strampel’s comments. “He can’t possibly be serious,” the person said. </p>
<p>Read more at The Wall Street Journal. </p>
<p>Nassar was fired from MSU over allegations of sexual abuse in September 2016, only a few weeks before this meeting. He was arrested in November of the same year on child pornography charges. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for MSU told HuffPost that the university will not speak on behalf of Strampel, but pointed out that MSU’s interim President John Engler did begin the process of terminating Strampel’s employment in February. </p>
<p>“William Strampel did not act with the level of professionalism we expect from individuals who hold senior leadership positions, particularly in a position that involves student and patient safety,” Engler said at the time. “We are sending an unmistakable message today that we will remove employees who do not treat students, faculty, staff or anyone else in our community in an appropriate manner.”</p>
<p>The termination process for Strampel could take up to a year. </p>
<p>MSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Strampel could not be reached for comment. </p>
<p>MSU and its administration have been put on blast for how the university failed to protect its students. According to an explosive report from The Detroit News, at least 14 MSU staffers and representatives were told of Nassar’s abuse but did nothing to stop it. </p>
<p>According to court records, Nassar abused at least 265 children and young athletes during his time at MSU and as the USA Gymnastics team doctor. Last year, Nassar was sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. He was recently sentenced to two separate sentences of up to 175 years on child sexual abuse. </p>

<p>Michigan entered the NCAA tournament as a hot pick for the Final Four and a Vegas favorite to outplay its No. 3 seed.</p>
<p>Houston had other ideas Saturday in a second-round NCAA matchup, seemingly having the game in hand with senior forward Devin Davis securing a rebound and picking up a foul with 3.9 seconds left and the Cougars holding a 63-61 lead.</p>
<p>But Davis missed both of his free throws, setting up freshman Jordan Poole and the Wolverines for a moment they will never forget.</p>
<p>Poole’s desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer on a pass from senior guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman secured a 64-63 Michigan win and a date next weekend in the Sweet 16.</p>
<p>Poole told reporters that he didn’t even know the shot went in until he saw the reaction from the Michigan bench.</p>
<p>“We work on that play thousands of times in practice,” Poole said. “We executed it perfectly, especially from the inbounds pass, getting it to our senior guard Muhammad. Ham could have put the shot up easily, but he had the confidence to find me, and I just knocked the shot down.</p>
<p>“I think the guys on the team know that I never lose confidence. You’ve just got to always be ready for the opportunity and for the moment.”</p>
<p>Poole, a streaky shooter and spot rotation player hitting 37.8 percent of his 3-pointers, entered the game on a cold run, having scored just 16 points in the Wolverines’ previous five games. In contrast, he hit five 3-pointers against Indiana on Dec. 2. </p>
<p>He obviously found his stroke at the right time.</p>
<p>He finished the game with eight points on 3-of-5 shooting from the field in 11 minutes off the bench.</p>
<p>“We had him in the scout team earlier in the year because he was still growing and was not a guy that was in our top nine,” Michigan coach Jim Beilein said of Poole after the game. “And the shot clock would get down and, you know, the first team’s all excited they’re going to get a stop, and he’d put in a buzzer shot.”</p>
<p>Davis, meanwhile, was great at the line throughout the game but missed three of his last four free throws as he finished 9-of-12 from the stripe.</p>
<p>It was a stunning finish that demonstrated the immense joy and devastating heartbreak the NCAA tournament is known for.</p>
<p>The game was tight throughout as both teams struggled to score and traded the lead 17 times. Houston shot 37 percent from the field while Michigan managed to hit 35.6 percent of its field goals.</p>
<p>Junior forward Mortiz Wagner did most of the damage for Michigan with 12 points, seven rebounds and three assists while Abdur-Rahkman also logged 12 points. Charles Matthews and Duncan Robinson were the only other Wolverines in double figures with 11 points each.</p>
<p>Rob Gray, Houston’s leading scorer, filled up the box score with 23 points and 10 rebounds, but needed 22 shots to get there. Davis put in a productive 35 minutes, logging 17 points and seven rebounds that will be of little solace after he missed those final free throws.</p>
<p>Michigan will move on to face the winner of Sunday’s matchup between North Carolina and Texas A&M. The Wolverines will depend on the stifling defense that led them to the Big Ten tournament title and through the first weekend of the NCAA tournament, but will likely need more from their offense to advance to the next round.</p>
<p>But Saturday’s not a night for Michigan to contemplate what’s next. It’s a night for celebration.</p>

<p> A minor league baseball team in Pennsylvania released a player after a TV station posted video of him beating his girlfriend when he played on a Texas team, according to news outlets. The Lancaster Barnstormers fired outfielder Danry Vasquez after KRIS-TV showed security camera video from Aug. 2, 2016, that captured him repeatedly hitting a woman and pulling her hair. “There is no choice but to sever the relationship,” Ross Peeples, manager of the independent Lancaster team, said on Facebook Wednesday. “Neither I, nor the Barnstormers’ organization as a whole, can condone or associate with that behavior.” The security clip (below) shows Vasquez attacking the woman in a stairwell at the stadium of the Class AA Corpus Christi Hooks, a Houston Astros affiliate, where Vasquez had been a player. Please note the following video may be disturbing to some viewers. </p>
<p> The Astros released Vasquez, 24, after the abuse, and Major League Baseball suspended him. He played back home in Venezuela afterward, and resurfaced with the Barnstormers at the start of the year, The Washington Post reported. Vasquez was charged with assault in the Texas attack, and last week completed a plea deal to dismiss the charges after paying a fine and taking classes, Mark Gonzalez, the district attorney in Nueces County, Texas, told KRIS.  CORRECTION: A previous version of this story cited an erroneous TMZ report that initially indicated Vasquez and the girlfriend he attacked got engaged after the incident.  </p>

<p>Traditionally, when a U.S. professional sports team wins a championship, the president invites the team to the White House for a meet-and-greet.</p>
<p>Some athletes have opted out of invitations to President Donald Trump’s White House because of his divisive politics. Many Philadelphia Eagles players have already said they would not be attending should the invitation be offered to the Super Bowl champs.</p>
<p>On Monday, the World Series champion Houston Astros got their turn to meet the president. While we don’t specifically know American League MVP José Altuve’s politics, the second baseman made it clear he was not there for Trump.</p>
<p>For the majority of the event, Altuve stood stone-faced, hands at his side, most notably when Trump went down the line shaking hands.</p>
<p>Oof, that’s cold.</p>
<p>Altuve did shake the president’s hand when being singled out, and he appeared gracious when the president complimented him, but there was a tinge of awkward hesitation in the air.</p>
<p>Trump tweeted about the meeting Monday evening. Altuve is smiling with everyone in the official group photo, but the rest of the time Altuve looks more business than pleasure. </p>
<p>Grab some snacks at the concession stand and get comfy, though, because we probably have at least a few more riveting photo ops of pro athletes visiting the Trump White House.</p>

<p>Miami Heat basketball star Dwyane Wade dropped by Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School on Wednesday to thank students for their inspiring response to last month’s mass shooting at their Parkland, Florida, campus.</p>
<p>Students and school staff flooded social media with photos and videos from Wade’s visit. The shooting guard, who has called for gun safety in the wake of the massacre, spoke as students excitedly crowded around him.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to come and say I’m inspired by all of you,” Wade told the students, many of whom are involved in organizing the upcoming March for Our Lives to demand stronger gun legislation. </p>
<p>“As someone out here in the public eye, I’m proud to say I’m from this state because of you guys, because of the future of this world because of you guys,” he continued. </p>
<p>Wade, who was traded back to the Heat just a week before a teen gunman killed 17 students and faculty members at the high school on Feb. 14, has vowed to help spotlight the victims and the survivors’ fight for gun control. </p>
<p>He said he was especially touched after learning one of the teenaged victims, Joaquin Oliver, was buried in a Heat jersey bearing Wade’s name and number.</p>
<p>“You’re about to make me cry,” Wade tweeted when he learned of Joaquin’s burial. He dedicated this season to the teen, saying in a tweet: “This is why we will not just SHUT up and dribble!” ― a response to Fox News host Laura Ingraham urging basketball players to stay out of the gun control discussion.</p>
<p>Wade invited Oliver’s family to a Heat game earlier this month and delivered an emotional tribute at the time.</p>
<p>“We honor the 17 lives that were tragically lost in Parkland,” he said. “We applaud the fearless students that are fighting for their lives. We will also make sure that their voices are heard around gun safety. You are our nation’s inspiration. We salute you and we support you.”</p>
<p>Neither the Heat nor the high school immediately responded to HuffPost’s request for more details about Wade’s visit.</p>

<p>Last year during a home game against the Atlanta Hawks, Kevin Love of the Cleveland Cavaliers experienced his first panic attack.</p>
<p>The episode not only forced the NBA power forward to leave the game at halftime, it forced him to open up about his struggle with mental health.</p>
<p>In an essay for the Players’ Tribune published Tuesday, the 29-year-old athlete detailed what happened when he was hospitalized mid-game in November, how he suffered silently and why he’s speaking out about mental health now.</p>
<p>“It came out of nowhere. I’d never had one before. I didn’t even know if they were real,” Love wrote of his panic attack. </p>
<p>“But it was real — as real as a broken hand or a sprained ankle. Since that day, almost everything about the way I think about my mental health has changed.”</p>
<p>While Love detailed his panic attack in November, his essay didn’t mention what happened when he left a Jan. 22 game due to an undisclosed illness and later missed a practice. His teammates were reportedly upset over his absences, though things settled down once Love explained to the team during a meeting what was going on, ESPN reported at the time.</p>
<p>After Love’s essay was published, Cleveland.com reported Tuesday that Love had disclosed his panic attacks during that meeting.</p>
<p>Love said he had recovered from the November incident and performed successfully at a game two days later, but something else had begun troubling him: “Why was I so concerned with people finding out?” </p>
<p>Love eventually found help through therapy, which he said he had never thought he’d pursue. Through those sessions, Love wrote, he discovered issues beyond the pressures of the NBA that were weighing him down, including the death of his grandmother.</p>
<p>“In the short time I’ve been meeting with the therapist, I’ve seen the power of saying things out loud in a setting like that,” Love wrote. “And it’s not some magical process. It’s terrifying and awkward and hard, at least in my experience so far.”</p>
<p>Love said he was inspired to speak out about his mental health issues after the Toronto Raptors’ DeMar DeRozan revealed last month that he has been struggling with depression, feelings of loneliness and anxiety.</p>
<p>DeRozan hinted at his issues in a tweet in late February, then later expanded on his experience in an interview with The Toronto Star.</p>
<p>“This is real stuff,” DeRozan told the Star. “We’re all human at the end of the day.</p>
<p>The Toronto guard added, “My mom always told me: Never make fun of anybody because you never know what that person is going through.”</p>
<p>In his essay, Love said that men especially need to know it’s OK to speak up about their feelings ― something he had been uncomfortable with for most of his life.</p>
<p>“If you’re suffering silently like I was, then you know how it can feel like nobody really gets it,” Love wrote, before noting what pushed him to write his piece.</p>
<p> Partly, I want to do it for me, but mostly, I want to do it because people don’t talk about mental health enough. And men and boys are probably the farthest behind. I know it from experience. Growing up, you figure out really quickly how a boy is supposed to act. You learn what it takes to “be a man.” It’s like a playbook: Be strong. Don’t talk about your feelings. Get through it on your own. So for 29 years of my life, I followed that playbook. </p>
<p>The stigma around mental health is a very serious problem for men.</p>
<p>A 2015 survey found that men are more likely than women to hide thoughts of suicide. And, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, white men accounted for 7 out of 10 suicides in 2016, while the rate of suicide is highest for middle-aged men.</p>
<p>Love addressed this in his essay, calling it an invisible struggle men have to face.</p>
<p>“Look, I’m probably not telling you anything new here,” Love wrote.</p>
<p>“These values about men and toughness are so ordinary that they’re everywhere … and invisible at the same time, surrounding us like air or water,” he added. “They’re a lot like depression or anxiety in that way.”</p>
<p>Loves’ teammates, and other NBA players, have praised Love for being courageous enough to speak up about his struggles. Now, in response to all of the support, the Cavaliers’ forward is asking for others to share their own stories with him.</p>

<p>At least he kept his shirt on. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who likes to show off his athletic skills (and sometimes his pecs), juggled a soccer ball in a video posted Monday to hype the World Cup in Russia this summer.</p>

<p>Wearing a suit and tie, Putin plays briefly with FIFA President Gianni Infantino and then taps a header for the 100th hit ― signifying the 100th day ― at the end of the video. It appears some generous editing helped the Russian president keep the ball in the air.</p>

<p>Jacob Moore, the first male to publicly accuse former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse, said he hopes his story encourages other male survivors to come forward.</p>
<p>“I hope he rots in hell,” Moore, 18, said of Nassar on NBC News’ “Today” show on Tuesday. </p>
<p>Nassar has been accused of abusing over 260 young girls and women during decades as team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. He’s now serving three concurrent sentences of up to 175 years on child sexual abuse and child pornography charges. Moore became the first male to accuse Nassar in a federal lawsuit filed last week alleging the former doctor molested him in 2016.</p>
<p>Moore, now a freshman at the University of Michigan, said Nassar abused him under the guise of treatment for a shoulder injury when he was 16 years old.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t a dumb kid, I knew kind of what medical practices were and that one was out of the ordinary,” Moore said Tuesday. “Coming out of the treatment, I felt very uncomfortable.” </p>
<p>Moore said he “kind of freaked out” when abuse allegations against Nassar became public, and he couldn’t find an explanation for the treatment he received. </p>
<p>Moore’s sister, who also has accused Nassar of abusing her, testified during a January sentencing hearing for the doctor in which she mentioned her brother had been victimized. Both siblings are gymnasts.</p>
<p>“My whole family was fooled by you, but I know now who you really are,” Kamerin Moore told the serial predator.</p>
<p>Jacob Moore said his entire family has been affected by Nassar’s abuse.</p>
<p>“Me and my sister shouldn’t be able to relate over the fact that we’ve both been abused,” he said. “That’s just really sickening to me, that he would violate our trust like that … the things that he did were just awful.” </p>
<p>President Donald Trump recently signed a bill that aims to protect amateur athletes from sexual assault in the wake of the Nassar scandal.</p>
<p>In January, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) announced that his office will conduct an “independent, thorough, transparent and prompt” investigation into MSU and its handling of the Nassar case. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos also has said the Department of Education will investigate how MSU handled the Nassar allegations.</p>

<p>In the days after three UCLA men’s basketball players were arrested in China for allegedly shoplifting during a November visit, emails and letters poured in to university Chancellor Gene Block from angry fans, alumni and people with no connection to the school at all. There were hundreds and hundreds of messages, some written with perfect grammar and sober typefaces, others screeching and incoherent and laid out in Comic Sans. One author, a self-identified former UCLA crew letterman, somberly informed the chancellor that he was enclosing his old varsity sweater. </p>
<p>The three players ― LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill ― are black. Was the furious reaction about race? Not at all, said one correspondent, a little unconvincingly: “My decision is not based on the color of the skin of these thieves. Of my six grandchildren four are biracial.”</p>
<p>Very much so, said another: “Don’t surprise me you LOOK LIKE A FUDGPACKING FAGGOT !@ YOU SHOULD BE SO PROUD, 3 MONKEYS GETTING FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE RIDE AND EMBARRASS YO SCHOOL BY ACTING LIKE THE NIGGERS THEY APPARENTLY ARE !” </p>
<p>And on and on they went, the emails nearly universal in their disdain for the athletes. Many of them were clearly spurred on by the involvement of President Donald Trump, who was just then initiating a feud with LaVar Ball, father of LiAngelo. HuffPost obtained the emails via a public records request, and in them the whole modern American backlash is on display. Expressions of lofty disapproval, bloodthirsty formalism, coded racism, frank racism — hey, hey, the gang’s all here.</p>
<p>“They have embarrassed their country as well as their race,” read one note. “They put shame on UCLA, their race and our country,” read another. “3 JERKS — DISGRACED THE COLLEGE — OUR COUNTRY AND THEIR RACE!” read a third, this one a handwritten letter.</p>
<p>The full collection of emails and letters, all 637 pages, appears at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>First, some background: Ball, Riley and Hill, all freshmen, were arrested on Nov. 7 during the UCLA team’s early-season trip to China to play Georgia Tech. The players, according to Chinese authorities and later by their own admissions, had stolen sunglasses and other merchandise from three department stores in Hangzhou. </p>
<p>On Nov. 15, Block and UCLA suspended the players indefinitely. Ball has since left the program to play professionally overseas. Hill and Riley are serving one-season suspensions. </p>
<p>The arrests became a national story in part because of Trump, who claimed credit for helping the players avoid a possible 10-year prison sentence in China. Some of the emails sent to Block took their cues from Trump’s version of events. “Never again should anyone be allowed to commit a crime where President Trump has to come to UCLA’s rescue. It is absolutely disgusting,” one correspondent wrote. “The man who probably stands against just about everything the UCLA community defends comes to the rescue of people who unfortunately are associated with UCLA.”</p>
<p>ESPN has since reported that UCLA officials had resolved the issue with Chinese authorities before they heard from Trump or White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. </p>
<p>It was a simple case of minor theft, but from the wailing of the emails you might have thought the players had rampaged through the Forbidden City. Nothing short of the total annihilation of the young men’s academic and professional lives would suffice in the eyes of many of the emailers. The players deserved the full force of American (and perhaps even Chinese) law for having swiped and ultimately returned a few pairs of sunglasses and other merchandise. One emailer told Block to “recommend that they not be rewarded with any professional contracts.”</p>
<p>Time and again, emailers returned to the theme that the players were “entitled” athletes who didn’t truly belong in college, especially not one as prestigious as UCLA. This racist exceptionalism ― the idea that black men can only earn their way into college through athletic talent ― flows in part from the reality of the school’s population. Black men make up only about 3 percent of the male student body at UCLA, and a majority of them are athletes. As a viral video produced by students noted, the university has had more national sports championships in its history than it had black male freshmen in 2013’s enrollment class. </p>
<p>In the emails, the usual racial code words were frequently deployed. The athletes were called some variation of “entitled” or “spoiled” nearly 50 times. “Stupid,” “arrogant” and “above the law” also appeared regularly. There were at least 18 uses of “thug,” as in “entitled millionaire thugs,” in 14 separate emails. The players were also labeled “ingrates,” “fucking embarrassing morons,” “miscreant prima donnas” and “reprobates.”</p>
<p>More than a dozen times, emailers explicitly referenced their own status as “taxpayers,” as if to suggest (in one writer’s view) that they were tired of “subsidizing” athletes like Ball, Riley and Hill.</p>
<p>And sometimes, the emailers dispensed with the racial coding altogether. One subject line: “Black Basketball Thieves.” Another message declared that what the players did was “Super-Idiocy!” It went on: “And you’re going to let these morons earn a college degree at UCLA? Looks like they fulfill the stereotype of a ‘simpleton black athlete.’”</p>
<p>The batch of emails included one that seemed to link the players to Michael Brown, the teenager shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. “It’s when people like them get away with stealing from shops that people like [redacted] feel just as entitled to do the same in Missouri.” </p>
<p>In the documents provided to HuffPost, UCLA appears to have redacted the players’ names and any specific identification of them, as a way of formally protecting their identities. But you don’t need a decoder ring to figure out what these passages are trying to say (sic throughout):</p>
<p> UCLA must send a strong message on what it expects from such role models ― let’s not lie to ourselves, that’s what they are to millions of young [redacted] males. It’s when people like them get away with stealing from shops that people like [redacted] feel just as entitled to do the same in Missouri. Then he gets angry when someone tries to stop him, and he charges at the cop ― and gets shot. It all starts when responsible institutions like UCLA give up on their responsibilities. Expel the thugs! </p>
<p>     Stealing designer sunglasses from Louis Vuitton in China while our president Trump is visiting is NOT who we are as a nation, but it is definitely who they are, a bunch of knuckleheads, lowlifes, thugs, and [redacted] with attitude.     </p>
<p> Why would you ever let trash like that out of the country?? It aint no big deal! No other country in the world would take the crap that we do from a minority 13% of a population for the majority of crime and other A-Z Any other minority in the US seem to be able to make it along with a moral compass. Not to excuse slavery but for decade’s now [redacted] that wants to half way follow the program will make it. Its time to not hear any more excuses and crutching! </p>
<p> These three should not get a pass, just because of the color of their skin. </p>
<p> If they are attending your university on scholarships I strongly suggest they loose them. They can turn to their hero Colin Kaepernick, GQ’s Citizen of the Year for help. </p>
<p> What they did was not just stupid, it was ghetto and criminal, and we have no doubt that if there is another LA riot that they will be looting and vandalizing with their brothers. </p>
<p> Congratulations for continuing to show China what American atheltes exist in this country. China reads about the NFL players disregard to the American Flag and police that proudly give their life everyday to protect them, to this display of disrespect of China, America and the UCLA basketball program and school. </p>
<p>To some emailers, it was clear that the three players were experienced criminals ...</p>
<p> I can only assume they have never been held accountable because they can shoot a ball into a basket. </p>
<p> For these athletes to steal with the comfort level displayed showed they clearly had done this before. </p>
<p> Pampered puss ants who probably let their trouser snakes out on campus screwing anything they see! FUCK EM!! </p>
<p>... and that they weren’t good enough students to be at UCLA in the first place:</p>
<p> Two of the fellows could hardly speak english. </p>
<p> And did you notice that your student athletes had trouble reading their prepared statements? Shame on UCLA. </p>
<p> How did these students get into UCLA in the first place? I bet it probably wasn’t scholastics. … Dumber than a 2nd coat of paint! </p>
<p> I am embarrassed when your student athletics, like your arrested basketball players and even last year’s player [redacted] give interviews and use the word “ain’t ”. Children at age four learn that “ain’t” is not proper grammar and unacceptable. This example simply proves you have no regard for even teaching you student-athletics basic English grammar. Stop the nonsense. </p>
<p> It is an embarrassment to our country and your so called “education system” (what in the world are you teaching them anyway?) to have such reprobates representing us in foreign countries.  </p>
<p> For too long California taxpayers have been subsidizing free education for questionable athletes/students. ... There needs to be more vetting of these student athletes, background checks, and general review of their understanding of civics and ethics, before California Taxpayers continue to subsidize these people. </p>
<p> At a minimum, remove them from the basketball team. Of course this really means remove them from UCLA as they have no other use to be there since they can’t play basketball. </p>
<p> I’m sick of paying for a full SCHOLARSHIP for future wifebeater/ drug dealing, criminal scum who get away with stuff that have a normal person in jail for 20 years, but they are “Great ballplayers”, so they get to skate free.  </p>
<p>Some even suggested the players were indicative of everything wrong with American culture by comparing them to Harvey Weinstein and other famous people implicated in sexual harassment and assault cases:</p>
<p> [T]hey are toxic to the school and the sport just like serial sex predator Harvey Weinstein who is now a Hollywood pariah” </p>
<p> UCLA cannot stand by and turn a blind eye to this disgrace...it is akin to the many in the entertainment industry whom allowed Harvey Weinstein and his ilk to victimize individuals in the name of money and fame. … I must insist - no, demand - that these disgraceful, criminal thugs be permanently expelled from UCLA for their heinous behavior and criminal acts. </p>
<p> I’m particularly troubled by what appears to be the emerging excuse – that they’re young men, who made a very foolish mistake. To me, that’s a bit like Kevin Spacey coming out as gay when he’s charged with sexual misconduct. </p>
<p> Look at the news; Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Louis C.K. The time to say enough is enough is now. </p>
<p> For UCLA, if these young men are allowed to continue to be students there, at a time when entitlement is under such scrutiny because of the misdeeds in Washington, in Hollywood, news agencies, workplaces, academia and homes throughout the country, giving these players a pass adds insult to injury. Our moral and ethical scales are calibrated today to benefit the powerful over the ordinary. If they stay on campus, it may appear that UCLA is putting a thumb on the scale promoting star power at a time when we are at a moral crossroads. </p>
<p>And some who emailed Block said that he and UCLA should have left the players in China to face legal proceedings and potential jail time there:</p>
<p> I find it shameful that our President brought the thieving basketball players home. </p>
<p> Hopefully they will go to jail in China. </p>
<p> They rightfully deserved to be tried and punished under Chinese law. </p>
<p> They deserve to be in a Chinese prison. </p>
<p> Our country now owes a Communist country a favor. This is serious. </p>
<p> This is one of the few times we have disagreed with the actions of the President. In our opinion, the young men should have received Chinese legal proceedings and suffered the consequences. </p>
<p> Like a bubble gum chewer in China they should have been left to face a bamboo whip. </p>
<p>Only a handful of the emails sent to Block suggested that the appropriate punishment for the petty crimes the players committed in China wasn’t to ruin their entire lives. </p>
<p>“Chancellor Block,” one person wrote, “Please do not give up on these young UCLA men. Stick by them & help them grow.”</p>

<p>President Donald Trump may not have had a role in the release of three California college basketball players arrested in China.</p>
<p>ESPN reported Friday that the three University of California, Los Angeles basketball players, who were allegedly caught shoplifting in China, were already scheduled to return home by the time Chief of Staff John Kelly said the White House was getting involved.</p>
<p>LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley were in China for a game at the time of their arrests.</p>
<p>To recreate a timeline of the arrests, ESPN’s reporters spent three months conducting interviews with sources close to the team who were in China at the time of the incident.</p>
<p>“The situation was already resolved by the time we heard about Trump’s involvement,” one source told ESPN. “That’s not to take away from the fact that he got involved, but the players already had their passports back and their flights booked to go home Tuesday night when Gen. Kelly called the players.”</p>
<p>Earlier reports claimed the basketball players were released after Trump spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>Trump reportedly brought the issue up with Xi at a dinner during a visit to Beijing in November.</p>
<p>The incident sparked a feud between Trump and LiAngelo Ball’s father, LaVar Ball.</p>
<p>In an interview with CNN, Lavar said he’d rather thank Xi than Trump. He also expressed skepticism that Trump orchestrated his son’s release.</p>
<p>“Did he help the boys get out? I don’t know,” Ball said during the interview. “If I was going to thank somebody, I’d probably thank President Xi. He’s the president in China. Somebody can make a suggestion and somebody can do something.”</p>
<p>During their feud, Trump called Ball “very ungrateful” and claimed he was not taking his son’s shoplifting charges seriously enough.</p>

<p>LONDON (Reuters) - Roger Bannister, who has died aged 88, will live forever in the annals of athletics history as the first man to run a mile in under four minutes.</p>
<p>A statement from his family on Sunday said: “Sir Roger Bannister, died peacefully in Oxford on 3 March, aged 88, surrounded by his family who were as loved by him, as he was loved by them. ... He banked his treasure in the hearts of his friends.”</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Theresa May led the tributes to the former athlete, who later became one of Europe’s leading neurologists and was made a knight.</p>
<p>“Sir Roger Bannister was a great British sporting icon whose achievements were an inspiration to us all. He will be greatly missed,” she said on Twitter.</p>
<p>The record-breaking run was on the Oxford University track during a local athletics meeting with only a few spectators witnessing the Englishman’s destruction of the myth that no human being could run so fast.</p>
<p>Bannister made headlines around the world at the age of 25. His achievement opened the physical and psychological door for many other milers who have since beaten his time of three minutes 59.4 seconds.</p>
<p>Roger Gilbert Bannister, born in Harrow, a London suburb, on March 23, 1929, was a shy, gangling medical student who preferred to be an oarsman rather than a runner.</p>
<p>In 1946, when he went to Oxford, his great ambition was to row against Cambridge in the annual boat race on the Thames.</p>
<p>But Bannister, who stood 1.8 meters tall and weighed only 68 kilograms, was told he was too light to make a first-rate oarsman.</p>
<p>So he turned to running and his new ambition became to win the 1,500 meters at the Olympic Games in Helsinki in 1952.</p>
<p> Bannister started a five-year build-up and in 1947 at the age of 17 at Oxford ran his first mile race, finishing second in a time of just over five minutes. Later that year he won the mile for Oxford against Cambridge in an athletics meeting. LONE WOLF He asked for his name to be withdrawn from a list of 1948 Olympic possibles and continued his careful preparations for the 1952 games. But he managed only fourth place in the Helsinki Games 1,500 meters final. The press criticized him for faulty training methods. Bannister, nicknamed the“lone wolf miler” because he scorned coaches, had worked out his own training schedule to fit in with his studies. After Helsinki he became the forgotten man of athletics. But he had set his sights on the four-minute-mile — a challenge which had fascinated athletes and enthusiasts for years. </p>
<p> The world record was gradually being whittled down and a number of athletes were considered capable of crashing the four-minute barrier. Australia’s great miler, John Landy, recorded a four minutes 2.1 seconds mile in December 1952 and Bannister cut this to four minutes two seconds in June 1953. With American Wes Santee trying to lower his U.S. record of four minutes 2.4 seconds, the pressure was on and four-minute-mile fever was mounting. To Bannister, the challenge was not only to break the barrier but to be the first man to do so. The Oxford University versus Amateur Athletics Association fixture of May 6 was the first competition of the British season of 1954. Bannister, by then a medical student at a London hospital, set that day for his attempt. He enlisted the aid of his training companions and friends Chris Chataway and Chris Brasher, top athletes in their own right, as pacemakers. May 6 was cold, wet and windy - not ideal for a record-breaking attempt. Bannister thought of calling it off but after a short rain shower and with a drop in the wind, he said:“Right, I’ll try.” MEDICAL CAREER After a false start by pacemaker Brasher, the field of six got away. Bannister urged Brasher to go faster and at the halfway mark called on Chataway to take over from the tiring Brasher. Then 210 meters from the tape he pulled out from behind Chataway to immortalize himself as the first sub-four-minute miler. Seven weeks later Landy beat Bannister’s record with a mile in three minutes 57.9 seconds and in August, Bannister lowered his own time to three minutes 58.8 seconds, beating Landy at the Commonwealth Games in Vancouver, Canada. In August 1954, Bannister captured the European 1500 meters crown. Having qualified as a doctor, he retired from active athletics at the end of 1954 to pursue his medical career. By 1963 he was established in his profession as a consultant in nervous diseases at three hospitals and a year later became a member of Britain’s Advisory Sports Council. In 1971, aged 42 and a father of four, he was appointed by the government as the first chairman of the Executive Sports Council designed to finance and promote British sport. He was awarded a knighthood in 1975. He became president of the World Sports Council in 1976 and in 1977 was the first Briton to win West Germany’s Hans-Heinrich Siegbert prize for his services to sport. Oxford University elected him Master (head) of its Pembroke College in 1985. Bannister gave up his medical practice after a serious car accident and devoted himself to research. He became director of National Hospital for Nervous Diseases in London and edited a textbook on nervous system disorders. His prediction that the mile record would be progressively lowered was born out in subsequent years. In 1999, Moroccan Hiram El Guerrouj became the 13th record holder since Bannister, lowering the time to 3:43.13. (Editing by Sonya Hepinstall and Toby Davis) </p>

<p>Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman filed suit against the U.S. Olympic Committee for failing to take action to prevent former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor Larry Nassar from molesting hundreds of young athletes, according to news reports. </p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in California but announced Friday, accuses the committee of bungling its response to sexual abuse allegations against Nassar, who is now serving a long prison term for sex crimes. </p>
<p>“After all this time, they remain unwilling to conduct a full investigation, and without a solid understanding of how this happened, it is delusional to think sufficient changes can be implemented,” Raisman said in a statement, according to NBC. “I refuse to wait any longer for these organizations to do the right thing. It is my hope that the legal process will hold them accountable and enable the change that is so desperately needed.”</p>
<p>A USA Gymnastics trainer was sometimes present during treatment sessions where Nassar abused young athletes at the Karolyi Ranch, Raisman alleges in the suit, according to NBC News. </p>
<p>Raisman, in recent interviews, has accused the USOC of ignoring allegations against Nassar and threatening her not to tell how he molested her under the guise of treatment.</p>
<p>“I was told [by USA Gymnastics] to be quiet,” Raisman told ESPN in January. “And I think that when somebody in high power is telling you to be quiet, right when they realized you are abused, I think that that is a threat. USA Gymnastics just said, ‘We’re handling this. We got this. Like, stop asking us questions.’”</p>
<p>Raisman, a gold medalist who competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, was among more than 100 women who alleged Nassar sexually abused them. He pleaded guilty to child pornography and sexual assault charges and was sentenced to lengthy prison terms. </p>
<p>The USOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The group’s CEO, Scott Blackmun, resigned on Wednesday after a cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>“Under his leadership, USOC has focused nearly all its efforts on money and medals while the safety of our athletes has taken a back seat,” attorney John Manly, who represents many of Nassar’s victims, including Raisman, said in a statement.</p>

<p>A male gymnast alleges former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar sexually abused him during treatment for a shoulder injury ― the first male to publicly accuse the now-imprisoned serial predator.</p>
<p>Jacob Moore, a former member of the U.S. junior team and now a gymnast at University of Michigan, said in a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday in Michigan that Nassar molested him in 2016, when he was 16 years old, according to multiple news outlets. The suit was first reported by International Gymnast magazine on Thursday.</p>
<p>Moore says in his lawsuit that Nassar applied “acupuncture in his pubic area and in and around his genitalia” and “pulled down Moore’s pants, exposing his genitalia” to a young female gymnast also present in the room.</p>
<p>More than 100 women, including Olympic champion gymnasts, have alleged Nassar sexually abused them under the guise of treatment for decades, but Moore is the first male to come forward. Nassar pleaded guilty to child pornography and sexual assault charges in recent months and was sentenced to lengthy prison terms. </p>
<p>Moore’s older sister Kamerin said Nassar also abused her. Kamerin Moore mentioned her brother during Nassar’s sentencing hearing this year, recalling that she “watched him frantically search the Internet, trying to find some proof that the chi in his shoulder is somehow connected to his genitals.”</p>
<p>The siblings joined a federal lawsuit against Nassar, USA Gymnastics and Michigan State. The filing says “there is no known medical connection between shoulder pain which can be treated through acupuncture in the area of a male’s genitalia.”</p>
<p>Moore’s lawsuit adds to the litigation involving Nassar. The Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman filed suit against the U.S. Olympic Committee this week for failing to take action to prevent the abuse. </p>
<p>The USOC’s Scott Blackmun stepped down as CEO this week amid investigations into whether the organization’s officials knew about the allegations and attempted a cover-up. </p>
<p>CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified where Jacob Moore is a gymnast. It is the University of Michigan, not Michigan State University.</p>

<p>Barack Obama, the basketball-loving former president, said this week he’d play for the San Antonio Spurs if he were an All-Star free agent in the NBA. The declaration prompted a funny response on Wednesday from Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich.</p>
<p>At an MIT Sports Analytics Conference in Boston, Obama said that as a player he would seek out the five-time champion Spurs because they satisfy his checklist for ideal organizations.</p>
<p>“They’re smart, they’re well-run, they’re focused on team,” he said (listen in the sound clip below). “They treat everybody in the organization with respect, and that is the kind of organization that I want to be a part of. So I would say that over the last 15 years in basketball, San Antonio would be a great example of that.”</p>
<p>“If you look at what they’ve built,” he continued, “it’s just a smart, well-run operation with a good culture.” </p>
<p>Obama’s shoutout did not go unnoticed by the Spurs’ coach, who happens to be a critic of President Donald Trump and a socially conscious fellow. He also has a sense of humor.</p>
<p>“That’s very flattering,” Popovich said, according to the Bay Area News Group. “I’d have to do a background check on him, though, because I’ve heard some things he’s done in the past aren’t very good. I can’t remember where I heard that stuff, but I’d have to do a background check.”</p>

<p>Having decided it no longer kneads Papa John’s, the NFL has moved on to Pizza Hut as its official pizza sponsor, according to a statement the league made on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pizza Hut’s new status as sponsor was announced just one day after the league and Papa John’s released a joint statement saying the two had parted ways.</p>
<p>Pizza Hut and the NFL reached a multiyear agreement that will offer “exclusive marketing rights and designations that will connect the brand with the NFL and its teams, players, events, [and] partners,” the league said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Papa John’s has had a rocky few months. Founder John Schnatter, who supported Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, expressed his displeasure in November about NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality and systemic racial injustice. Schnatter claimed the league’s handling of the protests was responsible for Papa John’s softening sales.</p>
<p>That commentary resulted in bad publicity and still more poor sales for Papa John’s, ultimately leading to Schnatter’s resignation as CEO toward the end of last year. He is still the company’s chairman.</p>
<p>Twitter users (and many members of the NFL) have been particularly saucy about Wednesday’s news:</p>

<p>Scott Blackmun is stepping down from his post as CEO of the U.S. Olympic Committee after eight years, the organization said Wednesday in a statement.</p>
<p>The decision comes while Team USA’s governing body continues to face sharp questions over patterns of sexual abuse uncovered throughout the U.S. Olympic program. </p>
<p>USOC said the move was made out of consideration for Blackmun’s health. He is currently being treated for prostate cancer.</p>
<p>“Given Scott’s current health situation, we have mutually agreed it is in the best interest of both Scott and the USOC that we identify new leadership so that we can immediately address the urgent initiatives ahead of us,” USOC Chairman Larry Probst said in a statement provided to HuffPost.</p>
<p>Current board member Susanne Lyons will oversee day-to-day operations while a search is conducted for Blackmun’s replacement. The group is continuing to evaluate what steps it can take to prevent abuse of its athletes and said it intends to form an advisory committee of abuse survivors and advocates. </p>
<p>Observers have been particularly critical of the USOC’s relationship with former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, who was handed a prison sentence of at least 40 years in January for serial sexual misconduct. In the wake of the scandal, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) called for Blackmun’s resignation. Other Olympic groups, including USA Swimming, had also called for him and other USOC leaders to step down.</p>
<p>“The USOC is at a critical point in its history,” Probst said. “The important work that Scott started needs to continue and will require especially vigorous attention in light of Larry Nassar’s decades-long abuse of athletes affiliated with USA Gymnastics. We will be working with key stakeholders to help identify a permanent successor to Scott. In the meantime, I am confident that Susanne is the right person to help us navigate this critical transition period.”</p>
<p>Blackmun had earned praise for his efforts to repair relations between the USOC and the International Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>“Serving the USOC and its many stakeholders and working with our board, our professional staff and many others who support the Olympic and Paralympic movements has not only been immensely rewarding, it has been an honor and the highlight of my professional life,” Blackmun said in a statement.</p>
<p>California attorney Robert Allard, who represents USA Swimming abuse survivors, said in a statement Wednesday that Blackmum’s departure would be good for the USOC.</p>
<p>“Scott Blackmun refused to protect athletes from predator coaches even though he knew for decades that sexual abuse was a major problem with USOC National Governing Bodies,” Allard said. “His legacy, along with USA Swimming CEO Chuck Wielgus, will be that of a sexual abuse enabler. Moving forward, the culture that allowed sexual abuse to fester and thrive under Blackmun must be destroyed. We will not rest until all of those that have been part of the childhood sexual abuse problem for decades are removed from the USOC and its National Governing Bodies. Only then will young athletes truly be safe. With Blackmun now gone, it is imperative that the USOC put someone in charge who places the safety and welfare of athletes as its top priority.”</p>

<p>The 33-year-old athlete won a silver medal with Elana Meyers Taylor in the women’s bobsleigh event at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. But this week, she faced an online backlash over a selfie she took with senior White House adviser Ivanka Trump at the Games:</p>
<p>Gibbs snapped a shot of herself with President Donald Trump’s daughter and White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who were in South Korea as part of the U.S. delegation for the closing ceremony:</p>
<p>The post sparked accusations that Gibbs’ agreed with the White House’s policies. She also faced criticism for allowing Trump to wear her silver medal:</p>

<p>The whistleblower who exposed Russia’s Olympic doping scandal is firing back at a powerful oligarch who is financing a lawsuit against him in the United States, demanding that the businessman preserve documents that he believes may show Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government is secretly behind the litigation.</p>
<p>And in a letter addressed to Mikhail Prokhorov, the billionaire businessman who is also the owner of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, the lawyer for whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov threatens a countersuit aimed at exposing the Russian government’s efforts to harass and intimidate his client in the United States.</p>
<p>The letter by lawyer Jim Walden, a copy of which was provided to Yahoo News, adds to the intrigue surrounding a lawsuit that was filed against Rodchenkov last week in a New York state court by three Russian biathletes who were stripped of their 2014 Olympic medals as a result of the whistleblower’s allegations about Russian doping. The lawsuit accuses Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia’s antidoping laboratory, of defaming the biathletes and “destroying their careers.”</p>
<p>Letter To Mikhail Prokhorov</p>
<p>Scott Balber, the New York lawyer for the Russian athletes, has acknowledged that Prokhorov is helping to finance the lawsuit along with unnamed others. “I am not at liberty to identify anyone else other than Mr. Prokhorov,” Balber said in an email Monday, when asked who else was bankrolling the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Balber once represented Donald Trump in a $5 million lawsuit — filed in 2013 and later withdrawn — against comedian Bill Maher for likening Trump’s hair to an orangutan’s. He currently represents another Russian oligarch, Aras Agalarov, and his son Emin Agalarov — two key figures in the Trump-Russia investigation who helped arrange the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian operatives at which Trump campaign officials were promised derogatory information about Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>“Mr. Balber’s admission that unnamed ‘others’ are also financing this lawsuit is strange — raising the specter that the Kremlin itself might be acting through proxies here,” Walden said in a statement to Yahoo News. “Certainly, this could be problematic for all involved in this shady suit.”</p>
<p>In his letter to Prokhorov, Walden asks that all documents relating to the litigation be preserved, including any communications between the Brooklyn Nets owner and “any current or former Russian government officials, Russian law enforcement officers, officers or agents of the FSB [Russia’s domestic intelligence service] or representatives of the Russian Olympic Committee.”</p>
<p>Asked for comment, Balber called Walden’s letter “a publicity stunt” and said, “As far as I know, there is absolutely no Russian government role in the filing of the lawsuit. This appears to be complete fiction.” He added: “The sole purpose of this lawsuit is to clear the names of three hard-working, world-class Olympic athletes, and to obtain compensation for the economic loss they have suffered as a result of Mr. Rodchenkov’s false and defamatory statements.”</p>
<p>The legal sparring is the latest development in a complicated political and sporting saga that has been playing out since Rodchenkov fled Russia and went public with his account in 2016, describing what he portrayed as a vast and sophisticated scheme by Russia to provide banned drugs to the country’s athletes to boost their performance in the Olympic Games and other international sporting competitions — and to cheat the systems meant to catch them.</p>
<p>In numerous interviews and in the widely acclaimed Netflix documentary “Icarus,” Rodchenkov described how he worked with the FSB, the Russian spy agency formerly headed by Putin, and with Russia’s sports ministry to oversee a system in which sealed urine samples of athletes were routinely swapped after testing, allowing athletes to take banned substances to avoid detection. After the Sochi Olympics, Rodchenkov was awarded a prestigious Order of Friendship medal by Putin.</p>
<p>The allegations by Rodchenkov were confirmed by international investigators and led to the International Olympic Committee’s decision to bar Russia from sending a delegation to this year’s Winter Olympics in South Korea, although Russian athletes were allowed to participate as individuals. That decision was reaffirmed just this week by the Olympic Committee, which refused to let Russian athletes march under their own flag in the closing ceremony at the South Korea Olympics.</p>
<p>Since fleeing to the United States, Rodchenkov, now in the federal witness protection program, has provided key evidence to international investigators and Justice Department officials about potential violations of federal law by the Russians. In doing so, he has become virtually public enemy No. 1 to Putin’s government: Prosecutors in Russia have filed criminal charges against him, accusing him of drug trafficking, and Putin during his end of the year press conference last December suggested that Rodchenkov was being drugged and manipulated by U.S. intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>“What are [U.S. intelligence agencies] doing with him there?” Putin said at the December press conference. “Are they giving him some kind of substances so that he says what’s required?”</p>
<p>Shortly after Putin’s comments, Walden said he was warned by U.S. officials that Russian agents may be looking for Rodchenkov in the United States. Walden, a former federal prosecutor, said he is concerned that the lawsuit is in fact in furtherance of that effort — an attempt “to find him through judicial means.”</p>

<p>Russian Olympic bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva appeared in an Instagram video this month wearing a sweatshirt declaring “I don’t do doping.”</p>
<p>Three days later, she tested positive for a banned substance at the Pyeongchang Winter Games. Sergeeva denied taking the drug that triggered the positive result.</p>
<p>The video showing Sergeeva wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words, “I don’t do doping. I am ZASPORT,” a reference to the official clothing supplier to the Russian Olympic Committee, has since been deleted from Instagram, according to The Guardian.</p>
<p>The clip was reportedly posted to Instagram on Feb. 15 by Russia-based videographer Roman Bibishev. ABC News said the video was produced last year to promote the clothing brand.</p>
<p>Sergeeva was spotted in a similar shirt in Pyeongchang earlier this month. The Associated Press said she wore a white T-shirt with the words “I Don’t Do Doping” under her racing suit during a training session.</p>
<p>Sergeeva — who finished 12th in the two-woman bobsleigh event in Pyeongchang — tested positive for an angina medication with performance-enhancing properties on Feb. 18, the Russian bobsleigh federation announced on its Facebook page. She passed a drug test five days earlier.</p>
<p>Sergeeva denied taking the drug. The federation’s president, Alexander Zubkov, said the athlete had not been prescribed any medication.</p>
<p>Sergeeva was the second Russian athlete to fail a doping test at the Pyeongchang Games. Alexander Krushelnitsky, an Olympic curler, was forced to return his bronze medal last week after testing positive for meldonium, a potential performance-enhancing drug. </p>
<p>The International Olympic Committee banned Russia from the 2018 Winter Games over its state-backed doping program, but allowed a group of athletes to compete under the Olympic flag. </p>
<p>The IOC said it considered lifting the suspension for Sunday’s closing ceremony so OAR athletes could march under the Russian flag. In the end, however, the committee decided to keep the ban in place because of the two failed drug tests. </p>

<p>The 2018 Winter Olympics have concluded, and for the first time in two decades, women competing on Team USA brought home more medals than their male counterparts. </p>
<p>Team USA won a total of 23 medals in Pyeongchang, South Korea ― nine gold, eight silver and six bronze medals among them. Twelve of the 23 medals were won by women ― not including two that were achieved in mixed events (ice dancing and the team figure skating competition). When it came to the gold medals, five of the nine were won by women in history-making performances.</p>
<p>Cross-country skiers Kikkan Randall and Jessica Diggins won gold in the sprint freestyle, winning a medal in the event for Team USA for the first time since 1976 (and its first gold, to boot). Seventeen-year-old snowboarding sensation Chloe Kim won gold in the halfpipe, becoming the youngest ever gold medalist in the history of the event. The women’s hockey team won gold in the finals, beating longtime rival Canada and giving the team its first Olympic gold since the event debuted at the Winter Games in 1998. </p>
<p>Even when the women didn’t win gold, they still made history. Women athletes won three of six silver medals and four of six bronze medals. Alpine skier Lindsey Vonn took bronze in the downhill event to become the oldest Olympic female alpine medalist at the age of 33.</p>
<p>Team USA’s female athletes also surpassed their male teammates in medal count. As the Washington Post noted, only alpine skier Mikaela Shiffrin, snowboarder Jamie Anderson and ice dancing siblings Alex and Maia Shibutani won two medals at the games.</p>
<p>There were more men on Team USA, too. A total of 244 athletes made up America’s delegation ― the largest U.S. delegation in Winter Olympics history. There were 135 men and 109 women.</p>
<p>After the Associated Press obtained a medal tally projection chart created by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), it became clear that Team USA did not meet the organization’s expectations for awarded medals in Peyongchang. USOC projected Team USA would bring home a target of 37 medals, setting a minimum of 25 medals and a top-line expectation of 59.</p>

<p>Olympian Yuzuru Hanyu might’ve brought home a first-place medal in figure skating for Japan, but it turns out his photo poses are also gold. </p>
<p>A group of skaters and sweepers gathered for a selfie on the ice on Saturday after the Olympic figure skating exhibition gala, an event where athletes are given an opportunity to express themselves. Hanyu definitely showed his own flair in the photo, striking a pose in the air after being hoisted up by pair skater Ondřej Hotárek of Italy. </p>
<p>The result is a thing of beauty. </p>
<p>Naturally, people freaked out across social media at the extremely extra pose. Many praised fan favorite Hanyu for always bringing the fire, as well as Hotárek for being a true friend during selfie time. </p>
<p>And the selfie, taken by skater Misha Ge of Uzbekistan, really did turn out to be a masterpiece. </p>
<p>Hanyu, who has a fierce fanbase, has been known to charm hearts everywhere with his quirky personality and selflessness. After winning gold in the men’s singles competition, Hanyu ushered fellow Japanese skater Shoma Uno, the silver medalist, and Spain’s Javier Fernandez, the bronze medalist, onto his podium. The moment prompted praise from social media users who admired Hanyu’s good sportsmanship.</p>
<p>Hanyu is also loved for his own appreciation of lovable bear Winnie-The-Pooh. Back in 2010, the Olympian began to carry around a Winnie-The-Pooh tissue box and also ensured that a plushie would be placed on the side of rink that would “watch” him skate. Fans soon began to catch on to his love of the bear.</p>
<p>Fans toss him stuffed Poohs after he finishes his routines, as was widely seen at the Winter Games this year in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The skater typically donates the bears to the area’s children, because that’s the kinda guy he is. </p>
<p>Add all that with killer moves on the ice and incredible selfie skills and we have to ask ourselves, what’s not to love about Hanyu? </p>

<p>Prominent NBA agent Dan Fegan died Sunday in a car accident near Aspen, Colo.</p>
<p>Fegan, 56, was driving an SUV that was struck by a bus while trying to cross or merge onto Highway 82, Colorado State Trooper Gabe Easton told the Aspen Times.</p>
<p>Two passengers riding with Fegan, his 5-year-old son and a 29-year-old California woman, sustained serious injuries and were airlifted to a hospital in Denver, Easton told the newspaper.</p>
<p>The bus driver and the one passenger on board reportedly were unhurt. The Roaring Fork Transportation Authority operates the commuter bus, which was headed to Glenwood Springs, Colo.</p>
<p>RFTA chief executive officer Dan Blankenship told the Aspen Times, “The bus didn’t have time to avoid the collision, so it broadsided the other vehicle and knocked it into the median.”</p>
<p>Fegan’s family issued a statement via spokesman Terry Fahn: “Today we lost a great man, father, son and brother who always stood up not only for his clients but also for what he knew was right. We are all shocked and saddened by this tragic development and appreciate the outpouring of support. We ask for privacy at this difficult time.”</p>
<p>Fegan’s client list had included Dwight Howard, John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Nene and Ricky Rubio, according to the Aspen Times. The newspaper reported that last year he was fired from his agency, Independent Sports & Entertainment, and the sides subsequently were involved in a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Many colleagues and friends took to social media to remember Fegan:</p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee (IOC) dashed Russian athletes’ hopes of marching behind their national flag at the Winter Games on Sunday, deciding against immediately lifting Russia’s Olympic suspension after fresh doping violations.</p>
<p>Russians have been competing as neutral athletes at the Games, their Olympic status suspended, as IOC punishment for years of drug scandals involving allegations that Russia ran a systematic, state-backed drug-cheating program.</p>
<p>The IOC said two Russian doping violations during the Pyeongchang Games had marred an otherwise clean report card for the Russian delegation at the Games.</p>
<p>“This was hugely disappointing and, in addition to other considerations, prevented the IOC from even considering lifting the suspension for the closing ceremony,” IOC President Thomas Bach said in presenting the recommendation to IOC members.</p>
<p>Bach said Russia’s Olympic status would be restored automatically once it was confirmed there were no other doping violations by Russian athletes at Pyeongchang. It does not require any further decision by the IOC.</p>
<p>“That is an automatic decision,” he told reporters. “This is an objective condition ... and then the sanction is lifted.”</p>
<p>The suspended Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) said it hoped to return to the Olympic family in the coming days.</p>
<p>“We hope and really count on that in the next few days, the membership of the Russian Olympic Committee in the IOC will be completely restored,” it said in a statement.</p>
<p>“In light of the situation, we consider that the restoration of the rights of the ROC and all Russian athletes will be the main result of the Olympic Games that are ending today.”</p>
<p>Competition at the Winter Games concludes on Sunday and final drug testing results might not be known for several days or even weeks.</p>
<p>“I’m very disappointed,” said Elena Valbe, president of the Russian cross-country skiing federation.</p>
<p>“Some athletes stayed behind later with the hope that they would be walking under the Russian flag. I’ve heard athletes say that they were staying just because they wanted to walk with the flag and in our uniform.”</p>
<p>Former Olympic ice hockey champion Igor Larionov told Reuters it would be hard for Russian players to stand on the podium under the Olympic flag if they won the ice hockey gold medal in their final against Germany later on Sunday.</p>
<p>“Time needs to pass for the right to have the flag back, I think,” the Russian said. “It is difficult for me to understand how any figure skater, hockey player or skier can win gold and stand on the podium without their flag. It’s sad.</p>
<p>‘DROWNING MAN’</p>
<p>Russia’s Olympic delegation chief and its figure skating silver medalist, Evgenia Medvedeva, had made a last appeal to the IOC on Saturday for their suspension to be lifted, apologizing for the two doping violations during the Games.</p>
<p>Medal-winning curler Alexander Krushelnitsky and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva failed doping tests, angering a team that had been through extensive testing before and during the first days of Games competition without returning any positive results.</p>
<p>The lawyer for Grigory Rodchenkov, the former Russian doping laboratory director who turned whistleblower and helped expose the drugs scandal, said “cooler heads” at the IOC had prevailed and stopped Russia’s immediate Olympic return.</p>
<p>Rodchenkov currently lives in hiding in the United States.</p>
<p>“Thomas Bach was a drowning man, but finally cooler heads within the IOC threw him a life preserver,” Jim Walden said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Yet, in the decision, the IOC had the gall to claim Russia ‘respected’ its decision on December 5th to institute the suspension. The acrimony caused by Bach’s mismanagement should be his undoing,” Walden said.</p>
<p>At the Games, the Russians have been unable to wear national uniforms or have their anthem played at medal presentations.</p>
<p>Russian delegation chief Stanislav Pozdnyakov has said that the prospect of flying the flag at Sunday night’s closing ceremony meant more to his athletes than winning medals.</p>
<p>In December, the IOC had held out the prospect of lifting Russia’s suspension for the closing ceremony, on the condition its athletes met a strict code of conduct, including compliance with anti-doping rules and observance of athlete neutrality.</p>

<p>In what could easily be any Olympic athlete’s worst nightmare, an Austrian cross-country skier took a wrong turn during the Pyeongchang Winter Games on Sunday, destroying her chance of earning a medal.</p>
<p>Teresa Stadlober was in second place in Sunday’s 30-kilometer mass start, with just 7 kilometers (or around 4 miles) to go, when the 25-year-old mistakenly veered right on a downward slope as her competitors went left.</p>
<p>By the time she realized her mistake, Stadlober was in eighth place. She eventually crossed the finish line in ninth.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I really don’t know,” she later told The Associated Press. “I took the wrong way, and I did this twice. The second time I wasn’t sure anymore. I had a blackout. I don’t know why I took the wrong way.”</p>
<p>Stadlober said she cried and embraced her father at the finish line.</p>
<p>“He just said, ‘It was not your day today.’ But when you want to win a medal you have to know the track,” she added.</p>
<p>Norway’s Marit Bjoergen, who is now the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time, finished first to secure her 15th Olympic medal.</p>
<p>Bjoergen entered the 2018 Games with 10 medals and recently broke the previous record of 13 medals held by Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen. Sunday’s gold medal is her eighth of her Olympic career.</p>
<p>Bjoergen’s competitors finished almost two minutes behind her. In second, earning silver, was Krista Parmakoski of Finland, and in third, earning bronze, was Stina Nilsson of Sweden.</p>

<p>The 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, went out with a bang on Sunday, with its closing ceremony featuring an array of fireworks, light shows, roller-blading pandas, K-pop musicians and ― of course ―some of the world’s top athletes.</p>
<p>The vibrant, action-packed ceremony capped more than two weeks of competitions between 92 countries and more than 2,000 athletes. It also opened the doors to the next Winter Olympic Games, with the Olympic flag being lowered and handed to the mayor of Beijing, whose city will host the 2022 Games.</p>

<p>GANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - Russian ice hockey players sang their national anthem after clinching the gold medal in overtime against Germany at the Winter Games on Sunday, despite the anthem being banned as punishment for a years-long Russian doping scandal.</p>
<p>Russia, competing as neutral athletes at Pyeongchang, scored in overtime through Kirill Kaprizov for a 4-3 victory in one of the most surprising finals in the history of the Olympic men’s ice hockey tournament.</p>
<p>Later, at the medal ceremony, the winning team sang the Russian anthem over the sound of the Olympic anthem at the hockey arena, despite being barred by Olympic authorities from having their flag raised or anthem played.</p>
<p>With Germany’s Patrick Reimer off for high sticking midway through the extra period, the Olympic Athletes from Russia went on a four-on-three man advantage and Kaprizov one-timed a pass from Nikita Gusev past German goaltender Danny aus den Birken.</p>
<p>The OAR found themselves evenly matched by a German team that had surprised the hockey world by making it to their first Olympic final. The Germans won silver, their best finish ever in Olympic ice hockey.</p>
<p>Both teams scored twice in a back-and-forth third period with Nikita Gusev knotting the game with a short-handed goal with less than a minute to go to force the overtime period.</p>
<p>The Russians hit the ice hours after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided not to restore their delegation’s Olympic status, which would have enabled them to march under their flag at the closing ceremony later on Sunday. [nL4N1QF015]</p>
<p>As the OAR players received their gold medals on the ice, the Olympic flag was raised in place of the Russian flag and the Olympic anthem was played. But the players, arms around each other, sang the Russian anthem instead.</p>
<p>Singing the Russian anthem on the field of play is a violation of the IOC’s rules on neutrality, which were imposed on Russia as part of sanctions punishing the nation over systematic doping across many sports.</p>
<p>On paper the final shouldn’t have been a fair fight but the Germans skated evenly with the OAR.</p>
<p>Loaded with top home-grown talent from Russia’s Kontinental Hockey League, seen as the world’s second-best league after the NHL, and led by ex-NHL all stars Pavel Datsyuk and Ilya Kovalchuk, the OAR finally edged past a team that had punched above its weight.</p>
<p>Aside from Kaprizov with the game winner, Gusev was the other hero for the OAR, scoring two third-period goals and getting an assist to become the tournament’s points leader.</p>

<p>The 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, drew to a colorful conclusion on Sunday.</p>
<p>More than two weeks of fierce competition ended with an upbeat closing ceremony at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium, featuring artistic displays, fireworks, K-pop performances and dignitaries’ speeches.</p>
<p>In a poignant address, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach praised athletes from both Koreas who came together to compete in the women’s ice hockey event.</p>
<p>“You have shown how sport brings people together in our fragile world; you have shown how sport builds bridges,” Bach said. “The IOC will continue this Olympic dialogue, even after we extinguish the Olympic flame.”</p>
<p>Chinese President Xi Jinping also addressed the crowd via video message, in anticipation of Beijing hosting the Winter Olympics in 2022.</p>
<p>Olympians-turned-NBC analysts Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir will be part of NBC’s broadcast of the ceremony at 8 p.m. ET Sunday.</p>

<p>Tongan flag bearer and fan favorite Pita Taufatofua helped bring the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, to a close Sunday by baring his oiled torso one last time. </p>
<p>At first, Taufatofua ― whose chiseled appearance at the opening ceremony for the 2016 Summer Olympics set pulses racing and made him a viral sensation ― entered the closing festivities at the Winter Games bundled up in a heavy coat. (And who could blame him? Temperatures in Pyeongchang reportedly hovered around 31 degrees Fahrenheit Sunday.) </p>
<p>But rest assured: he soon doffed his seasonally appropriate duds, stripping down to little more than a red-and-black grass skirt, a pair of gloves and a smile. </p>
<p>“I’ve got to stay warm, get the flowers out, let people see the color of Polynesia,” he told USA Today. “What’s different here is that we’re no longer individual countries. We’re coming out together. That’s why I’m dressed the way I am. We’re all together, all the same.”</p>
<p>It’s been an eventful two weeks for Taufatofua, who competed as a cross-country skier. He didn’t exactly wow on the snow, finishing 114th out of 119 competitors in the 15K cross-country event. </p>
<p>The 34-year-old’s only goal, however, was not to finish last. He told NBC, “It’s not about winning medals for me. It’s about inspiring people to push themselves out of their comfort zone, to not fear failure, to fail and then laugh at it and then try again.”</p>
<p>It’s safe to say he succeeded. </p>

<p>U.S. Olympian Gus Kenworthy on Sunday issued a dig at Ivanka Trump colder than snow on which he skied during the Winter Games.</p>
<p>“So proud of all these people,” he tweeted as Team USA prepared to participate in the closing ceremony for the 2018 Olympics Pyeongchang, South Korea. Kenworthy, who came in 12th place in the slopestyle final, noted that “everyone has worked so hard to make it to the Olympics.”</p>
<p>“Well ... Everyone except Ivanka,” he quipped. “Honestly, tf is she doing here?”</p>
<p>The first daughter traveled to South Korea to head the U.S. delegation during the closing ceremony. She met and dined with South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Friday and greeted athletes from Team USA earlier on Sunday.</p>

<p>GANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - Japanese speed skater Nana Takagi unleashed a late surge of explosive speed to pass Dutchwoman Irene Schouten on the inside of the final corner and claim an Olympic gold medal in the women’s mass start at the Gangneung Oval on Saturday.</p>
<p>South Korean Kim Bo-reum slipped into the channel created by Takagi to win the silver medal 0.12 seconds behind the Japanese as Schouten settled for bronze.</p>
<p>Takagi, who won gold in the women’s team pursuit earlier this week, now has an individual Olympic title to add to her collection. </p>
<p>The 25-year-old celebrated by pumping her fists and waving to the crowd before making a lap of the stadium with the Japanese flag fluttering above her head.</p>
<p>“I‘m feeling very good,” Takagi told reporters. “Only lost focus on two laps, then I showed good acceleration. Then with 100 meters –- go. I‘m very happy. I focus on team pursuit and mass start.” </p>
<p>The race made its Olympic debut in South Korea and was given a touch of celebrity by the presence of Ivanka Trump, daughter of the U.S. President.</p>
<p>It was a tactical encounter, with 16 skaters simultaneously vying for an advantage on the track.</p>
<p>None of the trio who finished on the podium tried to win any of the three intermediate sprints, preferring instead to stay well back in the peloton and save their legs for the final push for a medal.</p>
<p>The first three to finish the race earn 60, 40 and 20 points respectively, while the top three skaters in each of the intermediate sprints earn five, three and one points to decide the classification places.</p>
<p>With two laps to go in the 16-lap race, the pack began to pick up speed, rapidly reeling in early pace-setter Saskia Alusalu of Estonia, who finished in fourth place after winning all three intermediate sprints.</p>
<p>Schouten had the lead going into the final corner but the Dutch skater misjudged her line slightly and was forced wide coming out, and Takagi stormed up the inside channel to capitalize on the mistake.</p>
<p>She crossed the line in a flurry of effort, her arms and legs pumping furiously to hold off Kim by a narrow margin.</p>
<p>Kim was crestfallen after finishing second. She made a deep bow to the crowd and took a lap around the track waving her country’s flag.</p>
<p>Kim and her team mate in the women’s team pursuit, Park Ji-woo, faced calls for them to be banned from the national team after they appeared to blame a team mate for their failure to reach the women’s team pursuit semi-finals this week.</p>
<p>“Because of me, it became controversial and I felt so sorry to everybody and so I bowed before the crowd,” Kim said.</p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Ester Ledecka became the first person in Winter Olympic history to win gold medals in both skiing and snowboarding after winning the snowboard parallel giant slalom on Saturday to go with her Alpine skiing super-G gold.</p>
<p>The Czech is only the fifth person to win gold in two different events at the Winter Olympics. Ledecka defeated Germany’s Selina Joerg in the final by 0.46 seconds to claim the gold.</p>
<p>Germany’s Theresia Ramona Hofmeister won the bronze medal race against Sochi bronze medalist Alena Zavarzina to complete the podium.</p>
<p>Zavarzina fell in both the semi-final and small final to open the door for the Germans. Ledecka dominated from the outset, setting the fastest time in qualifying and handling the pressure to win a historic double gold in Pyeongchang.</p>
<p>The two-time world champion’s achievement is the first athlete to win golds in two unrelated disciplines. The four others to win two different events competed in similar Nordic events. </p>

<p>The U.S. men’s Olympic curling team made history on Saturday after they bested Sweden to win the squad’s first ever gold medal. </p>
<p>After nine nail-biting rounds, the U.S. team took victory with a 10-7 score.</p>
<p>Team USA’s only previous medal was a bronze in the 2006 XX Olympic Winter Games in Italy. </p>
<p>This year’s win came after the team’s unlikely path to the finals. Earlier in the Games, they appeared headed for disappointment after losing four of their first six round-robin matches. But they managed to make a shocking comeback by winning the three remaining games to advance to the semi-finals, where they beat Canada–– a three-time gold medal-winning team.</p>
<p>“It’s a little surreal right now still, just coming off of where we were to where we are now,” American curler Tyler George said. “It feels like two different tournaments. One’s a dream and one’s a reality. Fortunately for us the winning streak is the reality, but we’re trying not to get too excited.” </p>
<p>Saturday was also vindication for a group once deemed the “Team of Rejects.” Skip John Shuster, whose five-point double takeout cinched the team’s win, had in 2014 been left out of elite curling program after his weak performance during the 2014 Sochi Games. The Wisconsinsite got in shape, lost weight and rallied other underdog players, including George, a Minnesota liquor store owner known for his horrifyingly decrepit shoes. </p>
<p>Team Shuster would go on to take first in two U.S. national championships as well as the November qualifying trials for the Pyeongchang Olympics.</p>
<p>It was a real Cinderella story.</p>

<p>An Instagram post by former Miami Dolphins player Jonathan Martin prompted a private Los Angeles area high school to shut down Friday as authorities worked to understand the somewhat cryptic message.</p>
<p>The LA Times reports police took Martin into custody for questioning Friday.</p>
<p>Harvard-Westlake School informed students it was closing “out of an abundance of caution” in an email Friday morning, adding, “we believe there is no imminent threat to our campuses or our school community.” </p>
<p>Martin, a graduate of the high school, shared a photo of a shotgun and a handful of shells on his Instagram story Friday morning, along with the caption, “When you’re a bully victim and a coward, your options are suicide or revenge.”</p>
<p>Martin tagged four people, including his former Dolphins teammates Richie Incognito and Mike Pouncey in the post, referencing both the high school and the Dolphins in text overlaying the image of the shotgun.</p>
<p>In 2013, Martin accused Incognito and Pouncey of aggressively bullying other players in the Dolphins locker room. A subsequent independent NFL investigation confirmed their misconduct, and Incognito was suspended for the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>After Martin suffered a back injury and retired from the league in 2015, he disclosed he has dealt with depression and has tried to kill himself several times. He detailed his struggle in a post on Facebook, saying he hoped it might help other struggling kids “know that they aren’t alone.”</p>
<p>“You let your demons go, knowing that, perhaps, sharing your story can help some other chubby, goofy, socially isolated, sensitive kid getting bullied in America who feels like no one in the world cares about them,” Martin wrote. “And let them know that they aren’t alone.″</p>

<p>It was an Olympic snafu. Literally.</p>
<p>Games officials in Pyeongchang, South Korea, inadvertently handed out the wrong medals to the U.S. men’s team champion curlers on Saturday morning, reports The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The squad scooped Team USA’s first ever Olympic gold in the sport against Sweden in a tense final.</p>
<p>But when athletes Joe Polo, John Landsteiner, Matt Hamilton, Tyler George and John Shuster came to receive their medals, all but Landsteiner were reportedly given ones engraved with the words “women’s curling gold.”</p>
<p>ESPN writer Alyssa Roenigk shared a photograph of the athletes analyzing the incorrect medals, above. Per USA Today, officials rectified the situation immediately.</p>
<p>Shuster, however, played down the blunder at the post-ceremony press conference. “It wasn’t a big deal at all, I promise,” he said.</p>
<p>Sweden and the Republic of Korea will contest the women’s team event final on Sunday. Hopefully the medals will be cleaned up by then.</p>

<p>A streaker at the Winter Olympics just wanted to bring “PEACE + LOVE” to the world.</p>

Sports">
<p>Documents and bank records obtained in discovery during the federal investigation into the underbelly of college basketball detail in meticulous fashion the expenditures of prominent former NBA agent Andy Miller, his former associate Christian Dawkins and his agency, ASM Sports. They include expense reports and balance sheets that list cash advances, as well as entertainment and travel expenses for high school and college prospects and their families.</p>
<p>Yahoo Sports viewed hundreds of pages of documents from the years-long probe that had federal authorities monitoring multiple targets and intercepting more than 4,000 calls across 330 days, providing a clear-eyed view into the pervasive nature of the game’s underground economy.</p>
<p>While three criminal cases tied to the investigation may take years to play out, the documents viewed by Yahoo revealed the extent of the potential NCAA ramifications from the case. The documents show an underground recruiting operation that could create NCAA rules issues – both current and retroactive – for at least 20 Division I basketball programs and more than 25 players.</p>
<p>The documents tie some of the biggest names and programs in the sport to activity that appears to violate the NCAA’s amateurism rules. This could end up casting a pall over the NCAA tournament because of eligibility issues. (NCAA officials declined a request for comment.) There’s potential impermissible benefits and preferential treatment for players and families of players at Duke, North Carolina, Texas, Kentucky, Michigan State, USC, Alabama and a host of other schools. The documents link some of the sport’s biggest current stars – Michigan State’s Miles Bridges, Alabama’s Collin Sexton and Duke’s Wendell Carter – to specific potential extra benefits for either the athletes or their family members. The amounts tied to players in the case range from basic meals to tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>An ASM balance sheet in the hands of federal investigators shows accounts through Dec. 31, 2015, with the subheading, “Loan to Players.” It listed several who were in high school or college as receiving four-figure and five-figure payments from ASM Sports. Among the largest listed loans:</p>
<p> Dennis Smith, who would go on to play at North Carolina State in 2016-17, received $43,500 according to the documents. Another document headed “Pina,” for ASM agent Stephen Pina, says Smith received a total of $73,500 in loans, and includes notes about “options to recoup the money” when Smith did not sign with ASM. Isaiah Whitehead, at the time a freshman at Seton Hall, received $26,136 according to the documents. The “Pina” document says Whitehead received $37,657 and was “setting up payment plan.” Whitehead signed with ASM but later left the agency for Roc Nation. Tim Quarterman, at the time a junior at LSU, received at least $16,000 according to the balance sheet. Diamond Stone, at the time a freshman at Maryland, received $14,303 according to the documents. A listing that refers to “BAM” for $12,000 is later identified in the documents as Edrice “Bam” Adebayo, who would go on to play at Kentucky in 2016-17. He did not sign with ASM. There’s a later reference to Adebayo that says he received $36,500. “Bad loan,” reads the document. Markelle Fultz, who would go on to play at Washington and become the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft, received $10,000 according to the documents. He did not sign with ASM. </p>
<p>Yahoo Sports reached out to officials at N.C. State, Seton Hall, Maryland, Kentucky and Washington. They all declined comment or did not return correspondence.</p>
<p>In addition, Dawkins filed expense reports seeking reimbursement for thousands of dollars that he reported as being paid to college and high school players and their families. Several players, families of players or handlers received more than $1,000 in payments from ASM Sports before turning professional:</p>
<p> Current USC player Bennie Boatwright and/or his father, Bennie Sr. (According to documents, they received at least $2,000.) Current USC player Chimezie Metu and/or adviser, Johnnie Parker. (According to documents, they received $2,000.) Current Texas player Eric Davis. (According to documents, he received $1,500.) Current South Carolina player Brian Bowen, who was ensnared in the initial federal investigation and started his career at Louisville last fall until the school withheld him from competition. His father, Brian Sr., also received money, according to the documents. (Dawkins’ expense reports also list more than $1,500 in plane tickets for Bowen, his father and his mother. He and his family received at least $7,000 in benefits, according to the documents.) Former Utah star Kyle Kuzma received at least $9,500 while in school, according to the documents. Former South Carolina player P.J. Dozier received at least $6,115 while in school, according to the documents. Former Xavier player Edmond Sumner and/or his father, Ernest. Documents show they received at least $7,000 in advances while Edmond was in school. Former Wichita State player Fred VanVleet. Documents show he received at least $1,000. Former Clemson player Jaron Blossomgame received a payment by Venmo while in school for $1,100 according to the documents. Apples Jones, the mother of former Kansas player Josh Jackson, received $2,700 according to documents. </p>
<p>Among those receiving hundreds of dollars in advances, according to Dawkins’ expense reports:</p>
<p> The mother of current Michigan State player Miles Bridges. </p>
<p>Additional Dawkins expense reports list meals and meetings with players or their families while in college or high school, and before they turned pro. While small amounts, these could be categorized as extra benefits under NCAA rules. It appears Dawkins paid for the meals, which could be an important distinction.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with meeting with an agent,” said Atlanta-based lawyer Stu Brown, a veteran of representing schools and coaches in NCAA compliance cases. “But then it becomes a question of who pays for the meal.”</p>
<p>Among the players and/or families who are listed as meeting with or having meals with Dawkins:</p>
<p> Current Alabama player Collin Sexton. Current Duke player Wendell Carter. Current Kentucky player Kevin Knox. Former North Carolina player Tony Bradley. Former Creighton player Justin Patton. Former Texas player Prince Ibeh. Former Notre Dame player Demetrius Jackson. Former Vanderbilt player Wade Baldwin. Former Virginia player Malcolm Brogdon. Former Iowa State player Monte Morris. </p>
<p>The breadth of names, schools and current players could offer a vexing test for both university compliance offices and the NCAA’s enforcement division. The sheer number of potential cases and varying degrees of potential violations are vast. There’s also an overriding factor of the ongoing criminal investigations. A complicating facet to it will be the NCAA’s potential inability to view key documents related to this case, because those details not in the criminal complaints are sealed under protective order. In terms of eligibility, the NCAA and the institution may be prohibited from interviewing people associated with the case because of the parallel criminal cases. (The initial onus to decide is almost always on the school in an eligibility case.)</p>
<p>No one is certain how the NCAA enforcement office would potentially handle the cases. The NCAA has been in constant contact with the feds but so far has had minimal direct involvement with the case, as they’ve been careful to respect the boundaries of the criminal investigations. The likely scenario, according to Brown, would be for the schools to assess the credibility of what’s in the documents and the severity of the potential violations.</p>
<p>“There’s potential for chaos, as it depends on the number of cases and the amount of information that’s released,” Brown said. “There could be inconsistency as a subset of chaos, as different schools may very validly assess the credibility of [the cases] differently.”</p>
<p>Yahoo did not view all of the documents in the three criminal cases tied to the investigation, but the records show an uncommon amount of detail for activities that have come under federal scrutiny.</p>
<p>For example, the expense reports have hundreds of lines like:</p>
<p>Feb. 10, 2016: “Flight for Brian Bowen mom. Flight for Brian Bowen. Flight for Brian Bowen dad.” They totaled more than $1,500.</p>
<p>Feb. 1, 2016: “Advance to Apples Jones (Josh Jackson) $1,700.”</p>
<p>Jan. 13, 2016: “ATM withdrawl: Advance to Fred Van Vleet $483.”</p>
<p>May 3, 2016: “Redwood Lodge. Lunch w/Miles Bridges Parents. $70.05.”</p>
<p>May 3, 2016: “ATM Withdrawl: Miles Bridges mom advance. $400”</p>
<p>According to the documents, Dawkins has dinners listed with plenty of boldface names in the sport – Tom Izzo, “Villanova coaches,” Fultz and the family of wayward five-star prospect Mitchell Robinson.</p>
<p>Along the way, a portrait emerges of the inner-workings of the office of Miller, who relinquished his NBA Players Association agent certification in the wake of the probe. Miller has yet to be charged in the case, and it’s widely believed he’s cooperating with the government. Dawkins’ lawyer, Steve Haney, told Yahoo Sports earlier in the week it was “utter hypocrisy” that an underling like Dawkins and the four assistant coaches were charged in the case and their superiors have gone unscathed. Haney added on Thursday night in an email statement: “These are college eligibility issues and agent licensing issues, not matters of national security that deserve this level of FBI involvement and taxpayer resources…..it has reached a degree of being ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Dawkins, the 24-year-old former business associate, was arrested on Sept. 26 and faces felony charges of wire fraud and bribery in two of the three criminal cases tied to the investigation. He ended up on federal wiretaps and, soon after the case broke in late September, his rise became a cautionary tale for how vulnerable top coaches and programs are to the agent world.</p>
<p>Yahoo Sports reached out to a dozen programs tied to the documents late Thursday. Only Xavier coach Chris Mack elected to release a statement. He said: “I have no relationship with Andy Miller or any of his associates. He plays no role in the recruitment of potential student athletes on Xavier’s behalf. Beyond that, our staff has never created a path for him to foster a relationship with any of our student-athletes while enrolled at Xavier. Any suggestion that I or anyone on my staff utilized Andy Miller to provide even the slightest of financial benefits to a Xavier student-athlete is grossly misinformed. We are prepared to cooperate with any and all investigations at any level.”</p>
<p>With an ongoing investigation, the chance looms there could be more charges and arrests. So far, four former assistant college basketball coaches have been arrested: Tony Bland of USC, Chuck Person of Auburn, Emanuel Richardson of Arizona and Lamont Evans of Oklahoma State. Six other assorted participants in the basketball underworld also have been arrested: Dawkins; former sneaker executives James Gatto and Merl Code; financial adviser Munish Sood; clothier and former referee Rashan Michel; and Florida AAU coach Brad Augustine. Charges against Augustine earlier were dismissed without explanation.</p>
<p>The case has also cost Louisville coach Rick Pitino his job, as the school parted ways with the Hall of Famer soon after the details of the program’s involvement in a six-figure agreement to sign five-star recruit Brian Bowen went public. Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich also was dismissed. At Auburn, two players and two members of the basketball support staff have been suspended. USC is withholding star point guard De’Anthony Melton from competition this season as well.</p>

<p>It’s no secret figure skater Mirai Nagasu is a hard worker. And the Olympian says the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. </p>
<p>Nagasu, who became the first American woman to land a triple axel at the Winter Games, spent much of her childhood at her parents’ sushi restaurant in Arcadia, California. She even slept in the establishment many nights as her parents worked.</p>
<p>During that time, she picked up some important life skills. </p>
<p>“I have a great work ethic because I’ve watched my parents work super hard,” the figure skater said, according to The Washington Post.</p>
<p>She added, “I’m also great at dishwashing because of the restaurant, as well!”</p>
<p>Nagasu’s father Kiyoto refused to take vacations, missing many of the skater’s competitions. The Los Angeles Times noted that Kiyoto refrained from taking time off since closing the restaurant would mean, his employees would go without pay. In fact, when the skater performed her historic triple axel, the parents were working the dinner rush at their restaurant, Kiyosuzu. Mirai’s jump helped propel Team USA to a bronze medal in skating. Ikuko, the skater’s mother, told USA Today Sports that they’d watch her performance later that night on DVR. </p>
<p>“Wow, can you believe it? Her child wins a medal and she’s still here — working, working,” patron Helen Lee told The Los Angeles Times. “It’s surprising, but I really respect that she stays with her responsibilities, running a business.”</p>
<p>The couple did make a rare exception to their work schedule for the later portion of their daughter’s performances in the Olympics. </p>
<p>“The business is important, but it is special to be able to watch Mirai,” Ikuko told USA Today. “We will shut the restaurant, go quickly, and come back quickly.”</p>
<p>The 24-year-old’s credits her parents’ drive as her inspiration. And it’s obvious to her team members too. Vincent Zhou, who became the first skater to land a quad lutz at the Olympics, described Nagasu as “the hardest worker I know.” </p>
<p>“She’ll do triple axels after triple axels until [coach Tom Zakrajsek] has to drag her off the ice,” he told The New York Times, commenting on her practices. “She’s incredible. She will skate 17,635 long programs and then do a short program every single day.”</p>
<p>From the restaurant to the ice rink, Mirai has come a long way thanks to her parents’ values. </p>
<p>“As a kid, she used to play in the back room,” Fiona Lee, another patron, told the Los Angeles Times. “When we saw her on TV, I said, ‘Oh my God, the little girl came out of the back room and is now in the Olympics.’” </p>

<p>Speedskaters from the Netherlands won’t be winning any medals for this performance at the Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>Sven Kramer, Jan Blokhuijsen, Patrick Roest and Koen Verweij tossed a gigantic replica of the bronze medal they won in the men’s team pursuit event into the crowd at Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Their ill-considered stunt at Holland Heineken House injured two women, and one was taken to hospital to be treated for a cut, reports NL Times.</p>
<p>RTL Nieuws shared footage of the incident online, and it’s now going viral:</p>
<p>Kramer, who won a gold medal in the men’s 5,000-meter speedskating event on the opening weekend of the games, later apologized in Korean on Twitter:</p>
<p>Yahoo News translated his message:</p>
<p> “Hello Korean fans. I apologize for the injury last night in the Heineken House representing our team. You came here to cheer the Netherlands’ ice sports team. But accidents happen and I apologize for this. And I hope for a quick recovery. And I will try my best to show a good performance. Thank you.”  </p>
<p>The incident was “very regrettable,” the four Netherlands speedskaters added in an official statement obtained by NL Times.</p>
<p>“Let it be clear that we obviously never intended to cause this,” it added. “We let them know that and in this way we also want to let the public know.”</p>
<p>Kramer is scheduled to compete in the men’s mass start event on Saturday.</p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea ― This year’s Winter Olympics has seen some of the most outspoken out gay athletes in history, many of whom have become media superstars for their performances on ice and snow but also for their deft handling of the public’s affection.</p>
<p>For Gus Kenworthy, his second Olympics has been as much a story about his performance as his newfound comfort with himself. Speaking to reporters at Canada’s Pride House in the Olympic Village, the 26-year-old skier told HuffPost that, despite missing the podium this time around, he felt he would leave these Games with his “head held higher” than his last showing four years ago.</p>
<p>“The last thing in the world you want is to have regrets,” Kenworthy said at the Pride House, which first launched at the Games in 2010. “For me getting to be out at this Games has been the most rewarding thing. But getting to leave here knowing that I actually brought myself to the Games, and I was true to myself and I gave it my all, I think I’m leaving with my head held higher than I did last time with a medal when I wasn’t being honest about who I was.”</p>
<p>Kenworthy won a silver medal during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, but he didn’t come out until a year later in an interview with ESPN. Coverage of Kenworthy has often centered on his sexuality, but the mantle is one he’s carried with grace to become one of the biggest celebrities of this year’s Games.</p>
<p>A quick kiss he shared with his boyfriend, actor Matthew Wilkas, before his qualifying run last weekend was broadcast by NBC to millions of viewers and spread like wildfire around social media. Kenworthy described the kiss as “so insignificant in the moment ... just a little kiss of good luck before my run.” Be he seemed to appreciate the momentum the broadcast carried.</p>
<p>“It just so happened that it was being filmed ... during the Olympics, beamed to television sets all over the world, and to parts of the world where it’s not OK, where it’s not accepted, including the country that we’re in right now,” Kenworthy said. “I think it was a really powerful statement in a way, but it was also not even intended to be. It was not something that had any premeditation to it.”</p>
<p>Another out athlete, Canadian figure skater Eric Radford, became the first openly gay man to win a gold medal at a Winter Olympics. He described his own coming out as a weight lifted, which allowed him to “express myself to a larger degree than I had before.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t quite realize it until after I came out, but when I did finally come out, I felt sort of a weight being lifted off my shoulders when I was on the ice performing,” Radford told HuffPost. “I felt a difference in how I just felt comfortable to express myself to a larger degree than I had before. When you accept yourself and you take pride in being yourself, you feel lighter, you feel lighter in all aspects of your life.”</p>
<p>Other out athletes have also quickly become household names across the U.S., including figure skater Adam Rippon, who has, appropriately, dubbed himself “America’s sweetheart.”</p>

<p>Period cramps can’t stop this Olympian. </p>
<p>Team USA figure skater Mirai Nagasu recently spoke to Cosmopolitan.com about how she deals with her period during competition. She said she’s really not too bothered by a little blood.</p>
<p>“I had my period on the way to the games,” she said. “It’s really not that big of a deal. You just stick a tampon up there. Periods can induce cramps for me, which I find exercise helps.”</p>
<p>Nagasu, who recently made history as the first American woman to land a triple axel at the Olympics, added that there’s always risk of a little leakage, but she can’t let that stop her: “You just have to pretend like it never happened.”</p>
<p>She’s not the first Olympian to get candid about competing while bleeding. During the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Chinese swimmer Fu Yuanhui told a reporter she was on her period while competing. </p>
<p> “My period came last night and I’m really tired right now,” she said at the time, bent over from menstrual cramps. “But this isn’t an excuse, I still did not swim as well as I should have.” Women are actual (bleeding) superheroes.  </p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Russian Olympic bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva has tested positive for a banned performance-enhancing drug, the Russian bobsleigh federation said in a statement on Friday.</p>

<p>Adam Rippon is now prepared to talk with Vice President Mike Pence.</p>
<p>But Pence probably shouldn’t expect any niceties from the figure skater, who helped the U.S. win bronze in the team event at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>Rippon and skier Gus Kenworthy were the only two openly gay men competing for Team USA at the games. (Speedskater Brittany Bowe is the only out American woman competing in the games.) Both Rippon and Kenworthy have previously called out Pence over his track record of intolerance toward the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>And in a joint interview with Kenworthy on Friday’s broadcast of “Today,” Rippon doubled down on his stance.</p>
<p>“Mike Pence doesn’t stand for anything that I was taught when I grew up,” Rippon told anchor Craig Melvin, before explaining it was “important if you’re given the platform to speak up for those who don’t have a voice.”</p>
<p>Rippon confirmed reports he’d turned down a telephone conversation with Pence before the games because he “needed to focus.”</p>
<p>But now, he said he was “totally” willing to chat. Rippon also denied that “too much” had been made over his feud with the vice president because “people still on some level have a problem.”</p>
<p>Kenworthy agreed, and noted how his televised kiss with boyfriend Matthew Wilkas during Sunday’s slopestyle event had sparked some negative reaction.</p>
<p>“Us also showing the same type of affection [as heterosexual couples] isn’t shoving it in your face, it’s just us existing,” he said, before joking that Rippon had been “mostly jealous” of the smooch.</p>
<p>“Hopefully people will see the reaction that we got, because I feel like we were so supported during this games and had so much love and encouragement, that it will provide people to want to come forward themselves,” Kenworthy added.</p>

<p>GANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - Russian teenager Alina Zagitova edged compatriot Evgenia Medvedeva with a stunning free skate on Friday that earned the Olympic Athletes from Russia a first gold at the Pyeongchang Games.</p>
<p>The 15-year-old, who lead Medvedeva by just over one point after a record-setting short program on Wednesday, effortlessly executed every element of her jump-packed free skate, earning 156.65 points for the performance and 239.57 points overall.</p>
<p>Skating to Don Quixote by composer Leon Minkus in a flashy red tutu, Zagitova held on for her opening jump, a triple Lutz, and went on to land another six triple jumps.</p>
<p>Medvedeva, who trains with Zagitova under the same coaches, won silver with a spectacular skate that put her 1.31 points behind Zagitova in the overall score.</p>
<p>Their performances in Pyeongchang reasserted the dominance of Russian women figure skaters on the international stage with third-placed Canadian Kaetlyn Osmond more than seven points behind Medvedeva on 231.02.</p>
<p>The Russian Olympic delegation in Pyeongchang last week said they were unhappy that Olympic gold had eluded Russian competitors in the first half of the Games, stressing it expected one of its female figure skaters to end the drought.</p>
<p>Russians in Pyeongchang are competing as neutrals, a penalty imposed over allegations that the nation had systematically manipulated anti-doping testing at the 2014 Sochi Games.</p>
<p>Some of Russia’s top athletes were not cleared to compete by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</p>
<p>With Friday’s figure skating medals, the OAR now have one gold, five silver and eight bronze medals and are currently 15th in the medals table with two days of competition remaining.</p>
<p>A few months ago, it seemed that Medvedeva would easily clinch Olympic gold as she repeatedly extended her winning streak.</p>
<p>But the 18-year-old suffered a foot fracture that sidelined her from the Grand Prix Final in December and gave Zagitova, competing in her first senior season, a chance to fill the void left by her absence.</p>
<p>Zagitova last month spoiled Medvedeva’s injury comeback at the European championships in Moscow, handing her a first defeat since November 2015 and establishing herself as a Pyeongchang gold medal favorite.</p>
<p>Osmond, who was third after the short program, stepped out of her opening triple Lutz but recovered to cleanly complete her free skate.</p>
<p>Italy’s Carolina Kostner, who was competing in her fourth and final Olympics and was sixth after the short program, stepped out of her triple flip and put her hand down, finishing fifth overall.</p>

<p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian curlers Alexander Krushelnitsky and Anastasia Bryzgalova will hand back the Olympic medals they won in Pyeongchang, the Russian news agency TASS reported, citing a Russian curling Federation spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Krushelnitsky, who won bronze in Pyeongchang with his wife Bryzgalova in mixed doubles curling, tested positive for meldonium, a drug that can aid endurance.</p>
<p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport said on Wednesday it would hear a case against Krushelnitsky on Thursday.</p>

<p>The U.S. women’s Olympic hockey team on Thursday eked out a victory over Canada after a tie score forced the game into a thrilling overtime.</p>
<p>The Canada team had been ahead 2-1 towards the end of the third period when American player Monique Lamoureux-Morando scored on a breakaway.</p>
<p>The game went into a 20-minute overtime, during which no players from either team scored thanks to quick reflexes from Canada goalie Shannon Szabados and U.S. goalie Maddie Rooney. Then, the five round shootout― a first for Olympic women’s hockey, according to the AP― also ended in a tie.</p>
<p>Finally, in the first extra round of shootouts, American Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson scored one over her Canadian rival, giving the team its the first Olympic gold since the women’s competition debuted in 1998. The Canadian team had won it every year since then.</p>
<p>ESPN’s T.J. Quinn called the competition “one of the greatest games I’ve ever seen, any sport.” You can watch some of the highlights here. </p>

<p>By Simon Evans</p>
<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Switzerland’s Michelle Gisin won the women’s combined at the Pyeongchang Games on Thursday with American Mikaela Shiffrin taking silver while another Swiss Wendy Holdener won bronze.</p>
<p>Lindsey Vonn, who had led after the downhill section, was the last skiier to compete but did not finish her slalom run leaving the 24-year-old Gisin to take her first Olympic medal. The event was likely Vonn’s last Olympics run. </p>
<p>“It’s sad,” she said on Tuesday after placing third in the women’s alpine downhill final. “This is my last downhill. I wish I could keep going. I have so much fun. I love what I do. My body probably just can’t take another four years.”</p>
<p>Gisin’s victory, with a combined time of two minutes 20.90, nearly a second ahead of pre-race favorite Shiffrin, completed a rare Olympic double for her family.</p>
<p>Gisin’s elder sister Dominique won gold in the downhill in Sochi four years ago.</p>
<p>The result leaves Shiffrin with two medals from these Games after her gold in giant slalom.</p>
<p>Holdener produced the fastest slalom run of the day with 40.23 and held on to bronze with Norwegian Ragnhild Mowinckel struggling in the technical element and then Vonn skiing out early in her effort.</p>

<p>Two skiers suffered terrifying crashes during the final run of the men’s ski halfpipe event at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Thursday. </p>
<p>Kevin Rolland of France, who won bronze in the same event in Sochi, Russia, in 2014, hit the top of the lip of the halfpipe, causing his legs to split wide as he fell backward to the bottom. </p>
<p>Paramedics rushed to the center of the halfpipe to take Rolland off the course on a stretcher, but the athlete got up and skied down the rest of the pipe on his own.</p>
<p>According to The Guardian’s live blog, Rolland was “making a frightening moaning noise in the middle of the pipe that we can only hope is simply out of frustration and not pain.”</p>
<p>Soon after, Torin Yater-Wallace of the U.S., whose path to the Olympic Games has been plagued by injuries, also crashed into the lip of the pipe. The 22-year-old slid down the side of the halfpipe as one of his skis popped off. He lay on the ground for a few moments before getting up, looking somewhat disoriented, and skiing to the bottom of the course. </p>
<p>According to The Associated Press, Yater-Wallace’s path to Pyeongchang has been filled with challenges. In 2015, he spent 10 days in a medically induced paralysis state due to a life-threatening infection.</p>
<p>“There have been broken ribs, moves from house to house in Aspen, Colorado, time the family spent on food stamps, all in the name of advancing a career that Yater-Wallace hoped might end up at the Winter X Games or the Olympics,” AP’s Pat Graham wrote.</p>
<p>The U.S. Ski and Snowboard team tweeted that Wallace was OK after the crash.</p>

<p>Kim has wowed audiences worldwide with her talent, and she won fans early in the Games with her hilarious tweets about comfort food, including one she sent just before her gold medal performance, lamenting she was “hangry.”</p>
<p>Sports Illustrated’s Michael Rosenberg wrote that Kim was a “phenomenon” and that she wasn’t the only one at the 2018 Winter Olympics. “Wherever you went in PyeongChang, you found an extraordinarily young gold medalist.

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Canada’s Christopher Delbosco suffered a possible broken pelvis and Terence Tchiknavorian of France was taken to hospital with a suspected fractured shin after a crash-ridden round of the men’s ski cross heats on Wednesday.</p>
<p>An Austrian team official said Christoph Wahrstoetter had suffered a concussion after colliding with Sweden’s Erik Mobaerg in heat six.</p>
<p>Mobaerg was able to walk away from the crash and was seen talking to reporters after the event. Delbosco received lengthy medical treatment after landing on his back, but was seen raising his arms as he was carried off the course on a stretcher.</p>
<p>He was taken to hospital for treatment after injuring his pelvis.</p>
<p>The Canadian press attache had earlier said Delbosco suffered a broken pelvis but team officials later said they wanted to wait on further tests before confirming the severity of the injury.</p>
<p>Tchiknavorian’s team mate Jean Frederic Chapuis told reporters that the 25-year-old had suffered a broken leg but this wasn’t confirmed by the press attache, who stressed on waiting for official confirmation from the team doctor.</p>
<p>Despite the three injuries, as well as a collision between Kevin Drury and Sergey Ridzik in the final, the athletes refused to blame the course and said injuries were part of the sport.</p>
<p>“Throughout the season you see a lot of crashes,” said Drury. “It is part of the sport. It is the bad part of the sport but it is kind of what happens.”</p>
<p>“It is sad (these injuries) are happening,” added Slovenia’s Filip Flisar, who went out in the semi-finals. “There is not a lot you can do because the specifics of the sport itself are extreme.”</p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Kikkan Randall and Jessica Diggins delivered the first Olympic cross-country medal for the United States since 1976 with a stunning victory in a thrilling finish to the women’s team sprint relay on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Diggins held off the challenge of Sweden’s Stina Nilsson in a furious sprint for the line to win gold and Norway’s Marit Bjoergen became the most successful winter Olympian of all time with 14 medals after taking bronze with Maiken Caspersen Falla.</p>
<p>“It feels unreal, I can’t believe it just happened,” Diggins told reporters.</p>
<p>“In the final stretch I was just thinking, ‘Go, go, go, I‘m giving it everything I had and I’ve got someone who I really love and care about waiting for me at the finishing line and I just want to make her proud’,” she said of Randall.</p>
<p>The Americans had not celebrated a medal in cross-country since Bill Koch took silver in the 30km race in Innsbruck more than 40 years ago.</p>
<p>“I had so much adrenaline as she was coming down, but if there’s anybody I’d have 100 percent faith in coming down that finishing stretch as fast as possible, it’s Jessie,” said the 35-year-old Randall who is competing in her fifth Olympics.</p>
<p>“So that was just a wonderful feeling to take it all in and watch it happen.”</p>
<p>Sweden and Norway were hot favorites for yet another gold medal in women’s cross-country skiing and the Nordic nations were at the head of the pack for almost the entire race.</p>
<p>With the racers taking turns to speed around the 1,176-meter long track, Randall and Diggins fought to stay in touch with the leaders as the rest of the pack fell away after the halfway point.</p>
<p>Randall kept the Americans in the hunt on her final leg, handing over to Diggins for the sixth and final lap which was raced at a furious pace as the lead changed hands several times.</p>
<p>Well set up by team mate Charlotte Kalla, Sweden’s Nilsson and Norway’s Falla clashed as they approached the stadium for the final time, and skis touched again as Diggins sought a lane from which to make her push for glory.</p>
<p>She passed Falla and set her sights on leader Nilsson, who won gold in the individual sprint, as they rounded the final bend to set up an electrifying finish.</p>
<p>Diggins surged past and thrust her ski across the line 0.19 seconds ahead of Nilsson.</p>
<p>“I am very proud of our performance, I was really digging deep today to get the power over the last 100 meters, but today USA was too strong and I really think they deserve the gold medal,” Nilsson said.</p>

<p>In what will likely be her last Olympic downhill race, U.S. alpine skier Lindsey Vonn won the bronze medal in her best event. At the age of 33, Vonn made history Wednesday in Pyeongchang, South Korea, as the oldest Olympic female alpine medalist.</p>
<p>Vonn grew emotional at the end of the race, breaking down as she told reporters that she was sad it was her final downhill race. </p>
<p>“I wish I could keep going; I had so much fun; I love what I do,” she said. “My body just probably can’t take another four years.”</p>
<p>World Champion Sofia Goggia of Italy won gold, while Ragnhild Mowinckel of Norway took silver. Goggia became the first female downhill Olympic gold medalist in Italy’s history.</p>
<p>Vonn won gold in the same event in the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, though she missed the Sochi Games due to injury. NBC broadcasters repeatedly mentioned that the skier had been waiting eight years for a roughly 100-second race.</p>
<p>“I skied a great race today,” Vonn told reporters afterward. “Sofia just skied better than I did ... I have no regrets; I’m really happy; I’m especially happy and proud of my teammates.” She also joked that she was optimistic she’d medal, as there were no snowboarders in the race.</p>
<p>Vonn was referring to Saturday’s super-G event, where she failed to medal after she slid out on the final turn of the course. Instead, 22-year-old Ester Ledecká of the Czech Republic, who is primarily a snowboarder, won a surprise gold.</p>
<p>Vonn was considered the favorite to win Wednesday. She placed well in her training runs and positioned herself within reach of the podium for the final. </p>
<p>The star athlete chose to ski seventh in the lineup to ensure she raced after 25-year-old Goggia, her rival and friend. NBC reporter Steve Porino said Vonn wanted to eliminate the possibility that Goggia would be able to observe Vonn’s run and gain last-minute inspiration for her own run.</p>
<p>The night before the race, Vonn shared an emotional and inspiring message that it would likely be her last downhill at the Olympics, and she’d give it her all. </p>
<p>“I know everyone expects a lot from me, and I expect even more of myself,” she wrote. “However there’s only one thing I can guarantee; I will give everything I have tomorrow. Count on it.”</p>
<p>The fan favorite made headlines ahead of the Pyeongchang Games when she said last month that she was representing the people of the United States, but not President Donald Trump. She also said she wouldn’t go to the White House if she were invited after the Olympic Games. </p>

<p>GANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - Petr Koukal scored the only goal in the shootout to give the Czech Republic a 3-2 win over the United States on Wednesday to become the first team through to the semi-finals of the men’s Olympic ice hockey tournament.</p>
<p>Koukal, the second Czech to shoot, deked around U.S. netminder Ryan Zapolski for the only goal of the shootout as the Americans could not get a puck past Pavel Francouz, who stopped all five shots.</p>
<p>The Czechs await the winner of Norway and Olympic Athletes of Russia who play later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>With the scored locked at 2-2 late in the third period, Brian O’Neill had a chance to give the U.S the lead when his wrist shot clanged off the post.</p>
<p>Then with 1:20 left in regulation the U.S. were handed another opportunity when Vojtech Mozik was sent off for slashing but the Americans could not convert the man advantage sending the contest to overtime.</p>
<p>It was nail-biting end to a seesaw quarter-final that saw plenty of end to end action.</p>
<p>After killing off a powerplay the United States drew first blood in the first period when Ryan Donato rifled a shot past a badly screened Francouz.</p>
<p>The goal was Donato’s fifth of the tournament eclipsing his father Ted’s four goals from the 1992 Albertville Winter Games.</p>
<p>The Czechs answered late in the period when Jan Kolar’s rocket from the point sailed past Zapolski.</p>
<p>Midway through the second the Czechs took the lead on another long range strike with Tomas Kundratek loading up from just inside the blueline but the Americans came right back two minutes later with a shorthanded goal from Jim Slater. </p>

<p>By Soyoung Kim and Elaine Lies</p>
<p>GANGNEUNG, South Korea (Reuters) - Alina Zagitova took the lead in women’s singles figure skating on Wednesday with a brilliant free skate that set a world record, giving her nation a strong shot at its first gold of the Pyeongchang Games.</p>
<p>The Olympic Athlete from Russia’s routine to “Black Swan” featured three triple jumps, including a triple Lutz and triple loop combination and was awarded 82.92 points.</p>
<p>“I’m happy to have a clean skate and really grateful to myself for that,” the 15-year-old said via a translator.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it was my best, I can be better. My next goal is to of course have a clean free skate.”</p>
<p>Her compatriot Evgenia Medvedeva, who had set a new world record before Zagitova broke it some 15 minutes later, was second on 81.61 points.</p>
<p>Canada’s Kaetlyn Osmond was third on 78.87.</p>
<p>“It was not my best but it was okay,” Medvedeva told reporters. “Every day I see Alina working so hard and she did her best today,” added the 18-year-old who trains with the same coach as her compatriot.</p>
<p>Medvedeva was for a long time favored to top the podium at Pyeongchang but suffered a broken foot that ate into her training time and lost for the first time in two and half years in January when she was beaten by Zagitova at the European Championships.</p>
<p>“I was calm performing the routine, the game will go on. I am happy with setting a new personal record,” said Medvedeva.</p>
<p>“I’m good friends with Alina, I practice together with her and talk with her all the time.”</p>
<p>Japanese skaters Satoko Miyahara and Kaori Sakamoto were in fourth and fifth.</p>
<p>America’s Mirai Nagasu had come into the event with high expectations but fell on her triple Axel after becoming the first American to nail it in the Olympics during the team competition and bobbled her triple loop to end up in ninth.</p>
<p>“Today wasn’t my day, but my triple triple was still pretty good so I’m happy about that,” Nagasu said.</p>

<p>Team USA’s speed skating uniform at the Winter Olympics is getting criticism for the crotch design.</p>
<p>It seems that some people watching the American athletes on the ice in Pyeongchang, South Korea, are having trouble focusing on much else:</p>
<p>Under Armour, the apparel company that has worked with the national team on the suits for the last four years, said the crotch features a “friction guard” that reduces friction and improves skaters’ performance.</p>
<p>“The 2014 UA skin had one panel instead of two, but in testing the new skin, the addition of a second panel reduced friction even more ― by 60 percent,” Under Armour told InStyle via a statement.</p>
<p>And the color of the crotch material couldn’t have been any different:</p>
<p> “We tested a multitude of friction guard materials to find the material that reduces friction the most. Altering the color or using a material that comes in a different color would have rendered it considerably less effective.” Under Armour  </p>

<p>A Sports Illustrated report detailing widespread workplace sexual misconduct in the Dallas Mavericks organization that involved its former CEO is sending shock waves through the league and drawing sharp criticism.</p>
<p>The exposé, published on Tuesday, alleges that the team’s former president and CEO, Terdema Ussery, was widely known as a “serial sexual harasser.” He once asked a female employee if her weekend plans included getting “gang-banged,” the magazine reported.</p>
<p>“Actually, I’m going to the movies with friends,” the woman reportedly replied, to which Ussery then reportedly told her, “you’re definitely getting gang-banged.”</p>
<p>Ussery was part of a larger Mavericks culture of abuse that included sexual harassment and assault, as well as domestic violence, and retaliation against those who tried to report offenses, the magazine reported. Ussery denies all the allegations. </p>
<p>“It was a real life Animal House,” one former employee told the publication. “And I only say “was” because I’m not there anymore. I’m sure it’s still going on.”</p>
<p>You can read the full Sports Illustrated report here.</p>
<p>None of the team’s athletes are accused of misconduct, nor is the team owner, billionaire Mark Cuban. But Sports Illustrated suggested that Cuban, who told the publication he was “embarrassed ... that it happened under my ownership,” let some behavior slide. Cuban denied knowledge of the behavior, telling the magazine,“this is all new to me .... the only awareness I have is because I heard you guys were looking into some thing.”</p>
<p>After a flurry of complaints, the Mavericks in 1998 launched an internal investigation into Ussery, but it had no major repercussions on his career. He remained with the team for almost two decades, leaving in 2015 for a job at Under Armour, where he resigned following accusations of harassment.</p>
<p>The Mavericks responded to the article with a statement distancing the organization from Ussery.</p>
<p>“This individual left the employment of the Mavericks nearly three years ago and the Mavericks have only learned of the scope of these complaints in the past days,” the Mavericks said.</p>
<p>The organization said it ordered “thorough and independent investigation” of the charges. It also said that that it fired one employee who had “misled the organization about a prior domestic violence incident.”</p>
<p>“There is no room for such conduct in the Mavericks’ workplace — or any workplace,” the statement said.</p>

<p>We know who’s wearing the pants in these Olympics games. If you could win gold just for clothing, Norway’s curling team would be the one to beat.</p>
<p>While other teams stuck with more boring monochromatic slacks, Norway’s team donned a particularly colorful set of pants during the 2018 Olympic Winter Games. And they even wore different pairs for each event.</p>
<p>Check out their colorful attire below:</p>

<p>The dream of an Olympic medal came to a crashing end Tuesday for U.S. ice dancing team Madison Chock and Evan Bates.</p>
<p>The duo, who stood in seventh place heading into the medal competition, experienced what NBC commentators described as a “heartbreaking” and “obvious” mistake during their program, both falling in the middle of a turn element. </p>
<p>“That’s such an obvious mistake,” NBC’s Terry Gannon said. “It’s just kind of a given that you don’t fall if you’re going to challenge one of the top spots.” He later added, “I don’t know how you carry on with the rest of the program because you know your chance for a medal is gone.”</p>
<p>Midway through the free dance, Chock and Bates moved into a turn element when their skates clicked together at the very beginning of the spin, causing the athletes to tumble to the ice. As a result, the error cost them significant points on their technical score and ended their chance of placing on the podium.</p>
<p>Chock and Bates were one of three U.S. ice dancing teams competing for a medal on Tuesday, and they were separated by only a few points from U.S. fan-favorites Maia and Alex Shibutani following Monday’s competition. Right before Chock and Bates took the ice Monday, Chock said, her old foot injury flared up, which she said was “kind of traumatic.” Still, they skated a stellar program, which brought high expectations for Tuesday.</p>
<p>Though it was unlikely they’d contend for gold, Chock and Bates were within reach of bronze before the fall.</p>
<p>The duo made a quick recovery and finished their graceful program to John Lennon’s “Imagine” without error. The crowd cheered them on as they moved on from the mistake.</p>
<p>Chock later tweeted her gratitude to fans for their support, noting they received tons of kind messages after their performance. </p>

<p>Any way you sweep it, the doping scandal surrounding Russian Olympic curler Alexander Krushelnitsky is bizarre.</p>
<p>After a podium appearance at the 2018 Winter Olympics, he reportedly tested positive for meldonium, a drug that would have been crazy for any curler to take before an international competition. For one, the drug’s purported benefits ― increased blood flow and faster recovery after a workout ― don’t seem particularly necessary for curling, a sport in which some athletes were known to take smoke breaks mid-match.</p>
<p>Plus, Krushelnitsky, his managers and his doctors knew what the rest of the world knew going into the Winter Games: There’s a microscope on Russia because of revelations about its state-sponsored doping regime and its athletes’ taste for meldonium in particular. Tennis star Maria Sharapova admitted to taking meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open, which earned her a 15-month ban, and enough members of Russia’s under-18 hockey squad tested positive for the stuff that the team was replaced en masse before the 2016 world championships.</p>
<p>Perhaps most peculiar, though, is the fact that meldonium, a heart drug, was banned in the first place. The drug’s performance-enhancing properties have not actually been scientifically confirmed. But they never had to be, because Russian athletes were taking a lot of it, and that was enough to get the World Anti-Doping Agency’s attention.</p>
<p>WADA took aim at meldonium, developed in 1970 in Latvia, when it noticed that a number of professional athletes in the old Eastern Bloc were using it. A study of the 2015 European Games, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found a “high prevalence of meldonium use by athletes.” It found that 13 medal winners were on meldonium at the time, and 66 of 762 athletes tested positive for it.</p>
<p>Russians, meanwhile, were crazy for it. A study by the country’s anti-doping agency found that 17 percent of samples taken from 4,316 Russian athletes between October 2014 and February 2015 had traces of meldonium, according to the Times. When researchers looked at rugby players, that number skyrocketed to 53 percent.</p>
<p>WADA spent only a year monitoring the drug before banning it on Jan. 1, 2016. (By comparison, it’s taken years to ban other substances ― some drugs, like caffeine, sit on the monitoring list indefinitely.) After meldonium was banned, athletes largely from Eastern European countries failed more than 170 doping tests due to the drug, including Sharapova.</p>
<p>Dr. Olivier Rabin, WADA’s science director, noted that after the Sharapova scandal, the group banned meldonium in part because everyone was doing it.</p>
<p>“For meldonium, it quickly came to our attention that there were clear patterns of use by entire teams, which usually suggests a drug isn’t being taken for medical purposes,” he told NPR in 2016. “How could every member of a team need the same medical treatment?”</p>
<p>But although Rabin says there are studies suggesting the drug had a “potential performance-enhancing benefit,” there isn’t any preponderance of evidence that this is true. In fact, one study Rabin referred to actually states that “The evidence to demonstrate any performance enhancing effects of meldonium in the athlete population is limited.”</p>
<p>Of course, this didn’t need to be about performance enhancement. Before banning a drug, WADA also looks at other criteria, including health risks and an even wider catch-all, “whether taking the drug goes against the spirit of sport,” according to Rabin. Meldonium, apparently, falls into the latter category, since Radin previously noted that “meldonium is probably not a very toxic substance.” </p>
<p>Meldonium’s short history on the naughty list is a classic case of authorities post-hoc’ing their way through a drug war. A suspect class of people took a substance; the substance became suspect as a result.</p>
<p>“Here’s a situation where WADA has to play constant catch-up,” says John Hoberman, an Olympic historian and professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “They had to include related substances [on the banned substances list] as well, because some underground chemist would tweak the testosterone molecule that wasn’t covered by the statute. They have to react to events.”</p>
<p>In the case of meldonium, that meant banning a drug without conclusive evidence that it enhances athletic performance.</p>
<p>During the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, clean Russian athletes are only permitted to compete under a neutral flag and uniform as “Olympic Athletes from Russia.” The IOC banned 11 Russian athletes for life over allegations of state-sponsored doping and what the committee called “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system at the 2014 Sochi Winter Games.</p>
<p>Russia ranked No. 1 in doping violations in 2013-2015, according to WADA, and the country has been implicated in doping scandals across many international sports in prior years.</p>
<p>This year, Putin admitted to “instances of doping” among his athletes, but also said, “There are many such examples around the world, but no one is making a big show of it.” (He’s not wrong in this. “Americans have a well-established doping regime, too; it’s just privatized and corporatized,” HuffPost’s Travis Waldron has written.)</p>
<p>It’s unclear what will happen to Krushelnitsky, or whether Russia will be reinstated as an Olympic competitor after the latest scandal. The IOC had previously suggested that it could lift its suspension on Russian athletes marching under their national flag for the closing ceremony, but IOC spokesman Mark Adams told The Associated Press that a failed doping test could prevent that.</p>

Sports">
<p>A German team doctor recommends that his country’s athletes should drink a beer directly after competing in the Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>Hey, wouldn’t have to tell most of us twice.</p>
<p>But there’s a scientific reason behind Team Germany showing up to the Winter Olympics with about 3,500 liters of non-alcoholic beer and 11,000 liters of the regular stuff.</p>
<p>With 156 athletes representing Germany in PyeongChang, that works out to 93 liters of beer per person.</p>
<p>But Johannes Scherr, a doctor for the German ski team, believes that his athletes should drink up early and often. As the New York Times reported on Monday, Scherr finds that a non-alcoholic beer consumed after physical activity is more rejuvenating than water or a sports drink.</p>
<p>Scherr conducted a published study in 2009 that found that athletes who drank a non-alcoholic beer after training or competing experienced “significantly less inflammation” and “fewer upper respiratory infections” than those who consumed a placebo. Beer contains a high concentration of polyphenols, which boost the immune system.</p>
<p>Plus, let’s face it. As the husband of a Canadian curler showed us on Monday, there are few things more satisfying than a cold beer (or two), no matter what the time.</p>
<p>Drinking a beer after a physical activity is not limited to the Germans, of course. If you’re a runner, there’s a good chance you’ve been offered a beer after, say, a 10K or a marathon.</p>
<p>But no one values their sports-related suds quite like the German. Non-alcoholic beer is aggressively marketed as a sports drink in Germany, which is only bested by Iran when it comes to consumption of non-alcoholic beer.</p>
<p>Of course, there has been plenty of reason for Germans to celebrate and head toward the alcoholic stuff once they come off the podiums in Korea. The country had 20 medals (10 gold) heading into Tuesday’s competition, the second-most of any nation.</p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Slovenia men’s ice hockey player Ziga Jeglic has tested positive for a banned substance and has been suspended for the remainder of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, the Court of Arbitration for Sport said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It added that Jeglic, who tested positive for fenoterol, had accepted the anti-doping rule violation and would leave the Olympics within 24 hours. Fenoterol can be taken for asthma as it facilitates breathing by opening up the airways.</p>
<p>Jeglic, who scored the shootout winner against Slovakia on Saturday, had failed an in-competition test and the final decision on his sanction would come after the end of the Games, CAS said.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old has played his entire career in Europe and has been competing in the Russian-based Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) for the past four seasons.</p>
<p>The Slovenian Olympic committee said Jeglic was tested four days ago and that only the ‘A’ sample had been examined before the player accepted the violation.</p>
<p>“Ziga Jeglic will not play for Slovenia against Norway today. Until the completion of the procedure, the leadership of the Slovenian Olympic team cannot and will not make any statements,” it added.</p>
<p>The case is the third positive test at the Pyeongchang Games following a Japanese reserve speed skater and Russia’s bronze medal winning curler Alexander Krushelnitsky.</p>

<p>GANGNEUNG, South Korea - Canada thumped the Olympic Athletes from Russia 5-0 on Monday to book their spot in the Olympic women’s ice hockey final and renew one of the Winter Games’s greatest rivalries.</p>
<p>Canada have played for gold at every Winter Games since women’s hockey became part of the Olympic program in 1998 and for the fifth time in six Winter Games will face off against the United States.</p>
<p>“We have something special here and we’re ready our coaching staff has prepared us as best they can and we just need to go out and just play,” Canada forward Meghan Agosta told reporters.</p>
<p>“This is something we have worked hard for all year and it comes down to one game and it is going to be the better team that comes out on top and there is no doubt in my mind that we are going to be ready for whatever it takes.”</p>
<p>The U.S. set the stage for a rematch when they shutout Finland 5-0 to reach the final for the third consecutive Olympics.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. and Canada have met on every final except at the 2006 Turin Olympics, the Americans have not had gold hung around their necks since the Nagano Games with the Canadians occupying top spot on the podium ever since.</p>
<p>On a day when International Ice Hockey Federation President Rene Fasel announced the Olympic tournament at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games would expand from eight to 10 teams, Canada and U.S. continued to show they remain a class apart.</p>
<p>Canada wasted no time getting on the scoreboard as they connected on their first shot, Natalie Spooner digging the puck out of the corner and feeding an unmarked Jennifer Wakefield, who slammed it past Valeria Tarakanova 1:50 into the opening period.</p>
<p>The defending champions dominated large stretches of play put could not put another puck by Tarakanova until Marie-Philip Poulin beat the OAR netminder with a neat backhand five minutes into the second.</p>
<p>After two gritty periods the OAR finally succumbed to Canadian pressure in the third when Wakefield collected her second of night and Emily Clark added another 31 seconds later, chasing Tarakanova from the game in favor of Nadezhda Alexandrova.</p>
<p>“I’m just excited to kind of get the monkey off my back a little bit,” Wakefield said. “We’re just excited to play them (U.S.).</p>
<p>“We have the rivalry, it’s well-documented and we’re just looking forward to the opportunity to bring home another gold.”</p>
<p>Rebecca Johnston closed out the scoring by banging home a loose puck from a scramble in front of the Russian net.</p>
<p>Shannon Szabados was not overworked but turned in a rock- solid effort in the Canadian net, making 14 saves for the shutout.</p>

<p>American alpine skier Lindsey Vonn says she’s determined to bow out of the Winter Olympics with an all-out effort. </p>
<p>Vonn, 33, issued a fierce rallying cry on Twitter Tuesday for her upcoming women’s downhill race in Pyeongchang, South Korea. She also appeared to suggest she’s retiring from Olympic competition.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow I will push out of the starting gate in what will most likely be my last Olympic Downhill race,” tweeted Vonn, who won gold in the event at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada. She was unable to defend the title at the 2014 game in Sochi, Russia, due to a knee injury.</p>
<p>“I know everyone expects a lot from me, and I expect even more of myself,” Vonn added. “However there’s only one thing I can guarantee; I will give everything I have tomorrow. Count on it.”</p>
<p>Vonn placed sixth in the women’s super-G event on Saturday. Donald Trump-supporting Twitter trolls hounded her with abuse following her failure to medal, in apparent retaliation to her earlier criticism of the president.</p>
<p>She is also scheduled to compete in the ladies’ alpine combined event on Thursday, but her best shot at glory is seen as the downhill.</p>
<p>Vonn’s determination for what could be one of her last Olympic appearances was cheered by people on Twitter:</p>

<p>In an unprecedented ruling, the University of Louisville’s men’s basketball program has been ordered to vacate its 2013 national championship title and 122 other victories following a sex scandal involving its players.</p>
<p>The NCAA Division 1 Infractions Appeals Committee announced its final decision on Tuesday after an unsuccessful appeal by the school.</p>
<p>It’s the first time in the NCAA’s modern history that a Division I men’s basketball national championship has been stripped from a school.</p>
<p>The punishment follows a 2015 investigation that found a basketball team staffer paid prostitutes to have sex with the school’s athletes and recruits and also had striptease dancers perform for them. The committee first ruled against the school last June.</p>
<p>Following the June ruling, Rick Pitino, the school’s longtime head basketball coach, was suspended for the team’s first five games of the 2017-18 season. He has since been fired in the wake of another scandal. Louisville is one of the schools the FBI is investigating for “pay for play” deals with basketball recruits. </p>
<p>The NCAA, in its final decision on the sex scandal, said that the basketball team’s former staff member knew that his actions violated NCAA bylaws. The athletes knew their behavior violated the rules, or should have known, making them ineligible for the competition.</p>
<p>“In its review of the case, the appeals committee found that because of the serious and intentional violations with direct involvement of a university staff member, the Committee on Infractions panel was within its legislated authority to prescribe the vacation of records and financial penalty,” the NCAA stated.</p>
<p>The NCAA’s ruling orders the school to vacate all of its wins during the academic years between 2011 and 2015, which included two Final Four appearances. It must also repay revenue earned from appearances in the 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 basketball tournaments, amounting to about $600,000.</p>
<p>The university’s interim president Greg Postel, said at an afternoon press conference that he agrees the conduct that led to the penalties was wrong but that he disagrees with the committee’s ruling.</p>
<p>“I cannot say this strongly enough: We believe the NCAA is simply wrong to have made this decision,” Postel said. “The pain this infraction has created for our fans and for our players who were not involved in the events in question is perhaps the most regretful result of this determination.”</p>
<p>Postel added that there will be no further appeal of the ruling, which orders the school to scrub any sign of those years’ victories from its campus and its records. Individual records of student-athletes will also be vacated.</p>
<p>Interim Athletic Director Vince Tyra said speaking at the news conference: “We’ll certainly remove the formal recognition of our accomplishments from our facilities, but [the ruling] won’t remove it from our hearts and our minds.”</p>

<p>Bobsledders from Nigeria and Jamaica made history at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the two-women bobsleigh event, Nigeria’s Seun Adigun and Akuoma Omeoga became the first bobsled team to represent an African nation. Alongside skeleton athlete Simidele Adeagbo, they are also the first athletes from their country to compete in a winter olympiad.</p>
<p>Jamaica’s Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian and Carrie Russell, meanwhile, became the Caribbean island’s first Olympic female bobsledders — following a tricky week in which their coach, Sandra Kiriasis, resigned and put their competition into jeopardy after she threatened to take the team’s bobsled.</p>
<p>They follow in the footsteps of Jamaica’s bobsled team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. Their story inspired the movie “Cool Runnings.”</p>
<p>Team USA’s Elana Meyers Taylor and Lauren Gibbs led the two-woman bobsleigh field after the first heat. Jamaica secured joint 17th place out of 20. Nigeria finished last. </p>

<p>Members of the South Korean women’s curling team are getting a taste of fame, not just because of their great Olympic performance, but also because of their delicious use of nicknames.</p>
<p>The curlers entered the Olympics ranked eighth in the world, but victories over higher-ranked teams like Canada, Switzerland, Great Britain and previously undefeated Sweden have put the team in first place, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>After beating the United States team on Monday, the 6-1 South Koreans became the first team confirmed for the semi-finals, according to NBC.</p>
<p>Their mad curling skills are earning them fans, and their nicknames are feeding the frenzy.</p>
<p>Team members Kim Eun-jung, Kim Seon-yeong, Kim Kyeong-ae, Kim Yeong-mi and alternate Kim Cho-hi all share the very common Korean surname of Kim. Only sisters Kim Kyong-ae and Kim Yeong-mi are related, according to USA Today.</p>
<p>So in order to practice their English and help others identify them, the South Korean curlers all adopted nicknames based on breakfast foods they enjoy.</p>
<p>Kim Yeong-mi is known as “Pancake,” while her sister Kim Kyeong-ae is “Steak.” Kim Eun-jung is called “Annie,” a tribute to the California-based yogurt brand. Kim Cho-hi is “Chocho” after a type of cookie. Kim Seon-yeong is called “Sunny,” after sunny-side up eggs.</p>
<p>The food connection doesn’t end there. The team members come from a town in the Gyeongsangbuk-do province, an area is known for its garlic farms.</p>
<p>As a result, many people are calling the team the “Garlic Girls,” according to Food And Wine.</p>
<p>However, coach Kim Min-jung turns up her nose at that particular moniker and is hungering for the internet to come up with a better name, according to USA Today.</p>
<p>The South Korean team’s next match is on Wednesday against Denmark. Wonder what they eat for a victory dinner?</p>

<p>A wardrobe malfunction may have cast a shadow on the first of their two Olympic performances this week, but French ice dance duo Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron refused to let the costume snafu dash their medal hopes.</p>
<p>The pair clinched the highest-ever free dance score (123.35) on Tuesday, a day after the outfit malfunction which caused Papadakis to accidentally reveal her breast during their short dance routine.</p>
<p>The mammoth score wasn’t enough to knock Canada’s Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir from the top of the podium, yet the French duo finished a close second. (The “Shib sibs” from the U.S., Alex and Maia Shibutani, took bronze.)</p>
<p>Although this was the first time that Papadakis and Cizeron competed in the Olympics, they showed great poise under pressure. The two-time world champions managed to finish second at Monday’s short dance event despite Papadakis’ outfit slip-up, which she later called her “worst nightmare.”</p>
<p>“It was pretty distracting,” the 22-year-old told The Associated Press. “I told myself, ‘I don’t have a choice. I have to keep going,’ and that’s what we did. I think we can be proud of ourselves being able to deliver a great performance with that happening.”</p>
<p>The pair scored 81.93 in the short dance event. Olympic fans lauded the duo for nailing their routine despite the mishap:</p>
<p>At the figure skating team event earlier this month, competitor Yura Min of South Korea also suffered a wardrobe malfunction midway through her performance. Like Papadakis, Min continued skating despite the costume issue, completing her routine with calm and class. </p>

<p>Canadian ice dancers Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir won the gold medal in the ice dancing competition at the 2018 Winter Olympics on Tuesday, becoming the most decorated figure skaters in Olympic history.</p>
<p>Virtue and Moir completed two breathtaking routines on Tuesday, with a short dance set to Latin, samba and cha-cha music. Their free dance portion was set to a medley from the film “Moulin Rouge,” and the duo were elated as the final notes rang out and the arena erupted into applause.</p>
<p>French skaters Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron took home the silver after scoring a world record in the free dance portion of the competition. American siblings Alex and Maia Shibutani took home the bronze.</p>
<p>The Canadian pair, who were also the team’s flag bearers at the Opening Ceremony, won another gold medal in the ice dance at the 2010 Games in Vancouver, Canada, and took home two silver medals in Sochi in 2014, in the ice dance and team event.</p>
<p>After winning their first gold last week in the team event, Moir said his teammates worked hard to bring home Canada’s first such medal of the Games.</p>
<p>“We wanted to win the team event in 2018, and we believed in ourselves and we talked about it as a team,” Moir told NBC. “We wanted to make sure we got this gold. As Canadians, we were born on the ice.”</p>
<p>With Tuesday’s win, Moir and Virtue now each have five Olympic medals, more than any other figure skaters.</p>
<p>The pair, who came out of retirement last year to stage a comeback in South Korea, said they plan to hang up their skates once again after the competition ends.</p>

<p>There was a scary moment during the halfpipe event at the Winter Olympics on Tuesday when a Swiss skier crashed into the wall hard enough to knock the skis off his feet. </p>
<p>Joel Gisler looked to be about 15 feet above the wall when he came down hard, hit the edge and plunged into the halfpipe below. </p>
<p>For a few tense moments, Gisler didn’t move as medics rushed to help. Eventually, he sat up and was able to stand and walk off the course with some assistance. </p>
<p>At the time of this writing, his condition is unknown. </p>
<p>During the event, broadcasters said the edges of the halfpipe had become damaged as the sun melted parts of it, causing chunks to fall off. One compared it to taking a skateboard out on a gravel road.</p>

<p>The U.S. women’s ice hockey team dominated on Monday, beating Finland 5-0 in the Winter Olympics semi-final in South Korea.</p>
<p>Team USA now progresses to the final, where it will meet either Canada or the Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) to battle for gold.</p>
<p>The U.S. lost to arch-rival Canada 2-1 last Thursday in a nail-biter of a game. The team fared better against OAR, convincingly outscoring the Russians 5-0 last Tuesday.</p>
<p>This is the third Winter Olympics in a row that the U.S. women’s ice hockey team has made it to the finals. The U.S. clinched the silver medal at both the 2010 and 2014 games held in Vancouver and Sochi, respectively. Canada has been the Olympic champ for the past four consecutive Winter Games.</p>
<p>The last time the U.S. women’s team won Olympic gold was in Nagano in 1998. That year, Canada took silver.</p>
<p>If the two North American rivals meet in the final, a thriller of a game should be expected. Canada and OAR will play on Monday night in the semi-final.</p>

<p>A new event debuted at the 2018 Winter Olympics, and it’s filled with all of the most spectacular parts of the Games.</p>
<p>Big jumps, incredible skill, high-flying acrobatics and the ever-present danger of massive crashes and catastrophe ― snowboard big air is an absolute adrenaline rush.</p>
<p>There’s already been a number of snowboarding events at the Winter Olympics, with Team USA’s Red Gerard and Jamie Anderson medaling in slopestyle, and Chloe Kim and Shaun White winning the halfpipe events. Big air, while already a highlight of the X Games, is a new addition to the Winter Olympics, making its debut in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>The event consists of one massive jump, with competitors starting at the top of an 160-foot ramp before hurtling down and trying to land their most spectacular trick. With such an enormous ramp ― in Pyeongchang, they need an elevator to get to the top of the jump ― the boarders manage some serious air time, throwing down multiple flips and spins as they leap up to 100 feet in the air.</p>
<p>Snowboard big air debuted at the Winter Olympics on Monday with the women’s qualification rounds. Each competitor gets two jumps, and judges score their tricks. Riders advance based on their single best score. Slopestyle gold medallist Jamie Anderson scored 90 points, placing her sixth in the 26-woman field, while Japanese riders Yuka Fujimori and Reira Iwabuchi and Canada’s Laurie Blouin also impressed. Austrian world champion Anna Gasser blitzed the competition however, scoring an incredible 98 points.</p>
<p>“I was so excited when big air was added to the Olympics,” Gasser told ESPN. “People are going to like it because it’s spectacular and exciting.”</p>
<p>The first qualification round delivered everything expected, from incredible flips, unbelievable landings and even some crashes. Australian rider Jess Rich is competing after rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in her knee ― usually a debilitating and season-ending injury for any athlete ― just a month ago.</p>
<p>Check out some footage from the event’s debut in Pyeongchang below, and tune in for the men’s qualifying on Wednesday, the women’s final on Friday, and the men’s final on Saturday.</p>

<p>LeBron James, who has refused to heed Fox News host Laura Ingraham’s advice to “shut up and dribble,” had a pointed message for the watching world on Sunday — and he wore it proudly on his shoes.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Cavaliers star arrived at the NBA All-Star Game at Staples Center in Los Angeles wearing a pair of white Nike sneakers with the words “More Than An Athlete” emblazoned on them.</p>
<p>James shared a shot of his shoes in an Instagram story Sunday afternoon with a “FACTS” hashtag and the “100” emoji.</p>
<p>Ingraham criticized James and Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant last week for lambasting President Donald Trump in an interview with ESPN’s Cari Champion. James said in the interview that Trump “doesn’t understand the people and really don’t give a fuck about the people.” </p>
<p>Reacting to the interview, Ingraham told the athletes to “shut up and dribble” and to “keep the political commentary to yourself.”</p>
<p>James and Durant, however, were having none of it. Durant told USA Today that Ingraham’s comments were “racist” and that while he does “play basketball, I am a civilian and ... a citizen of the United States, so my voice is just as loud as hers ― or even louder”</p>
<p>James stressed on Saturday that he would “definitely not shut up and dribble.” </p>
<p>“So, thank you, whatever her name is. ... I get to sit up here and talk about what’s really important and how I can help change kids,” James said at a media session following the All-Star Game practice in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“I mean too much to society, I mean too much to the youth, I mean too much to so many kids that feel like they don’t have a way out and they need someone to help lead them out of the situation they’re in,” he added.</p>
<p>Ingraham defended her remarks in a statement sent via a Fox spokesperson. “If pro athletes and entertainers want to freelance as political pundits, then they should not be surprised when they’re called out for insulting politicians,” she said. “There was no racial intent in my remarks ― false, defamatory charges of racism are a transparent attempt to immunize entertainment and sports elites from scrutiny and criticism.”</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time James has used his shoes to make a strong statement. Last year, he wore sneakers with the word “Equality” embroidered in gold to at least two games.</p>
<p>Explaining his decision to wear the shoes at a December game in Washington, D.C., James suggested he was wearing them in protest of Trump’s divisive words and policies. </p>
<p>“We’re not going to let one person dictate us, us as Americans, how beautiful and how powerful we are as a people,” he said at the time. “Equality is all about understanding our rights, understanding what we stand for and how powerful we are as men and women, black or white or Hispanic. It doesn’t matter your race, whatever the case may be.”</p>

<p>GANGNEUNG, South Korea, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Russian athletes and sports officials voiced disbelief on Monday that one of their Winter Games medallists was being investigated for suspected doping, a scandal that could imperil Russia’s efforts to regain full Olympic status.</p>
<p>Alexander Krushelnitsky, who competes in curling, one of the Games’ least physically taxing sports, is suspected of testing positive for meldonium, a banned substance that increases blood flow and improves exercise capacity.</p>
<p>“It’s stupid, but Alexander is not stupid, so I don’t believe it,” Russian women’s curling coach Sergei Belanov said.</p>
<p>He echoed a general bewilderment among curling athletes who could not fathom why anyone would use drugs that aid endurance in a sport that is a kind of chess on ice, needing steady hands and concentration rather than physical fitness.</p>
<p>Krushelnitsky, who won bronze with his wife Anastasia Bryzgalova in mixed-doubles curling in Pyeongchang, has not responded to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has launched a doping procedure against him, but no hearing date has been fixed.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call in Moscow that it was too early to draw conclusions about the ongoing probe.</p>
<p>Russian delegation spokesman Konstantin Vybornov told Reuters that Krushelnitsky had surrendered his Games accreditation and left the Olympic village while awaiting the result of a second sample later on Monday.</p>
<p>The suspected doping violation has come at a delicate time for Russia which is trying to draw a line under years of drug-cheating scandals and is competing at Pyeongchang as neutral athletes, unable to use their own flag or national symbols.</p>
<p>“We were all shocked when we found out yesterday. Of course we very much hope it was some kind of mistake,” Russian curler Viktoria Moiseeva told reporters, adding that the team believed Krushelnitsky was innocent.</p>
<p>“With us it’s not faster, higher, stronger; it’s about being more accurate. I can’t imagine what kind of drugs you could use in curling ... so it’s very hard to believe.”</p>
<p>FLAG BAN</p>
<p>Russia has been accused of running a state-backed, systematic doping program for years, an allegation Moscow denies. As a result, its athletes are competing at Pyeongchang as neutral “Olympic Athletes from Russia” (OAR).</p>
<p>Russia’s curling federation told Reuters on Monday it had launched an internal investigation of the doping case.</p>
<p>“The federation is now creating an emergency commission in which all information will be investigated and verified. We know that our athlete is not guilty,” federation president Dmitry Svishchev said.</p>
<p>He had earlier said that Russian curlers were tested on Jan. 22 before arriving in South Korea and the tests were negative.</p>
<p>Moiseeva said it would be dreadful if the case hurt Russia’s chances of regaining full Olympic status for future Games.</p>
<p>“It’s a catastrophe, if it’s not just one Olympics but others too - it will throw sport in our country into turmoil. It’s awful just to think about, to be honest.”</p>
<p>The Russians had been hoping that a clean record at Pyeongchang would persuade the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to allow them to march at the closing ceremony on Feb. 25 with the Russian flag and in national uniform.</p>
<p>The IOC said on Monday that any doping violation would be decided by CAS and that a decision would come very quickly after analysis of a B sample.</p>
<p>If confirmed, the violation would be considered by the IOC’s OAR Implementation panel, the body in charge of monitoring the OAR team’s behavior at the Games.</p>
<p>“REALLY SAD”</p>
<p>“I hope it’s not true ... for the sport of curling,” said Norwegian skipper Thomas Ulsrud, whose team would stand to pick up the bronze if the doping result is confirmed.</p>
<p>“If it’s true I feel really sad for the Norwegian team who worked really hard and ended up in fourth place and just left for Norway and they aren’t even here.”</p>
<p>The World Anti-Doping Agency banned meldonium with effect from January 2016, deeming it performance-enhancing because it enabled users to carry more oxygen to muscle tissue, something of benefit to endurance athletes in particular.</p>
<p>Former tennis world number one Maria Sharapova of Russia was barred from competition for 15 months after testing positive. In total, more than 170 athletes, including over 40 Russians, have tested positive for the drug since it was banned.</p>

<p>French Alpine skier Mathieu Faivre has been sent home from the 2018 Winter Olympics after he suggested that he didn’t care about his teammates and was “here to race for myself only.”</p>
<p>The 26-year-old, who is dating Olympic women’s giant slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin of the U.S. team, made the controversial comments to a reporter after finishing seventh in the men’s giant slalom in Pyeongchang on Sunday. Three of his countrymen placed above him in the event, including bronze medalist Alexis Pinturault.</p>
<p>Faivre, who won gold in the team event at last year’s World Championships, was asked by a reporter how he felt about French skiers filling four of the top seven spots, Agence France-Presse reported.</p>
<p>Faivre was quoted as saying he was “disgusted with the result” and “I’m here to race for myself only.”</p>
<p>“If you only knew what I think about the group collective,” Faivre said. “I felt I was skiing well in the second run but when I saw where I’d finished, it was like a slap in the face.”</p>
<p>David Chastan, the director for the French men’s skiing program, confirmed to AFP on Monday that Faivre was sent home.</p>
<p>“Mathieu will return to France for disciplinary reasons,” Chastan told the news agency. “He made remarks after the race that were not in the spirit of the team and will not be retained for the team event.”</p>
<p>That team event is scheduled for Saturday.</p>
<p>Faivre has since issued an apology on Facebook, saying he meant no disrespect to anyone.</p>
<p>“Skiing is an individual sport that is practiced as a team. However, when we are in the starting gate, only our individual race and our own performance are important,” Faivre posted. “So yes, when it came time to give my feelings on my race, 10 minutes after crossing the finish line, only my performance and failure were present.”</p>
<p>Faivre has been dating Shiffrin, 22, since last summer. She recently told Us Weekly that because of the distance between them ― with Faivre living in France and Shiffrin in Colorado ― it’s been difficult for them to see each other.</p>
<p>Shiffrin earned her first gold medal of the 2018 Games on Thursday but has since decided to skip Tuesday’s women’s downhill event so she can focus on Wednesday’s super combined.</p>
<p>Faivre was photographed congratulating her shortly after her big win last week.</p>

<p>Canadian ice dancing power duo Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir broke a world record on Sunday at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, earning the highest score ever in the short program.</p>
<p>The couple, skating to a saucy routine that featured The Rolling Stones’ “Sympathy for the Devil,” an acoustic version of the Eagles’ “Hotel California” and Santana’s “Oye Como Va,” received a score of 83.67. </p>
<p>That score broke their previous world record, 82.68, set at Skate Canada last year.</p>
<p>Virtue and Moir are in first place in ice dancing at the 2018 Olympics. A win would be their second gold medal at this year’s games. They also took home gold at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, and silver at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia.</p>
<p>Of their achievement on Sunday, Moir said to NBC: “To go out and connect and perform like that, that’s why we came back.”</p>
<p>Moir showed his happiness post-skate with a leap:</p>
<p>Twitter also took part in joy for the ice dancers:</p>
<p>For her part, Virtue told Reuters: “It feels great but even better than the world record is the feeling we had when we ended the program. We’re really pleased with that performance. On the world’s biggest stage when the pressure is mounting, it’s nice to be able to deliver like that.”</p>

<p>Fans will have to wait to see Adam Rippon appear regularly on the small screen.</p>
<p>The charismatic figure skater will not be joining NBC as a contributor, the network confirmed to HuffPost, after Rippon clarified the news during a Monday morning interview from Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>“I am so flattered that NBC wanted me to work as a correspondent,” Rippon said on NBCSN. “But if I took this opportunity, I would have to leave the Olympic team and I would have to leave the [Olympic] Village.”</p>
<p>He continued, “It’s so important to me, you know, I worked so hard to be on this Olympic team, and my teammates and my friends were there for me during my events, and that meant so much to me, that I really feel like I need to be there for them during their events as well.”</p>
<p>He echoed the comment later on Twitter.</p>
<p>USA Today’s Christine Brennan, who previously reported Rippon was joining the network, tweeted a similar sentiment, saying a source told her Rippon didn’t want to “relinquish his official Olympic standing ... and miss the closing ceremony.” According to Brennan, Rippon agreed to the gig but later turned it down after learning how he’d have to separate from the team.</p>
<p>NBC did not respond to HuffPost’s requests for comment. </p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, USA Today reported 28-year-old Rippon, one of the first openly gay U.S. figure skaters to compete in the Olympics, had been recruited as a contributor for the remainder of the games. He has made headlines throughout his time in Pyeongchang, first calling out Vice President Mike Pence for his anti-LGBTQ stances, and later for his hilarious one-liners.</p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - The Alpine skiing team event looks like lacking in star quality when it makes its Olympic debut in Pyeongchang this week after Lindsey Vonn became the latest high-profile athlete to say she probably won’t be taking part.</p>
<p>The inaugural team event is scheduled for Saturday as the climax to the program and will bring mixed sex competition, knockout racing and parallel skiing to the Olympic Alpine slopes for the first time.</p>
<p>Marcel Hirscher, who has claimed two gold medals in Pyeongchang, ruled out competing for Austria before the start of the Olympics because he felt it would compromise his bid to win a seventh successive World Cup overall title.</p>
<p>Norwegian speed racers Aksel Lund Svindal, the men’s downhill champion, and Kjetil Jansrud have headed back to Europe after the completion of their individual events.</p>
<p>American Teg Ligety said he would race in the event if overall World Cup leader Mikaela Shiffrin did, but on Sunday he confirmed his run in the men’s giant slalom had brought an end to his Pyeongchang Olympics.</p>
<p>“I was an absolute no before but I was thinking about it,” Vonn said on Monday.</p>
<p>“But now Ted’s gone and Mikaela is not doing it and so I don’t really think we have a strong chance of getting a medal since none of our top athletes are doing it so I probably won’t.”</p>
<p>Hirscher, favorite to win a third gold in the men’s slalom on Thursday, had said competing in the team event would allow him insufficient time to get to Slovenia for the resumption of the World Cup next week.</p>
<p>“It would be a big honor to start for Austria but... it is not possible,” the 28-year-old said.</p>
<p>“If you do the team event, four days later you are back in Europe at Kranjska Gora in the giant slalom, no time for preparation, no time for recovery, no time for getting used to European time.</p>
<p>“So, it would be great to be there but if I’m professional, it is not possible.”</p>
<p>The team event, an attempt by the governing International Ski Federation to refresh the Alpineprogram, will be contested by 16 teams on a knockout basis with the winners of the final round taking gold.</p>

<p>Depending on who you ask, Olympic skier Elizabeth Swaney is either an embarrassment to the Winter Games or the unsung hero of mediocre athletes everywhere. </p>
<p>Swaney, an American competing for Hungary in the women’s halfpipe event in Pyeongchang, South Korea, caught viewers’ attention on Monday not for her skills but for her, well, complete lack thereof. </p>
<p>NBC has the full clip of her performance here on its site.</p>
<p>Even NBC’s commentators struggled to describe what Swaney was doing on the slopes as she made run after run with no attempts to catch any air or try complex tricks. </p>
<p>She placed 24th ― dead last. </p>
<p>Swaney ― a 33-year-old from Oakland, California, who qualified for Hungary’s team through her grandparents’ heritage ― didn’t just get cold feet.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, the software engineer recruiter with big athletic dreams just isn’t up to Olympic standards, and she essentially gamed the system, taking advantage of rules at qualifying events. She often finished within the top 30 ― and thus met the qualifying cutoff ― because there weren’t that many competitors.</p>
<p>“The field is not that deep in the women’s pipe and she went to every World Cup, where there were only 24, 25, or 28 women,” ski halfpipe and slopestyle judge Steele Spence told The Denver Post in a profile this week about Swaney, whose competitions are completely self-funded</p>
<p>“She would compete in them consistently over the last couple years and sometimes girls would crash so she would not end up dead last,” he said.</p>
<p>Spence added that there is some plan in the works to change the qualifying rules. </p>
<p>Swaney got lucky with a few other loopholes, as Deadspin reported: </p>
<p> Because a few competitors pulled out of the Olympics with injury, because of limits on how many skiers from a single country can compete in the same event, and because of some arcane reallocation rules within the Hungarian ski federation designed to balance men’s and women’s competitors, Swaney got to go do her fake run in Pyeongchang. </p>
<p>Swaney’s scheming her way into the competition has apparently peeved other athletes, sources told the Denver newspaper, but let’s hand it to her for shameless perseverance.</p>
<p>Don’t hate the player, Olympic skiers, hate the game.</p>
<p>”I want to show others that freestyle skiing is possible and it is never too late to get into this sport, and to help others to dream and to progress the sport in Hungary,” Swaney, who first started skiing at 25, told Reuters. “I hope this can be a platform to inspire others.”</p>

<p>Team USA will once again face Canada for gold in women’s hockey, extending an Olympic rivalry with roots stretching back to the sport’s first appearance at the Winter Games in 1998.</p>
<p>The two teams have played each other for gold in every Winter Olympics final since then with the exception of 2006, when the U.S. failed to make the gold-medal round. </p>
<p>Canada has won four straight gold medals in the event. The U.S. won its sole gold in 1998.</p>
<p>This year, both teams dispatched rivals in the semifinal 5-0 to advance to the gold medal game in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Finland will play the Olympic Athletes from Russia for the bronze.</p>
<p>In the women’s hockey round robin last week, Canada narrowly beat the U.S. 2-1, thanks to an outstanding performance by Canadian goaltender Geneviève Lacasse, who stopped 44 of 45 shots on goal. Team USA outshot Canada 45-23.</p>
<p>The gold medal match will air on Wednesday, Feb. 21 at 11:10 p.m. ET on NBC Sports Network and streaming on NBCOlympics.com.</p>

<p>Germany and Canada both were winners in the two-man bobsled race at the Winter Olympics on Monday in the first gold-medal tie in the event since 1998.</p>
<p>Both teams finished four runs with identical combined times ― down to the hundredth of a second ― of 3.16.86 in the dramatic competition in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>Latvia came in a close third place, with a time of 3:16.91.</p>
<p>The bobsled event’s last first-place tie was between Italy and Canada, when both teams finished with times of 3.37.24 at the games in Nagano, Japan. That was also the last time that Canada won gold in the event.</p>
<p>Monday’s win gave Germany’s two-man bobsled team its eighth gold medal since 1928. The team took home gold and silver medals at the 2010 games, as well as gold in the 2006 and 2002 Olympics. </p>

<p>As our internet-impaired attention spans shrink, baseball games in recent decades have gotten longer. That’s a problem for Major League Baseball, which is struggling to attract younger fans.</p>
<p>On Monday, the league announced rule changes for the 2018 season intended to increase the speed of play and shorten games.</p>
<p>The most drastic revision will be a limit on the number of visits to the pitcher’s mound per game. Until this season, coaches, managers and other players could confer with their pitcher as much as they wanted. They’ll now be limited to just six visits per nine-inning game. Teams will be allotted one additional mound visit for each extra inning. </p>
<p>There are some exceptions to what qualifies as a mound visit, according to MLB’s new rules, including:</p>
<p> A. Discussions between pitchers and position player(s) that (i) occur between batters in the normal course of play and do not require either the position player(s) or the pitcher to relocate;B. Visits by position players to the mound to clean spikes in rainy conditions;C. Visits to the mound due to an injury or potential injury of the pitcher; andD. Visits to the mound after the announcement of an offensive substitution. </p>
<p>The MLB also said it plans to set two-minute limits on breaks between innings and at pitching changes.</p>
<p>To the relief of players, the MLB won’t implement a 20-second pitch clock or a between-batter timer, though Commissioner Rob Manfred indicated those steps may be considered in the future if Monday’s changes aren’t sufficient.</p>
<p>“I am hopeful that the changes we make directed at downtime will eventually get us into a spot where we’re comfortable with pace of play and the length of the game,” Manfred told reporters last week. “But if not there can be conversations about other types of changes that might go beyond downtime.”</p>

<p>Fergie took a stab at the national anthem during the NBA All-Star Game at the Staples Center on Sunday night, and it didn’t go so well. </p>
<p>Her attempt to add a jazz twist to the “Star-Spangled Banner” ― already a notoriously difficult song to sing ― prompted some pretty strong feelings. </p>

<p>USA Gymnastics may not be the only Olympic organization that has a systemic problem with sexual abuse.</p>
<p>A lengthy investigative report from the Southern California News Group ― published Friday at one of the group’s newspapers, the Orange County Register ― says that USA Swimming ignored or covered up hundreds of sexual abuse cases over the course of decades. The report is reminiscent of the recent USA Gymnastics scandal involving former team doctor and convicted pedophile Larry Nassar ― where the people in power cared only about winning and safeguarding the sport’s image, subsequently protecting and enabling an abuser to prey on young athletes. </p>
<p>Citing court documents and internal communications, the SCNG report says USA Swimming enabled hundreds of predators, most of whom were coaches, and allowed a culture of abuse where it was accepted for older coaches to have sexual relationships with underage athletes. The article centers on Chuck Wielgus, the former USA Swimming executive director who died in April of complications from colon cancer. </p>
<p>“USA Swimming repeatedly missed opportunities to overhaul a culture within American swimming where the sexual abuse of underage swimmers by their coaches and others in positions of power within the sport was commonplace and even accepted by top officials and coaches, according to the documents and interviews with sexual abuse survivors, former Olympians, USA Swimming officials, safe sport advocates and some of USA Swimming’s leading financial benefactors,” the SCNG report states.</p>
<p>USA Swimming did not respond to SCNG’s requests for comment, the Register article notes. USA Swimming did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment for this story.</p>
<p>SCNG sifted through hundreds of USA Swimming memos, emails, court records, law enforcement interviews and congressional reports, and concluded that the organization has been “unwilling to take on its coach-centric power base and obsessed with protecting its image and brand.”</p>
<p>The investigation made five principal claims:</p>
<p>  Top USA Swimming executives, officials and coaches knew of multiple sexual predators in coaching positions for years and did nothing to stop it.    Since 1997, at least 590 alleged victims of sexual abuse have been identified in the USA Swimming world. At least 252 coaches and officials have been arrested, charged or disciplined by USA Swimming for sexual assault or sexual misconduct against athletes under the age of 18. In four of the past six years, “at least 20 swim coaches have been arrested, charged or convicted for sex crimes ranging from rape, sexually assaulting a 3-year-old and 8-year-old, statutory rape, child pornography to secretly videotaping underage swimmers in locker-rooms,” the report notes.    At least 30 USA swim coaches or officials have been “flagged” by USA Swimming after being accused of or arrested for sexual abuse or child pornography by law enforcement. Most of the coaches and officials on the flagged list were able to continue working in the swim world. Some officials were not banned from the sport even after they had been convicted of felonies.    Over the years, USA Swimming has been quick to spend money to settle sexual abuse cases before they can hit the public radar. Between 2006 and 2016, USA Swimming spent $7,450,000 on legal fees. It’s not clear how much of that money was spent to settle sexual abuse cases, but SCNG notes that USA Swimming “arranged settlement agreements in at least three states with victims of alleged sexual abuse by swim coaches before the cases were even filed with a court.”   USA Swimming shelled out over $75,000 to lobbying firms to mobilize against California legislation that would have made it easer for sexual abuse survivors to sue their attackers and the organizations they worked for in civil suits.  </p>
<p>Mike Saltzstein, a former member of USA Swimming’s board of directors, told SCNG that the organization’s goal is to ensure its brand stays clean at all costs. </p>
<p>“I’m not sure there’s the institutional incentive, intestinal fortitude, guts, if you will, to do what needs to be done,” he said. “Their attitude is let’s smooth things over. Let’s hide things.” </p>
<p>Former Olympic swimmer Ariana Kukors recently said that her longtime coach Sean Hutchison sexually abused her for nearly a decade. Kukors, now 28, said Hutchison began “grooming” her when she was 13, after he became her coach at King Aquatic, a swimming club in Seattle. </p>
<p> “I never thought I would share my story because, in so many ways, just surviving was enough,” Kukors said. “I was able to leave a horrible monster and build a life I could have never imagined for myself. But in time, I’ve realized that stories like my own are too important to go unwritten.” </p>
<p> Kukors said Hutchison waited to have sex with her until she was 18, and the two later moved in together. The swimmer described Hutchison as manipulative, jealous and verbally abusive. Hutchison has reportedly denied the allegations. Nancy Hogshead-Makar, a former Olympic swimmer and founder of the advocacy group Champion Women, told SCNG it’s somewhat common for top coaches to marry swimmers they once coached. That culture, she says, is wildly problematic. “When the organization allows for marriages, allows for the 11-year-old to see her 18-year-old teammate who she thinks is a peer, she thinks they are the same, they go to the same meets, they’re staying in the same hotel, they are working out together, then she sees that [older swimmer] marrying their coach so she thinks this is true love and doesn’t recognize what an inappropriate situation this is,” Hogshead-Makar said.  President Donald Trump signed a bill into law last week that aims to protect amateur athletes from sexual abuse by regulating the governing bodies of amateur athletics, like USA Swimming. The legislation requires coaches and other sport officials to report any abuse allegations to police within a 24-hour period, and extends the statute of limitations to up to 10 years after a person realizes they were abused. The bill also limits athletes under the age of 18 from being alone with an adult who isn’t their parent.  “[This bill] goes across all amateur sports, not just gymnastics, not just swimming ― it’s all amateur sports to protect all kids,” Jeanette Antolin, a former gymnast who was abused by Nassar, told HuffPost in January. “Because all kids should be able to go and do sports without having to worry about adult predators.”  Head over to the Orange County Register to read the report in full.  </p>

<p>UPDATE ― Adam Rippon said Sunday night that he would not be joining NBC as a correspondent after learning he’d have to leave Team USA and the Olympic Village for the new role.</p>
<p>PREVIOUSLY — Adam Rippon will continue to shine under the Winter Olympic spotlight.</p>
<p>NBC has recruited the 28-year-old figure skater as a correspondent for the rest of the games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, reports USA TODAY.</p>
<p>Rippon, the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete in the Olympics, helped Team USA to bronze in the team event and placed 10th in the men’s single skating.</p>
<p>He tongue-in-cheek described some of his skating as “witchcraft.”</p>
<p>Prior to the games, he hit the headlines for calling out Vice President Mike Pence over his intolerance toward the LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>It’s not currently clear how NBC will deploy its new star its coverage, with spokesman Greg Hughes only saying that Rippon would work on its television, digital and social media offerings.</p>
<p>Will it look something like the video below?</p>
<p>Or like this?</p>
<p>However Rippon’s imminent analysis of the games pans out, he’ll be sure to have at least two celebrity viewers in pop star Britney Spears and Hollywood actress Reese Witherspoon.</p>

<p>When it comes to clinching gold at the Winter Olympics, sometimes every millimeter counts.</p>
<p>French biathlete Martin Fourcade captured the gold medal ― the fourth in his career ― in the men’s 15km mass start competition on Sunday in a dramatic neck-and-neck finish at the games in Peongchang, South Korea. </p>
<p>The 29-year-old crossed the end line just barely ahead of Simon Schempp of Germany. Both men, in a last-ditch dive, stretched toward the line but it was Fourcade who managed to cross it first, passing Schempp by just a few millimeters, the BBC reported. That’s less than an inch.</p>
<p>Both recorded the same time of 35 minutes, 47.3 seconds. Biathlon combines skiing and shooting, with the men’s 15km event featuring five laps around a 3km course and four shooting rounds </p>
<p>Bronze went to Emil Hegle Svendsen of Norway.</p>
<p>The race’s victor took more than a minute to declare, as judges reviewed replays that ultimately showed Fourcade’s left boot crossing the line before Schempp.</p>
<p>Fourcade, who placed second in the event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, initially thought he lost to Schempp. He was seen angrily hitting one of his ski poles on the ground.</p>
<p>“Four years ago in Sochi I lost by only three centimeters, so I thought the story was repeating again. Tonight it’s incredible,” he later told reporters.</p>
<p>Fourcade’s victory made him France’s most successful Winter Olympian of all time.</p>
<p>Fourcade won gold last week in the men’s 12.5km pursuit and two gold and two silver medals at the 2014 games.</p>
<p>This story has been updated with details on replays of the the race and comments by Fourcade.</p>

Sports">
<p>When all is said and done, ties are really just the unappealing result of an absence of certitude, which is why they’re such tough pills to swallow for fans and athletes alike, particularly in individual sports. However, while it may seem counterintuitive to the spirit of an athletic competition that awards medals for first, second and third place, ties actually do occur at the Olympics.</p>
<p>In fact, ties at the Olympics aren’t as rare as you might think. There have been nine ties for Winter Olympic medals since the 1998 Nagano Games, and while that may be a complicated experience for the athletes and nations involved, the protocol is actual quite simple.</p>
<p>If a pair of athletes or two teams tie for first-place, they each receive a gold medal, no one is awarded silver and the bronze is awarded to the runner-up. This was the case during the women’s downhill final at Sochi in 2014 when Slovenia’s Tina Maze and Switzerland’s Dominique Gisin both crossed the finish line with a time of 1:41.57. They were both awarded gold medals and the runner-up, Switzerland’s Lara Gut, took home bronze with her time of 1:41.67.</p>
<p>If a pair of athletes tie for second place, they are each awarded a silver medal and there is no bronze given out. This occurred most recently at the 2010 Vancouver Games in the men’s individual biathlon. Emil Hegle Svendsen of Norway finished with the best time to win gold. Both Sergey Novikov of Belarus and Ole Einar Bjørndalen of Norway finished with exactly the same second-place time, so they each won a silver medal and no bronze was awarded.</p>
<p>If a pair of athletes tie for third-place, they are each awarded a bronze medal and gold and silver are awarded as per usual to the first and second-place finishers. This situation played out in PyeongChang on Saturday when Norway’s Marit Bjørgen and Finland’s Krista Pärmäkoski both crossed the finish line with a third-place time of 25:32.4 in the women’s cross-country 10km freestyle. They each won bronze, Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla won the silver medal with a time of 25:20.8 and Nowary’s Ragnhild Haga won gold with a time of 25:00.5.</p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Freestyle silver medallist Nick Goepper plans to savor his second taste of Olympic success after a struggle to cope with media attention following the Sochi Games four years ago plunged him into a downward spiral of alcohol abuse and depression.</p>
<p>“It is important to have a plan. Failure to plan is planning to fail,” the American told reporters after taking second place in Sunday’s ski slopestyle final.</p>
<p>After winning bronze as part of a United States clean sweep in 2014, the then 19-year-old from the American Midwest was thrown into the media spotlight and found the attention hard to deal with.</p>
<p>“I had no real plan after Sochi, I was just partying a lot with my friends and just flying into this void,” he told reporters. “Three weeks after the Olympics I was like ‘what am I doing?’”</p>
<p>In the build-up to the Pyeongchang Olympics, Goepper admitted he had considered committing suicide as his drinking got out of hand after Sochi.</p>
<p>“(Alcohol) was a symptom of this problem, for sure. That symptom got pretty bad at one point but I was able to go to a treatment center for a couple of months and figure myself out, getting the important help that I needed,” said Goepper, who went into rehabilitation in late 2015.</p>
<p>Now, older and wiser, Goepper says he has not had a drink in two-and-a-half years and this medal means more to him than the bronze from Sochi.</p>
<p>“I loved having the experience over the last four years,” said Goepper. “I love having traveled a bit more and I appreciate this a bit more because I am a little bit older and I can reflect and reminisce on the last 10 years of my career and look forward to the next 10.”</p>
<p>This time around, once he has ridden the wave of media obligations, Goepper has a plan. “I just want to stay humble, stay focussed. I just love skiing and I love competing and I want to get back to it as soon as I can,” he said.</p>

<p>U.S. alpine skier Ted Ligety may have had a tough time on the slopes at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Sunday.</p>
<p>But after a disappointing performance in the men’s giant slalom event, the athlete’s 8-month-old son Jax was on hand to put everything into context.</p>
<p>“He is the bright spot on the day,” Ligety captioned a photograph of the pair, which he shared to Instagram:</p>
<p>“Jax could give two s___s that daddy sucked at work today,” he added.</p>
<p>Ligety, a two-time Olympic champion who scooped golds at both Sochi 2014 in Russia and Turin 2006 in Italy, placed joint 15th in the giant slalom. It followed his earlier fifth place in the alpine combined and a failure to finish the super-G.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old still has the men’s slalom event to come, but suggested Sunday that he may now call it quits in Pyeongchang. “This is probably it for me (at) these games,” he said, per Reuters.</p>
<p>“I was thinking about doing the slalom but we tried to figure out where I’d start and it would be in the 70s or 80s, which is really far out to have a chance to have a good run at it,” he added. “I’ll probably just head back to Europe now and get ready for the rest of the World Cups.”</p>

<p>  PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) ― A Russian medalist at the Pyeongchang WinterOlympics is suspected of having tested positive for a banned substance, a source at the Games said on Sunday, in a potential major blow to Russia’s efforts to emerge from a drug-cheating scandal. Alexander Krushelnitsky, a bronze-medalist along with his wife in mixed-doubles curling, is suspected of having tested positive for meldonium, the source said. Meldonium increases blood flow which improves exercise capacity in athletes. Krushelnitsky did not respond immediately to a request for comment. A spokesman for theRussian delegation at Pyeongchang said he had no immediate comment. Russia has been accused of running a state-backed, systematic doping program for years, an allegation Moscow denies. As a result, its athletes are competing at Pyeongchang as neutral “Olympic Athletes from Russia” (OAR). Russian sports officials are to meet anti-doping officers at Pyeongchang, the source said, adding that any violation would only be confirmed after analysis of a “B” sample. Krushelnitsky and his wife, Anastasia Bryzgalova, won bronze in a game against Norway, which would take that medal if a doping violation were to be confirmed. “I hope it’s not true ... for the sport of curling,” said Norwegian team skipper Thomas Ulsrud. “If it’s true I feel really sad for the Norwegian team who worked really hard and ended up in fourth place and just left for Norway and they aren’t even here.” The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it had taken note of the case without going into details. It said that if the case were to be confirmed, it would be considered by its OAR Implementation panel, the body in charge of monitoring the OAR team’s behavior at the Games. “On the one hand it is extremely disappointing when prohibited substances might have been used, but on the other hand it shows the effectiveness of the anti-doping system at the Games which protects the rights of all the clean athletes,” an IOC spokesperson said. As neutral athletes, the Russians are unable to have their anthem played in medal ceremonies or use national symbols. The IOC has said it may allow the Russians to march with the Russian flag and in national uniform at the Games closing ceremony on Feb. 25, provided they will have complied with its code of conduct on neutrality. The code requires compliance with IOC anti-doping rules. (Additional reporting by Karolos Grohmann and Steve Keating; Editing by Mark Bendeich)  </p>

<p>NHL analyst Mike Milbury referred to one hockey player’s domestic abuse conviction as an “unfortunate incident,” as he offered commentary for NBC’s coverage of the men’s match between Team USA and the Olympics Athletes from Russia on Saturday. </p>
<p>Speaking about OAR player Slava Voynov, Milbury said, “He left a huge void in the Los Angeles Kings’ defense, otherwise may have gone on to win more than the championships they did already.”</p>
<p>“This guy was a special player, and an unfortunate incident left the Los Angeles Kings without a great defenseman,” he added.</p>
<p>Voynov was previously an Los Angeles Kings player until he was indefinitely suspended in 2014 following an arrest for domestic violence. After his wife accused him of choking, hitting and pushing her into a television, he pleaded no contest on a misdemeanor charge of corporal injury to a spouse. A judge sentenced him to 90 days in jail.</p>
<p>As commentator Kenny Albert recounted Voynov’s path to becoming a competitor for Team OAR in Pyeongchang, Milbury lamented the “huge void” left on the Kings with Voynov’s absence. </p>
<p>Milbury later defended his comment, arguing he was merely providing context for Voynov’s suspension.</p>
<p>“As I said at the time when he was suspended, the league made the right call, 100 percent,” Milbury said.</p>
<p>Several of Voynov’s OAR teammates have argued he “deserves to be” at the Olympics this year.</p>
<p>“I know that he’s a good player and obviously he deserves to be here,” Mikhail Grigorenko said Tuesday, according to local Florida television station WFLA. “He’s one of our leaders on defense, so I’m not surprised he’s here. The around-hockey stuff, there’s people that decide that.”</p>

<p>LeBron James made it clear on Saturday that he has no intention of keeping his mouth shut and dribbling a basketball.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Cavaliers star said after Saturday’s NBA All-Star Game practice in Los Angeles that he will “talk about what’s really important” when it comes to the state of race relations in America.</p>
<p>Fox News host Laura Ingraham criticized James earlier this week for expressing his opinions, including the quickly infamous “shut up and dribble” comment.</p>
<p>“I will not just shut up and dribble,” James said during his media session. .”.. So, thank you, whatever her name is. ... I get to sit up here and talk about what’s really important and how I can help change kids.”</p>
<p>James has used his platform and ability to reach people. He has criticized President Donald Trump and did so again in January when he and Golden State Warriors star Kevin Durant sat down with ESPN and both issued strong comments condemning the leadership in the White House.</p>
<p>Ingraham’s comments — they included telling James to “keep the political commentary to yourself” — were in reference to the James/Durant interview.</p>
<p>James initially put a #wewillnotshutupanddribble hashtag on his Instagram account after hearing Ingraham’s remarks.</p>
<p>“It lets me know that everything I’ve been saying is correct for her to have that type of reaction,” James said Saturday of Ingraham. “But we will definitely not shut up and dribble. I will definitely not do that.</p>
<p>“I mean too much to society, I mean too much to the youth, I mean too much to so many kids that feel like they don’t have a way out and they need someone to help lead them out of the situation they’re in.”</p>
<p>Durant echoed James’ comment with some of his own on Saturday.</p>
<p>“I feel like everybody has a voice, especially with our own platforms, we can use our voices for good,” Durant said. “It’s not just me. I feel like everybody in this room has a voice and it’s getting louder and louder every day, so we’ve got to speak what we believe in, we’ve got to speak our truths, and we’ve got to keep it real out here.”</p>
<p>Ingraham released a statement Saturday defending her comments.</p>
<p>“In 2003, I wrote a New York Times bestseller called ‘Shut Up & Sing,’ in which I criticized celebrities like the Dixie Chicks and Barbra Streisand, who were trashing then-President George W. Bush. I have used a variation of that title for more than 15 years to respond to performers who sound off on politics,” Ingraham said. .”.. If pro athletes and entertainers want to freelance as political pundits, then they should not be surprised when they’re called out for insulting politicians. There was no racial intent in my remarks ― false, defamatory charges of racism are a transparent attempt to immunize entertainment and sports elites from scrutiny and criticism.”</p>

Sports">
<p>Every four years, one winter sport in particular manages to capture the international zeitgeist for the briefest of moments before disappearing into obscurity until the next Olympics. Nestled in between events that require athletes to hurl themselves from the tops of mountains and launch themselves into the air with blades attached to their feet, curling functions as a mental reprieve for those of us who are more athletically challenged.</p>
<p>There’s something wonderfully ordinary about men and women of varying levels of fitness playing glorified shuffleboard on ice. However, as comparatively undemanding as curling is on the body, the same cannot be said for the curling stones themselves.</p>
<p>It turns out there are very few types of rock in existence that can withstand the stress of gliding along melting ice and smashing into more rock. Most granite is too quartz-rich for it to withstand the impact under curling conditions, which is what makes the granite found on a tiny deserted island off the Scottish coast so special.</p>
<p> Ailsa Craig is 10 miles west of mainland Scotland – and while it was once inhabited by Catholics who sought refuge during the Scottish Reformation, it is now an unpopulated safe haven for various birds and serves as the world’s only source for the rare granite that is used to make Olympic curling stones. Also known as “Paddy’s milestone,” the island is actually a volcanic plug – a literal rock formed over an extinct volcano. And it turns out that the unique makeup of the rock left behind is uniquely suited for making curling stones. There are three subgroups of the water-resistant microgranite that can can be mined from the island: Ailsa Craig Common Green Granite, Ailsa Craig Blue Hone Granite and Ailsa Craig Red Hone Granite. Kays of Scotland has been making curling stones since 1851 and has the exclusive rights to the Ailsa Craig granite, which is why it has provided the stones for every single competition at the Olympic Winter Games. About every 10 years, Kays extracts several thousand tons of the distinctive blue and green varieties. The blue hone, whose tight molecular structure makes it impervious to water and melting ice, is used for the insert and running band of the stone, while the green granite makes up the body.

<p>It’s about time.</p>
<p>John-Henry Krueger won silver Saturday at the Winter Olympics to capture the United States’ first individual speedskating medal since 2010.</p>
<p>Krueger and ultimate gold medalist Samuel Girard of Canada were the only competitors left standing in the men’s 1,000-meter short-track final after a crash temporarily wiped out the rest of the field.</p>
<p>The American skater hadn’t even qualified for the 2014 Games in Sochi after he got hit with the swine flu at the Olympic trials, which made his medal in these games even sweeter.</p>
<p>“It’s the ultimate redemption,” Krueger told NBC. “I’m finally able to put away the story about how I was a young kid who had swine flu and ended up missing the Olympics. Now I’m the young kid from Pittsburgh who came back from adversity and who ended up being the top in the world.”</p>
<p>See the replay of the race here.</p>
<p>Krueger appeared to have been eliminated in a quarterfinal heat, but officials ruled that an opponent, Sjinkie Knegt, had pushed him. So Krueger advanced and later was able to raise the American flag in celebration.</p>
<p>Seo Yira of South Korea got up from the crash on Saturday to take the bronze.</p>

<p>The real Nathan Chen finally arrived at the 2018 Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>After falling (quite miserably) to 17th place after the team men’s short program and earlier individual events, the two-time U.S. champion figure skater redeemed himself with a history-making men’s free skate performance on Saturday.</p>
<p>Chen, 18, landed a historic five clean quadruple jumps during his long program on Saturday. In an additional quad flip ― he had originally planned for only five ― Chen placed his hand on the ice. The graceful and powerful performance earned him a personal best score of 215.08, raising his final score to 297.35.</p>
<p>While he lost his chance at a medal, Chen’s six-quad attempt still made him the first Olympian to land even five quads cleanly in a routine.</p>
<p>“I did the best that I could after what happened in the short program, and I think what happened in the short program allowed me to take the pressure off myself and just enjoy myself here,” Chen told NBC after the event.</p>
<p>When asked why he attempted six quads after a disappointing week, Chen replied: “I already fell so many times, I might as well go out, throw everything down and see what happens.”</p>
<p>His comeback impressed many veteran figure skaters, including announcers Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski, and 1992 Olympic gold medalist Kristi Yamaguchi.</p>
<p>“What?!?!?!” Yamaguchi tweeted after Chen’s show. “Completely inhuman display of ridiculousness!!!”</p>
<p>She included her own “chicken scratch” scorecard in the tweet.</p>
<p>Chen was breaking records way before the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>He became the first U.S. male skater to land two quad jumps in a short program and four quad jumps in the free skate event at the 2016 U.S. Figure Skating Championship. Chen broke similar records the following year by landing two quad jumps in the short program and five quad jumps in a free skate performance at the 2017 U.S. Championship.</p>
<p>Welcome back, Chen!</p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - A South Korean province is considering a proposal to co-host the 2021 Asian Winter Games with North Korea in a bid to strengthen inter-Korean ties, South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency said on Saturday, quoting provincial governor Choi Moon-soon.</p>
<p>Gangwon province, host for the current 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, is considering the idea also as a way of making further use of Olympics venues, Choi was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>North Korea is participating in the Pyeongchang Games at the invitation of the South, which is using them to help ease tensions between the two countries, still technically at war. The host city for the 2021 event has not been decided yet.</p>
<p>A spokesman for South Korea’s sports ministry said it “hopes to continue sports exchanges with North Korea after the Winter Games” but it had not yet discussed any bid for the 2021 Games.</p>
<p>South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who held talks with top North Korean officials at Pyeongchang at the start of the Games, said on Saturday there was also a growing understanding of the need for talks between the United States and North Korea.</p>
<p>Washington has been pursuing a policy of isolating North Korea and exerting maximum pressure on the reclusive state to persuade it to drop its nuclear and missile weapons program.</p>
<p>“Talks between South and North Korea are making significant progress ... Meanwhile, a shared understanding of holding talks between the United States and North Korea is growing,” Moon told reporters in Pyeongchang.</p>
<p>″(I) hope the inter-Korean talks could lead to talks between the U.S. and North Korea and also denuclearisation talks.”</p>
<p>Last week, Moon met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, who delivered an invitation for Moon to attend a summit in North Korea “at an early date”.</p>
<p>Moon said it was premature to talk about when a summit could take place. “There is a high expectation of an inter-Korean summit, but people seem to be getting a bit ahead of themselves,” he added.</p>
<p>About the possibility of co-hosting the 2021 Asian Winter Games, the Gangwon governor said he would start mapping out details once the Olympic Games end and that the proposal would also utilize North Korea’s Masikryong ski resort.</p>
<p>Prior to the Winter Olympics, the two Koreas held a joint training program at the Masikryong resort.</p>
<p>The proposal, if put forward, would need approval from South Korea’s unification ministry.</p>
<p>A unification ministry spokeswoman said it had no immediate comment. Choi could not be immediately reached for comment, but his office said the issue had not been discussed and was the governor’s personal opinion.</p>

<p>U.S. speedskater Maame Biney finished last in her 1,500-meter short-track heat on Saturday, ending her trailblazing run at the Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old Biney is the first black woman on the U.S. Olympic short-track team ― and indeed the first black woman to make either Team USA Olympic speedskating squad. She qualified for the games before long-track racer Erin Jackson, who is also black.</p>
<p>“I am super honored to be able to be part of this, because I know that us African-American girls and women haven’t been able to be in this situation before,” Biney told HuffPost before the Pyeongchang Games. “I’m really honored to inspire other women, African-American or any other race, to get out there and do what you can and succeed.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, Biney briefly took the lead early in the race but then faded out of contention. (Leslie Jones of “Saturday Night Live” posted footage of the heat, below.)</p>
<p>The American athlete finished in a time of 2 minutes, 31.819 seconds in the field of six ― nearly two seconds behind the third and last qualifier from the heat, Valerie Maltais of Canada.</p>
<p>In her stronger event earlier in the games, the 500-meter, Biney advanced out of the preliminary heats, but could not overcome a slow start in her quarterfinal on Tuesday.</p>

<p>No miracles. Just meh.</p>
<p>The United States men’s hockey team couldn’t get by Russia’s 6-foot-7 goalie Vasily Koshechkin in a 4-0 loss on Saturday at the Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>The Americans (1-2) now must play an elimination game on Tuesday to make the quarterfinals. The Russians (2-1), technically the Olympic Athletes From Russia, have earned an automatic bye.</p>
<p>This year’s competition does not include current NHL players ― after they had appeared in five previous Olympics ― but one former league star figured largely in the scoring for Russia. Ilya Kovalchuk, who had 417 career goals in the NHL, made two goals after Nikolai Prokhorkin notched the first two for their team. (Watch the scoring highlights here.)</p>
<p>Koshechkin stopped 29 shots to help the Russians turn this game of rivals into a rout.</p>
<p>“I think it was a learning experience for us,” U.S. Coach Tony Granato told NBC afterward.</p>
<p>In the years since the Americans triumphed in the “Miracle on Ice” at the 1980 Games, the Russians have built a record of 4-1-1 in their Olympic series, Reuters noted.</p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea, Feb 17 (Reuters) ― Czech Ester Ledecka produced one of the biggest shocks in the history of the Winter Olympics when she tore down Jeongseon slope in bib number 26 to stun the pre-race favorites and win the women’s super-G on Saturday.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old was ranked 43rd in the World Cup standings in Super-G and was thought to have a better chance of gold in the snowboarding events she will also contest in Pyeongchang, an unprecedented doubling up.</p>
<p>Bib 26 was the starting position for a racer with only the slimmest chance of getting near the podium and the top contenders clearly thought the medals had been decided by skiers in the top 20 spots.</p>
<p>When Ledecka started her run, Austrian Anna Veith was at the bottom of the slope taking phone calls and preparing to celebrate becoming first woman to win back-to-back titles in the Olympic super-G.</p>
<p>The Czech’s run appeared at par with her starting position until halfway down the course but she carved up the bottom of the run to clock one minute 21.11 seconds.</p>
<p>Ledecka could barely believe it herself when the green light indicated she had bumped Veith out of the gold medal position by one hundredth of a second to give her country its first Alpine skiing gold medal.</p>
<p>“I was wondering what just happened. Is this a kind of mistake?,” she said.</p>
<p>”I was thinking okay they’re going to change the time, I‘m going to wait for a little bit and they’re going to switch and put some seconds on.</p>
<p>“I was just staring at the board and nothing was happening and everybody was screaming. I just started to think okay, this is weird.”</p>
<p>Veith’s time of 1.21.12 was only enough for silver, while Liechtenstein’s Tina Weirather claimed bronze in 1:21.22 after she had earlier edged Swiss Lara Gut off the top of the timesheets by the slenderest of margins in a thrilling race.</p>
<p>“I thought I had gold,” Veith said. “For me it was a big surprise that she could do this. At first I thought ’is this a mistake? But I want to congratulate her because she did a really good run.”</p>
<p>Despite a delay of an hour because of high winds, the race got underway under bright blue skies with a big crowd packed into the stands at the Jeongseon Alpine Centre.</p>
<p>American Lindsey Vonn went out first but made a mistake before the final jump and skied into soft snow for a time that was only good enough for sixth.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old will have another chance to become the oldest female medallist in Olympic Alpine skiing in her favoured downhill on the same mountain next week.</p>
<p>While Vonn is the second most decorated woman on the Alpine World Cup circuit with 81 victories, Ledecka has never even graced the podium on the circuit while she split her time with her snowboarding career.</p>
<p>World champion in the parallel giant slalom snowboarding and silver medallist at the last world championships in the parallel slalom, she could yet enjoy unprecedented medal success in the two separate snow sports.</p>
<p>“I was probably the only snowboarder on site,” Ledecka said when asked how she had managed to go so fast.</p>
<p>“All the other girls didn’t risk a lot. There must be a lot of pressure on them. I was just trying to do my best run.”</p>

<p>Don’t worry, Winnie the Pooh is not “dead.”</p>
<p>British author A.A. Milne’s lovable fictional bear began trending worldwide on Twitter early Saturday, but for a heartwarming Winter Olympics-related reason.</p>
<p>Each time Japan’s figure skating star, Yuzuru Hanyu, concludes a routine, his fans throw their replica golden bears into the rink. It was no different after he scooped a gold medal in the men’s individual figure skating event at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>The practice reportedly began back in 2010 after fans spotted Hanyu carrying a Pooh-themed tissue box cover. Per The New York Times, the bear has now become Hanyu’s lucky mascot. As for the dozens of toys that rained down onto the ice in Pyeongchang, they will be donated to local charities.</p>

<p>American alpine skier Lindsey Vonn sent a message to the internet trolls who bombarded her with abuse after she missed out on a Winter Olympics medal on Saturday.</p>
<p>Trolls, including some of President Donald Trump’s supporters, tweeted hateful messages at the 33-year-old four-time Olympian after she placed sixth in the women’s super-G event. Their comments were in apparent retaliation for Vonn’s criticism of Trump last month.</p>
<p>Julie Foudy, the former U.S. women’s national soccer team captain, spotted the offensive tweets and shared this message of support for Vonn:</p>
<p>Vonn replied that “not everyone has to like me but my family loves me and I sleep well at night.”</p>
<p>“I work hard and try to be the best person I can be,” Vonn added. “If they don’t like me, their loss I guess.”</p>
<p>Vonn won two medals, a gold and a bronze, at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada. A knee injury prevented her from competing at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.</p>
<p>Her measured response to the critics earned plenty of praise:</p>
<p>Vonn said it was “frustrating” to lose out in the super-G event, but she was “proud of the way” she “attacked the course.” Czech athlete Ester Ledecka won a surprise gold.</p>
<p>Vonn still has another shot at glory in the downhill and alpine combined events.</p>

<p>U.S. figure skater Nathan Chen is falling short of the hype ― and just plain falling at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>The 18-year-old two-time U.S. champion struggled again on Friday, tumbling to 17th place in the men’s short program.</p>
<p>He crashed on a quad lutz, stepped out of a quad toeloop and stumbled on a triple axel, placing his hand on the ice, Reuters noted.</p>
<p> “I’m upset, obviously,” he said. “There’s nothing to do but move on from here.”</p>
<p>NBC commentator Tara Lipinski said Chen looked “nervous and tentative.”</p>
<p>In his Olympics debut last week, Chen also fell and made other mistakes during the team event. He said he had “let the team down.” TV commentator Johnny Weir called his short program the worst he had seen from Chen. The Americans eventually earned a bronze medal.</p>
<p>Chen competes in the free skating on Saturday for perhaps a measure of redemption. But American teammates Adam Rippon (7th place) and Vincent Zhou (12th) are closer in the medal hunt.</p>

<p>https://twitter.com/usatodaysports/status/964313929571762185PYEONGCHANG, South Korea - Two Swiss freestyle skiers have contracted the norovirus, the Swiss team said on Friday, becoming the first confirmed cases among athletes at the Pyeongchang Winter Games.</p>
<p>A Swiss team spokesperson said one of athletes was Fabian Boesch but not want to name the other as the athlete’s relatives had not yet been informed.</p>
<p>Boesch had become an internet sensation at the Games after posting a video of himself hanging onto the outside rail of an escalator as it climbed upward.</p>
<p> “Everyone else is safe. We did everything we could. We took them away from the rest of the team and now they have to recover,” the spokesperson told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Games have been hit by an outbreak of the virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea but until Friday the athletic delegations had been unaffected.</p>
<p>More than 200 people have been confirmed to have contracted the norovirus, most of them security staff and Games personnel.</p>
<p>The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said earlier on Friday the two skiers were not staying at the athletes village with the majority of the other competitors in South Korea.</p>
<p>It said at a news conference they were “unwell” but hoped they would still be able to compete at the Games.</p>
<p>The freestyle competition started on Feb. 9 and runs until Feb. 23.</p>

<p>Pita Taufatofua, best known as Tonga’s shirtless Olympic flag bearer, hit the slopes Friday for the first time in the Pyeongchang Games. </p>
<p>He finished in 114th place in the 15km cross-country skiing event, taking 56:41.1 to complete the course. Two skiers finished behind him, two didn’t finish and one was disqualified. </p>
<p>Luckily, the disappointment will likely not sting too badly given that he had set a pretty low bar for himself to begin with.</p>
<p>“The first step, finish before they turn the lights off; that’s number one,” the 34-year-old joked Wednesday during a press conference. “Don’t ski into a tree, that’s number two.”</p>
<p>He had also only experienced snow for a total of 12 weeks throughout his entire life before this year’s Games, he added. He said he hoped his performance would inspire other young people from his home country.</p>
<p>“People from the Pacific, these kids who are watching now, they’ll have access to something that they never knew existed before,” he said. “And to me, that’s why I’m here.”</p>
<p>Taufatofua competed in the taekwondo event at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics and suggested on Thursday that he might try yet another sport for future Games.</p>
<p>“Maybe water’s the next thing,” he said. “Something in the water. Stay tuned.”</p>

<p>NEW YORK – It has been five months since the FBI arrested 10 men in a sweeping federal probe into the underbelly of the basketball world. As the three ongoing criminal cases resulting from the investigation plod along, it’s increasingly unlikely there will be another wave of double-digit arrests.</p>
<p>More legal charges still could come, but what’s becoming increasingly clear as the discovery portion of the case comes to a close is that the breadth of potential NCAA rules violations uncovered is wide enough to fundamentally and indelibly alter the sport of college basketball.</p>
<p>The soundtrack to the three federal basketball corruption cases is essentially a ticking time bomb, which will inevitably explode. It will impact every major conference, Hall of Fame coaches, a score of current top players and some of the nation’s most distinguished and respected programs.</p>
<p>Multiple sources who’ve been briefed on the case and are familiar with the material obtained by feds told Yahoo Sports that the impact on the sport will be substantial and relentless. Sitting under protective order right now are the fruits of 330 days of monitoring activity by the feds, which one assistant US Attorney noted Thursday was “a voluminous amount of material.” That includes wiretaps from 4,000 intercepted calls and thousands of documents and bank records obtained from raids and confiscated computers, including those from notorious NBA agent Andy Miller.</p>
<p>“This goes a lot deeper in college basketball than four corrupt assistant coaches,” said a source who has been briefed on the details of the case. “When this all comes out, Hall of Fame coaches should be scared, lottery picks won’t be eligible to play and almost half of the 16 teams the NCAA showed on its initial NCAA tournament show this weekend should worry about their appearance being vacated.”</p>
<p>There’s a general expectation that this information will be released. It could come in trial, pre-trial motions or released by the government at some point. (No one is certain if they’ve agreed to eventually give it to the NCAA if it doesn’t go public.)</p>
<p>So how bad could be it? In terms of NCAA rules, multiple sources told Yahoo Sports that the material obtained threatens the fundamental structure and integrity of the sport, as there’s potentially as many 50 college basketball programs that could end up compromised in some way.</p>
<p>Among the documents expected to be in the federal government’s protection are the bank records of Miller, who bankrolled middle man, Christian Dawkins, who is at the center of two of the cases.</p>
<p>“If the NCAA is going to get Andy Miller’s bank records, God bless them, I don’t know what they’re going to do,” said another source with direct knowledge of the situation, chuckling at the thought. “You are better off changing the rules. The crazy part of this business is none of the kids are free.”</p>
<p>NCAA officials are staring at the prospect of a tournament with a winner that will likely be vacating its title – and many others eventually vacating their appearances. There’s a lingering mushroom cloud over the sport’s upcoming showcase event that won’t go away. The most fascinating and tricky variable here is time.</p>
<p>There’s a protective order on the evidence found in discovery in all three cases. Whether the information gets out in dribs and drabs or released at once, the consequences are expected to be severe.</p>
<p>The government is not compelled to release the information, according to Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York who now teaches at Columbia Law School. “Sometimes never,” he said when asked generally about the timing of the release of information under protective order. He added: “The main sources of release will be in the course of pretrial motions and trial, and/or as related investigations go overt.” </p>
<p> What’s certain is that there’s enough compromising information to rock the sport to its core. There will be thousands of pages of documents, hundreds of hours of wiretaps with the voices of prominent coaches brokering deals with the middlemen, sneaker executives and talent traffickers. Will it trickle out? Or get released all at once? That’s complicated and procedural. The NCAA’s involvement in this case so far has been minimal. They’ve been in consistent contact with the federal investigators, careful to respect the boundaries of the criminal investigations. Whenever the information is released from under protective order, the NCAA will have to continue to respect the boundaries of the criminal investigations as they begin their own. Miller’s financial activity is expected to compromise dozens of programs and players, but he certainly wasn’t a rogue agent. Rather, Miller was jockeying for clients in a competitive field where agents consistently exhibited similar behavior. (Miller did not return a call seeking comment.) The routine nature of agents, runners and financial advisors operating in a world rife with payoffs, bag drops and kickbacks leaves the federal investigators at a fascinating crossroads. “The biggest mystery in this case is why more high-profile coaches and agents haven’t been brought in,” said the source who has been briefed on the case. As witnesses paint a picture of the depths of corruption in the basketball underworld, the feds need to make a decision whether they want to expose other sneaker companies, agents and coaches. So far, there’s been no indication that they’re prepared to do that. The basketball underworld is sophisticated and nuanced, a black market forged over decades of moving players. Even with all the wiretaps and documents, the feds are still catching up on how it all worked. “The craziest part of it all is that they could have walked into one of 15 agent’s offices and it’s just as bad,” said a source with direct knowledge of the situation. “It just would have been other people and other schools.” There had been a flurry of activity in the case in the past week that had conjured some optimism for the defense attorneys. A Wall Street Journal report about an undercover FBI agent under investigation and a motion filed revealing a paperwork error appeared to poke some holes in the case. Those matters will ultimately have to be addressed, but any momentum for the defense attorneys was abruptly and tersely halted Thursday morning. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, presiding on the 26th floor of the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse in lower Manhattan, denied a motion to dismiss one of the cases with the legal equivalent of a Dikembe Mutombo finger wag after a blocked shot. Lawyers for three of the defendants – Adidas executives Merl Code and Jim Gatto and business manager Christian Dawkins – had filed for a motion to dismiss the cases based essentially on the notion that the universities in the cases couldn’t be considered victims. They were, after all, benefitting from the players and their performances on the court. As Kaplan listened impatiently to Gatto’s lawyer, Michael S. Schachter, argue the motion, the judge’s mood vacillated between annoyed and ornery. His reactions to Schachter’s arguments included, “it would be quite a stretch,” “are you kidding me?” and “I’ve actually read the indictment.” He made one jab about the media attention the case has generated and ultimately dismissed the motion by saying that Schachter’s arguments would be better heard by a jury. (Schachter declined comment.) The trial for that case will begin on Oct. 1, and the case involving former Auburn assistant Chuck Person and clothier Rashan Michel starts on Feb. 4 of 2019. (Another judge set the date for the third case – which includes the other three assistant coaches – for April 22.) Until then, the NCAA tournament will be played amid the soundtrack – TICK, TICK, TICK – of potential chaos. Maybe the next one will, too. University presidents should be losing sleep. Millionaire coaches should be losing hair and plotting escapes to the NBA. And players should be preparing for their dirty laundry – or that of their relatives – to be aired. What would happen if the information under protective order were to be released before the NCAA selection show on March 11? A source who has been briefed on the case laughed: “You might see Tennessee-Chattanooga as a No. 2 seed.” Read more from Yahoo Sports:   A world away, U.S. tragedy brings tears to Olympics   Isaiah Thomas: Rondo scuffle was about Celtics beef   Radio host fired for ugly comment about underage Olympian   This story was originally published on Yahoo News. </p>

<p>The 2018 Winter Games in Pyongchang, South Korea, is making the fight against sexual assault a higher priority than ever before at the games, unveiling four support centers providing resources for victims in a myriad of languages.</p>
<p>The centers stem from a recommendation following the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro that each Olympic Games create ways to safeguard workers and spectators, the International Olympic Committee told HuffPost in a statement.</p>
<p>Pyeongchang’s Organizing Committee decided to create spaces, mainly in spectator areas that are near police outposts. These centers cater to the Olympics workforce and ticket holders ― groups that have been reportedly subjected to sexual violence during past Olympics.</p>
<p>For athletes, medical clinics are equipped with a team of 10 psychologists and psychiatrists prepared to respond to any complaints of abuse, Susan Greinig, the IOC’s safeguarding officer, said at a news conference last week.</p>
<p>Jeon Won Hee, who has been manning one of the four centers, called the initiative “symbolic.”</p>
<p>“This is very meaningful, but the more important thing is knowing that sexual violence can occur anywhere at any time,” she told NBC News.</p>
<p>Gangwon-do, the province that includes Pyeongchang, provided funding for the centers, Mic reported. They’re open eight hours a day, with a phone hotline available in 13 languages at night. </p>
<p>“If something happens, we want to provide emergency counseling, medical and legal support,” said Kwon Eun-jin, head of women’s welfare for the province.</p>
<p>The IOC committed to enhancing gender equality in 2017, undertaking a comprehensive review across the organization. Based on the findings, a pilot program aiming to establish a balanced portrayal of both genders is underway in Pyeongchang, the organization said.</p>
<p>Greinig said the IOC has been working to prevent harassment and abuse for several years. For the Rio Olympics, she noted, the IOC implemented hotlines for reporting abuse and launched a safeguarding program in which an officer was available to field complaints.</p>
<p>The fact that sexual activity goes hand in hand with high-stakes athletic competition is no secret. U.S. figure skater Adam Rippon, for example, openly commented on the condom selection in Pyongchang over the weekend. </p>
<p>But the Olympics brings together people from different cultures who hold various perspectives on appropriate behavior, said Kristen Dieffenbach, associate professor of athletic coaching education at West Virginia University and an executive board member for the Association for Applied Sport Psychology.</p>
<p>Some “make a big deal of young girls, there’s an enthusiastic party culture,” Diffenbach noted. “There are teams that stay away from the Olympic Village for that reason. It’s very analogous to the first week of college, or spring break week.”</p>
<p>Sexual violence has affected Olympic athletes for years. Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor, was sentenced to prison this month for sexually abusing hundreds of young athletes, including Olympic medalists.</p>
<p>“Sport’s an odd place fraught with some of the nuances of abuse,” Dieffenbach said. “You have a whole realm of issues related to just the power dynamic and what constitutes abuse, is it screaming at an athlete, pushing them to be their best? There are a lot of people who would debate where that line is.”</p>
<p>Yet the reckoning that has held abusers to account has only taken off in recent months, propelled by the #MeToo movement.</p>
<p>“MeToo allowed us all to see that it’s not the victim’s fault, being sexually harassed,” said Sungsook Kim, a Catholic nun who runs one of the Olympic Village centers. “It gives courage to the victims.” </p>

<p>Austria’s Markus Schairer suffered a broken neck after a terrifying crash during the men’s snowboardcross quarterfinals at the Winter Olympics on Thursday.</p>
<p>Schairer fractured his fifth cervical vertebra. Video of the fall shows the 30-year-old landing flat on his back after a jump toward the end of the course. His goggles flew off his helmet as he lay on the ground. </p>
<p>According to a statement from the Austrian Olympic Committee, doctors believed Schairer had escaped serious permanent damage and showed no neurological impairments after the crash.</p>
<p>The athlete, who also competed at the Vancouver and Sochi Olympics, managed to stand up and ride to the end of the course after his horrific fall. He was in fourth place at the time of the crash. </p>
<p>Earlier this week during the men’s halfpipe competition, 16-year-old snowboarder Yuto Totsuka of Japan also suffered a gruesome-looking fall and had to be taken off the course in a stretcher. Officials said he did not suffer any serious injury from the crash, and Totsuka later posted on Instagram that he was OK.</p>

<p>Team USA snowboarder Lindsey Jacobellis on Friday just barely missed the chance to take a place at the podium during her fourth Winter Olympics. </p>
<p>The veteran athlete missed a bronze medal by 0.03 seconds in the snowboarding cross final. She trailed gold medalist Michela Moioli by a mere 0.46 seconds.</p>
<p>She led at the start to the midway point but was later thrown off by a crashing rider, NBC reports. </p>
<p>Jacobellis, 32, won a silver in 2006 but a showboat move caused her to fall and give up a huge lead ― and the gold. She was then disqualified in the semifinals in 2010 and crashed in the semis in 2014.</p>
<p>Away from the Olympics, she has had a stellar career, earning 10 golds at the X Games and five world championships. </p>
<p>But another Olympic letdown (see video of the race here) didn’t seem to get her down too much.</p>

<p>Mikaela Shiffrin, hoping to make history as the first skier to win back-to-back Olympic golds, finished fourth in the women’s slalom on Friday.</p>
<p>Following frustrating delays and her gold medal run in the giant slalom on Thursday, Shiffrin was seen throwing up just before entering the gate for her first run. She told NBC at the bottom of the hill that the sickness came on suddenly and “felt more like a virus-kind of puking, less about nerves.”</p>
<p>The norovirus has been been whipping its way across the Pyeongchang Olympic Games, felling staff and volunteers, with 244 reported cases as of Thursday. The Swiss team confirmed Friday that two of its skiers had contracted the virus, becoming the first athletes to be affected at the Games. </p>
<p>It’s rare for Shiffrin to miss the podium entirely. Slalom is considered her best event and the competition she won gold in at the 2014 Sochi Games. NBC News reported that since Sochi, she had made the podium 34 times in world events, missing it only a handful of times. </p>
<p>Frida Hansdotter of Sweden took gold, who said it “was nice to beat [Shiffin] for once, since she’s been beating me for so long.” Switzerland’s Wendy Holdener won silver and Austria’s Katharina Gallhuber took the bronze medal.</p>

<p>Spain scooped up its first Winter Olympics medal since 1992 on Thursday.</p>

<p>The sportscaster couldn’t contain his excitement about his countryman’s historic performance in video that his Eurosport colleague Fernando Ruiz shared online (see above).</p>
<p>As the race reached its thrilling conclusion, Hernández Tallada jumped up and down and punched the air inside the studio where he was watching a livestream of the games. The video has since gone viral.</p>
<p>Prior to Hernández Martín’s medal-winning run, Spain last ascended the podium at a Winter Olympics some 26 years ago in Albertville, France, when Blanca Fernández Ochoa secured the third spot in the women’s Alpine skiing event.</p>

<p>U.S. figure skater Adam Rippon nailed his routine in the men’s short program at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Friday, landing four jumps.</p>
<p>It was a solid performance by one of the breakout stars of the Games, and when he was asked by a reporter after his routine exactly why he’d been skating so well the past few days, he fired back with the fierce wit he has quickly come to be known by.</p>
<p>“You’re 28 years old, skating the best you ever have in your life. How do you explain that to people?” the skater was asked by NBC’s Andrea Joyce.</p>
<p>“I can’t explain witchcraft,” Rippon, with tongue in cheek, replied. </p>
<p>While he didn’t land in the top three during Friday’s event, Rippon has already taken home a medal. He won a bronze earlier this week in the figure skating team competition and has been a media darling both on and off the ice. He’s spoken about his battle with an eating disorder, shared his opinions on the Olympic condoms and bonded with actress Reese Witherspoon.</p>
<p>Social media lit up after Rippon’s witchy retort. </p>

<p>Cooper later insisted her remark had been misinterpreted, and said she was only talking about Chinese athletes’ similar technical styles:</p>
<p>“I need to make it clear I was talking about the jump,” Cooper tweeted. “The Chinese are trained by one coach with one technique, their aim is all to jump the same.”</p>
<p>Channel 7 also issued a statement defending Cooper’s remark. “At no time was the commentary racist, intended to be racist or offensive,” the network said.</p>

<p>Utah Jazz guard Donovan Mitchell sent a powerful message about gun violence during his team’s Wednesday night win over the Phoenix Suns.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old NBA player inked two messages onto his shoes in response to the horrific mass shooting hours earlier at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.</p>
<p>Mitchell wrote “End Gun Violence” on the side of his right shoe:</p>
<p>And on his left shoe, he penned, “Pray for Parkland.”</p>
<p>After the game, Mitchell explained to reporters why the shooting prompted him to take a stand:</p>
<p> “My mom’s a schoolteacher. I was about 15, 20 minutes away during the Sandy Hook shooting. It’s kind of scary. I’m not saying all shootings make me feel the same way, but especially school shootings, with my mom being a nursery teacher, it’s kind of scary that that could happen at any moment, anywhere.” </p>
<p>Mitchell also called for “something” to be done about gun violence in the U.S.</p>
<p>“A lot of people, we talk about it, and there’s a lot of so-called awareness of it, but there’s nothing being done,” he said. “It’s interesting how it just continues to happen, and the movement doesn’t do much,” he added.</p>

<p>A lawyer representing the woman who settled a sexual harassment lawsuit with Olympic snowboarder Shaun White last year called out the athlete for minimizing sexual harassment on the world stage. </p>
<p>In a statement provided to USA Today, Lena Zawaideh’s attorney Lawrance Bohm said White’s comments were damaging to his client’s character. </p>
<p>“Mr White’s comments, on the world stage, directly impugn the character of Ms. Zawaideh,” he wrote. “No woman wants to be called a ‘gossip’ or liar by the harasser.” </p>
<p>The sexual harassment allegations, which were first filed in a 2016 lawsuit, resurfaced this week as White’s quest for a history-making gold medal in Pyeongchang heated up. NBC, the official broadcaster of the Winter Olympics in the U.S., repeatedly referred to him in promotional materials as “the best of the U.S,” prompting Slate to wonder why the network had been mum on the allegations.</p>
<p>Following his win on Wednesday, White was asked about the allegations during a news conference and dismissed them as “gossip.” He later walked back his comment, saying it was “a poor choice of words to describe such a sensitive subject in the world today.”</p>
<p>Zawaideh, a former bandmate, accused White of repeatedly sexually harassing her and sending her lewd text messages.</p>
<p>Her lawyer seemingly referenced NBC’s continued praise of White by referencing the tagline. “Hopefully, before our country declares someone ‘the best of the U.S.,’ there will be investigation and due diligence.” </p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG (Reuters) - American Mikaela Shiffrin put on a show of grace, power and consistency to win her first gold medal of the Pyeongchang Olympics in the women’s giant slalom on Thursday.</p>
<p>With all the top 30 having completed their second runs and a huge margin separating them from the rest of the field, the 22-year-old was assured of victory, with Norway’s Ragnhild Mowinckel taking silver and Italy’s Federica Brignone bronze.</p>
<p>After days of frustrating weather delays, it was the perfect start for Shiffrin, who won the slalom in Sochi four years ago and could compete in four or five more events here.</p>
<p>In a contest of sharply fluctuating fortunes between the morning and afternoon runs, her placings of second and fourth-fastest gave her a combined time of two minutes, 20.02 seconds, and a comfortable margin of 0.39 seconds over Mowinckel.</p>
<p>Italy’s Manuela Moelgg was the last of the top 30 to race, having beaten Shiffrin by 0.2 seconds in the morning, but she fumbled her chance of winning an Olympic gold at the age of 34 and finished the competition in eighth place.</p>
<p>Sweden’s Estelle Alphand posted the fastest afternoon time but was only 26th in the morning, leaving her 16th overall.</p>
<p>With many competitors struggling to avoid mistakes and several wiping out altogether on the steep 1,250 meters-long slope, with a vertical drop of 400 meters, Shiffrin was conspicuous by her smooth, attacking style and easy rhythm.</p>
<p>The giant slalom was the first women’s Alpine skiing race to take place at the Pyeongchang Games, after high winds forced it to be rescheduled from Monday and also caused Wednesday’s slalom to be postponed.</p>

<p>Sure, it was just a group-play match between the United States and Canada in women’s hockey at the Winter Olympics on Thursday in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>But intensity still ran high between the archrivals, culminating in the final frantic seconds in which the Americans tried to push across a goal. Then tempers flared.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, Canada hung on to win, 2-1. Both teams advanced to the semifinals.</p>
<p>The two North American neighbors are the giants of international women’s hockey. However, their Olympics history is a tad one-sided. After the Americans captured the first gold medal in 1998, Canada has won the last four. Thursday’s win gave Canada its fifth straight victory of late over Team USA.</p>
<p>Kendall Coyne scored the only U.S. goal early in the third period to cut Canada’s lead to 2-1. The U.S. outshot Canada 45-23 but Canadan goaltender Genevieve Lacasse made several key saves. She stopped a penalty shot by Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson in the second period.</p>
<p>The game ended with a determined effort by the U.S. to score but the Americans came up short. Not surprisingly, a scuffle broke out because, well, it’s U.S.-Canada.</p>
<p>The teams are heavy favorites to meet again in the final.</p>
<p>“Those are the fun ones,” U.S. forward Amanda Kessel said. “It’s what you live for. The intensity is there every single shift. You can’t take a second off.”</p>

Pyeongchang Exhibition Plants The Seed" date="2018-02-15" authors="Jay Busbee, Yahoo! Sports">
<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea—The volleyballs are flying high at Austria House, and the drinks are flowing. The music’s bumping a bass beat thick enough to rearrange internal organs, and the crowd throws up hands every time the DJ calls out MONSTER BLOCK or SUPER SLAM.</p>
<p>Oh, and it’s a balmy 35 degrees out. Perfect volleyball weather, right?</p>
<p>Beach volleyball has become one of the marquee events of the Summer Games, and now comes its snowy cousin with an eye on carving out a little slice of the wintertime sports pie. Snow volleyball isn’t anywhere near getting onto an Olympic slate, not even close, but at a demonstration event held on Valentine’s Day at the Austria House, within sight of the Olympic Sliding Centre, the energy was as high as almost any event this week.</p>
<p>The International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) and the European Volleyball Confederation (CEV) rounded up a handful of notable beach volleyballers: gold medalists Emanuel of Brazil, Vladimir Grbic of Serbia and Giba of Brazil, as well as bronze medalist Chen Xue of China and Olympians Stefanie Schwaiger of Austria, Kim Yeon-koung of South Korea, and Nikolas Berger of Austria. The Olympians threw on some thermals, gloves, and soccer cleats, and took a turn in the snow as perhaps a hundred fans around them cheered and danced.</p>
<p>“We like to play in the mountains, in the beach, outside, inside, with children, with men and women,” CEV president Aleksandr Boricic said after the demonstration. “With snow volleyball, we can cover volleyball every day of the year.”</p>
<p>The purpose of this little exhibition was to show snow volleyball’s viability as a sport, and on that score, it succeeded just fine. But as an Olympic entry? That’s where it gets a little trickier.</p>
<p>Snow volleyball demands a different set of skills than the beach version, starting with the fact that, well, you’re on snow. Attendants with rakes chopped the snow into a fine powder, but by the end of the match, the stomping players, and dropping temperatures, had pounded the snow into slick near-concrete.</p>
<p>The altitude is a factor, as is the cold. Players in most snow volleyball events — though not this particular one — close off with a celebratory dip in a hot tub, but before then, the lower oxygen can tire even the best players.</p>
<p>It’s because of these inescapable factors — plus unpredictable ones, like the high winds savaging the Olympic Village at the same time the volleyball beats were dropping — that organizers from the FIVB and the CEV were preaching baby steps rather than big-picture dreams, “innovation” and “possibility” rather than expectation.</p>
<p>“What we do believe is that snow volleyball is great, it’s about engagement,” Azevedo said. “We want people to be playing volleyball. The future, who knows?” </p>
<p>The earliest snow volleyball could realistically make the Olympic slate would be 2026, following a stint as a demonstration sport in the 2022 Games in Beijing. But even that is no sure thing; the IOC historically has sought to keep sports confined to one season. (An attempt to bring cross-country running to the Winter Games in 2008, for instance, went nowhere.) Snow volleyball does have both a strong organizing federation and a ready availability of Olympic-level players, but even those might not be enough to get snow volleyball onto the Olympic slate.</p>
<p>In the short term, snow volleyball’s backers are focusing on smaller steps: a European Tour kicked off in 2015, and European championships will take place later this year. FIVB hopes to start a world tour in 2019, to be followed by world championships in 2020. Beyond that, well … we’ll see.</p>

<p>Olympian-turned-NBC analyst Bode Miller caused controversy at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Thursday with his suggestion that Austrian skier Anna Veith’s performance at the games had been hurt by marriage.</p>
<p>Miller, who had been discussing Veith’s slow start in the ladies’ giant slalom event, later claimed his comment was “an ill-advised attempt at a joke.”</p>
<p>“The knee is certainly an issue,” said Miller, in reference to the anterior cruciate ligament injury that Veith, who won gold in the women’s super-G event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, sustained in 2016.</p>
<p>But Miller, a former alpine skier, then took a dumb turn:</p>
<p> “I want to point out she also got married. And it’s historically very challenging to race on the World Cup with a family or after being married. Not to blame the spouses, but I just want to toss that out there that it may be her husband’s fault.” </p>
<p>Listen to Miller’s commentary here:</p>
<p>Miller’s comments did not go over well on Twitter:</p>
<p>Five-time Olympian Miller later apologized on air for what he called his “ill-advised attempt at a joke” meant to highlight “how beneficial” marriage could be for an athlete.</p>
<p>“I know the support team you need. I relied on my friends and family. And if you have the luxury of relying on a spouse, I know they are inevitably your biggest supporter,” said Miller, per NBC.</p>
<p>“And on Valentine’s Day I didn’t mean to throw spouses under the bus,” he added. “Certainly, I’m going to be hearing it from my wife, I know.”</p>
<p>Miller later used Twitter in a bid to further clarify:</p>
<p>Veith, who tied the knot with retired Austrian snowboarder Manuel Veith in April 2016, ranked 12th in the ladies’ giant slalom event.</p>
<p>She is yet to compete in the downhill, super-G and alpine combined events.</p>

<p>American figure skater Alexa Scimeca-Knierim broke down in tears following her routine at the Winter Olympics final in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Wednesday, saying she and husband Chris Knierim skated for the victims of the Florida school shooting earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The couple, the only U.S. team among the 16 finalists in the pairs figure skating free skate competition, took to the ice mere hours after 17 children and staff were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, about 15 miles northwest of Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>“We wanted to skate for the 17 children that died in the Florida shooting. And today was much more than about us,” Scimeca-Knierim said in an interview following her performance, Time reported.</p>
<p>“We are so privileged and lucky to be doing what we are doing, and it’s so sad that 17 people died in the United States. I told Chris today he’d need to be so much stronger than me.”</p>
<p>The pair won bronze medals as part of the U.S. figure skating team event. On Wednesday, the pair scored 185.82 in the pairs competition, placing them toward the bottom of the field.</p>
<p>“I am disappointed with the way we performed today, but so many people at home are hurting because their children have died,” she said, according to The Associated Press.</p>
<p>“I was not focused on it while we were skating, but now that we are done, after we’ve skated, there’s an emotional hurt. I am overwhelmed.”</p>
<p>Scimeca-Knierim also published a tweet about the Florida shooting, sending sympathy to the victims and their families.</p>
<p>Her husband later retweeted it on his own Twitter account.</p>
<p>Despite saying they were affected by the sad news from back home, the pair managed to pull off an Olympic first, according to U.S. Figure Skating. </p>

<p>Participating in the Winter Olympics is what counts for Tonga’s flag bearer Pita Taufatofua.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old cross-country skier set himself an amusingly low bar for success during a press conference in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“The first step, finish before they turn the lights off; that’s number one,” the underdog athlete joked in a video that the Agence France-Presse shared online, above.</p>
<p>“Don’t ski into a tree, that’s number two,” added Taufatofua, who captured the world’s attention during Friday’s opening ceremony, where he wore a traditional Tongan ta’ovala waist mat as he marched with his country’s flag. He did the same at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympic games, where he competed in the taekwondo event and was knocked out in his first bout.</p>
<p>Taufatofua noted how he’d only had “12 weeks on snow in my whole life” and almost certainly “won’t medal,” before giving an inspirational explanation about why he’d decided to represent his country at the games:</p>
<p> “In four years, someone from Tonga might (medal). In eight years, someone from the Pacific might, but more importantly people from the Pacific, these kids who are watching now, they’ll have access to something that they never knew existed before. And to me, that’s why I’m here.” </p>
<p>Taufatofua articulated a similar sentiment earlier this week during an interview on NBC:</p>
<p>“Its not about winning medals for me,” he said. “It’s about inspiring people to push themselves out of their comfort zone, to not fear failure, to fail and then laugh at it and then try again.”</p>
<p>Taufatofua doesn’t make his Winter Olympic debut in the men’s 15km free event until Friday, but his participation at the games is already having a major impact back in his South Pacific homeland, which Cyclone Gita battered earlier this week.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, he revealed that International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach had “offered to help rebuild sporting facilities” in the country.</p>
<p>Taufatofua wrote on Facebook how it was “a dream” to “build an Olympic facility for the children of Tonga to one day have the privilege of being an Olympian and waving that flag.”</p>
<p>“After the cyclone we have nothing but now we have some hope,” he added.</p>

<p>Radio personality Patrick Connor is out of a job after he called Winter Olympics gold medalist Chloe Kim a “little hot piece of ass.”</p>
<p>Connor made the comment on Barstool Radio’s Sirius XM channel, but it was another of his employers, San Francisco radio station KNBR, that fired him Wednesday, news outlets reported. Connor hosted “The Shower Hour” at that station.</p>
<p>KNBR program director Jeremiah Crowe confirmed the parting to the San Jose Mercury News without elaborating.</p>
<p>Connor reportedly remained employed by Barstool.</p>
<p>Former Major League Baseball pitcher Dallas Braden, host of the new Sirius XM “Dialed-In” show on which Connor made his crass remarks Tuesday, said Barstool understands the “severity and the seriousness of the comments made ... and that’s not who we are,” according to USA Today.</p>
<p>Connor apologized on Twitter, calling his words “lame and gross.”</p>
<p>While the world celebrated 17-year-old Kim’s spectacular victory in the women’s halfpipe, Connor said in audio captured by Deadspin: “She’s fine as hell! If she was 18, you wouldn’t be ashamed to say that she’s a little hot piece of ass. And she is. She is adorable. I’m a huge Chloe Kim fan.”</p>
<p>In discussing Kim, Connor previously referenced a Matthew McConaughey line from “Dazed and Confused”: “That’s what I love about these high school girls. I get older, they stay the same age.”</p>

<p>Canadian figure-skating duo Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford went out in style at the Winter Olympics on Thursday.</p>
<p>The two cleanly landed the first throw quad salchow in Olympic history during the pairs free skate figure skating, NBC Sports reported.</p>
<p>The difficult maneuver enabled the two-time world champions to earn bronze as they presumably finished their Olympic careers.</p>
<p>Aliona Savchenko and Bruno Massot of Germany took gold with a record 159.31 points in the pairs free skate, and Sui Wenjing and Han Cong of China won silver.</p>
<p>Duhamel and Radford previously helped Canada win gold in the team event and took silver as part of the team competition at the Sochi Games.</p>
<p>Duhamel said their performances in Pyeongchang, South Korea, “just perfectly wrapped up my skating career and my skating journey. I feel so complete right now. I feel like I‘m going to be happy for the rest of my life.”</p>

<p>Things are heating up for Jamaica’s women bobsledders at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>The team’s German coach, former Olympic champion Sandra Kiriasis, has quit, just days before athletes Carrie Russell and Jazmine Fenlator-Victorian were due to compete in the women’s bobsleigh event.</p>
<p>Kiriasis is now threatening to take the team’s bobsled that she rented for the games, reports the BBC. The sled threat may jeopardize Russell and Fenlator-Victorian’s shot at becoming the Caribbean island’s first Olympic female bobsledders.</p>
<p>Kiriasis resigned Wednesday after the Jamaica Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation told her “out of the blue” that it had changed her position from driver coach to track and performance analyst, she wrote on Facebook.</p>
<p>“(I) would have to leave the Olympic village, would lose my accreditation as part of the Jamaican team and was not supposed to have any more contact with the athletes,” she said.</p>
<p>Kiriasis, 43, said she’d “supported the team far beyond the call of duty at all times” by securing sponsorship, equipment and the rented bobsled ― but she could not “accept to be treated the way I have been treated.”</p>
<p>“I still do not know the reasons behind the decision of Jamaican Bobsleigh Federation and certainly will not allow to be used as the puppet on a string by the federation which have also saved a lot of money due to my commitment and contacts,” she added.</p>
<p>The Jamaica Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation initially thanked Kiriasis on Twitter “for her invaluable contribution” to the team:</p>
<p>But the federation’s president, Christian Stokes, later escalated tensions by describing Kiriasis as “a destructive force on the team.”</p>
<p>“Now that she is off the team synergy is much better, tension is down and athletes are now able to focus in a much healthier environment,” Stokes told Reuters. “If you come on the team you have to be a team player. There are no gods and goddesses here,” he added.</p>
<p>Training for the women’s bobsleigh event in South Korea begins Saturday. The opening heats begin on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Team coach Dudley “Tal” Stokes — a member of Jamaica’s famous men’s bobsled team at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada, which inspired the hit movie “Cool Runnings” ― insisted that Fenlator-Victorian and Russell would still compete in Pyeongchang.</p>
<p>“For sure we’re going to be at the top of the hill for the start of the race and we’re going to have a good performance,” Stokes told Omnisport. </p>
<p>“What I can say is that we don’t expect there to be any changes in equipment going into the games,” Stokes added. “In the unlikely event that we do have a problem what I can guarantee is that on race day we’re going to be at the start with very competitive equipment and those girls will be ready to go.”</p>

<p>Preparing for the Olympics is tough enough as it is. But performing your routine and having the perfect Valentine’s Day gift to follow it up?</p>
<p>It was no problem for Chris Knierim and Alexa Scimeca Knierim, U.S figure skating pair and husband and wife. Following the couple’s short program routine, Chris had a huge teddy bear and a “Will you (still) be mine?” heart ready as the couple met with the media.</p>
<p>It’s been a busy and emotional Olympic Games for the couple, who started skating together in 2012 and got married in 2016. Chris and Alexa wound up as alternates for the 2014 Sochi games after Chris broke his tibia during the preceding season. Still, they were able to respond with a national championship in 2015. But in 2016, tragedy struck again when Alexa suffered from a rare and life-threatening gastrointestinal condition. She needed several surgeries and dropped to 80 pounds.</p>
<p>Luckily, these Olympics are proving the story ultimately has taken a very happy turn. After winning another national title in January 2018, the couple helped the United States earn the bronze medal in the team skate Monday and got to skate together on Valentine’s Day as part of the figure skating pairs competition.</p>
<p>There’s love on the ice in PyeongChang, and giant teddy bears as well.</p>

<p> Tongan flag bearer, after taekwondo and skiing, hints at third sport for Tokyo 2020  How Shaun White Enters The History Books With His Third Gold Medal   Russian gold-medal favorites lose opening game to Slovakia  </p>

<p>American snowboarder Shaun White has won Winter Olympics gold for a historic third time in the snowboarding halfpipe, besting the field in Pyeongchang with a phenomenal 97.75 score in his final run and becoming the first person to win a trio of gold medals in the sport.</p>
<p>White led the field after the first round, as judges gave his initial effort a 94.25 score, but Japanese snowboarder Ayumu Hirano edged to the front with a 95.25 in the second round.</p>
<p>In the last round, with the last run of the final, White managed to pull out a near-perfect run to steal gold. </p>
<p>Hirano scored the silver medal, while Australian snowboarder Scotty James won bronze.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old White is now on top of the all-time Olympic gold medal tally for snowboarding, which was introduced to the Winter Games in 1998, with wins at the 2006 Turin Games and the 2010 Vancouver Games in addition to his gold in Pyeongchang.</p>
<p>NBC has been celebrating White and his quest to make history with a third gold medal win, though the network was called out this week for failing to acknowledge that the athlete settled a sexual harassment suit in 2017.</p>
<p>Asked about the harassment allegations on Wednesday, White told reporters that, “I’m here to talk about the Olympics, not gossip and stuff.” </p>
<p>White joins fellow American Kelly Clark (who won a gold and two bronzes) on top of the overall medal tally for the sport. Both have three Olympic snowboarding medals each.</p>
<p>In another milestone, White’s win was the 100th gold won by U.S. athletes in the Winter Games. </p>
<p>It was also the fourth gold for the United States in Pyeongchang, with all four medals coming in snowboarding events. U.S. athletes have managed to claim golds in all the snowboarding competitions thus far, with Red Gerard and Jamie Anderson taking honors in men’s and women’s slopestyle, and Chloe Kim winning the women’s halfpipe. </p>
<p> After White’s disappointing showing at the 2014 Sochi Games and a scary practice fall that left him with 62 stitches on his face last October, he’s reclaimed his place on top of the snowboarding world after the phenomenal performance. The early signs pointed to a White win after he posted a 98.50 score on his second run in the qualifying rounds of the halfpipe on Tuesday. </p>
<p> “I started seeing everyone putting these great runs in and I figured I would step it up,” White told NBC Sports. “They motivated me to send it on that last one.”  He later tweeted that he had been looking forward to the final for four years, since his disappointing performance in Sochi, where he dropped out of the slopestyle competition and placed fourth in the halfpipe.  </p>

<p>Earlier this week, Twitter users decided that Kenworthy bore an uncanny resemblance to actor Richard Madden, aka Robb Stark in “Game of Thrones.”</p>
<p>Madden hasn’t commented, but Kenworthy responded lightheartedly to the comparison:</p>
<p>Kenworthy, who scooped silver at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia, will compete in the men’s ski slopestyle event on Sunday.</p>
<p>His reply sent his many of his 200,000 followers into a mini-meltdown:</p>

<p>A local sports anchor in Texas angered the Olympic figure skating community when he suggested that the event was “not a sport.”</p>
<p>Fox-4 Dallas’ reporter Edward Egros made the statement via Twitter on Monday as skaters were competing in this year’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>Egros claimed in a follow-up tweet that figure skating was “too subjective” to “have quantifiable metrics that determine a winner” and so was “an art form.”</p>
<p>“Still, figure skating is really hard,” he added.</p>
<p>Egros’ comments did not go over well with Winter Olympians, past and present.</p>
<p>Vincent Zhou, who at 17-years-old is Team USA’s youngest Olympian competing in this year’s games, told Egros to “stick to reporting on ‘real sports,’ do your job, and we’ll do ours.”</p>
<p>Zhou’s teammate Chris Knierim agreed:</p>
<p>Gracie Gold ― who helped Team USA score a bronze medal in the team skating event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia ― also waded in on the debate:</p>
<p>Retired Canadian figure skater Jeffrey Buttle, who nabbed bronze in the individual men’s event at the 2006 Turin games in Italy, also clapped back.</p>
<p>Egros appeared unfazed by the attention, however, and stuck to his guns:</p>

<p>Snowboarder Shaun White responded on Wednesday to sexual harassment allegations that resurfaced this week ahead of his winning performance in the halfpipe event at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>During a press conference held shortly after the snowboarder won his third career gold medal, White was asked about the allegations, which were first made public in a 2016 lawsuit. In court filings obtained by Deadspin at the time, White’s former bandmate, Lena Zawaideh, accused him of having “repeatedly sexually harassed her and forced his authoritarian management style on her for over seven years.” The suit was reportedly settled privately last year.</p>
<p>“I’m here to talk about the Olympics, not, you know, gossip,” White told reporters on Wednesday of the accusations.</p>
<p>Asked whether he thought the controversy would tarnish his legacy, the 31-year-old said: “I don’t think so. I am who I am and proud of who I am. And my friends love me and vouch for me and I think that stands on its own.” </p>
<p>Later on Wednesday, White apologized for using the word “gossip,” telling NBC’s “Today” show that “it was a poor choice of words to describe such a sensitive subject in the world today.”</p>
<p>U.S. Snowboarding and Freeskiing event director Nick Alexakos eventually cut off the journalists, telling them the interview should focus on the competition.</p>
<p>White had previously admitted to sending sexually explicit texts to Zawaideh, but denied her other allegations.</p>
<p>“Many years ago, I exchanged texts with a friend who is now using them to craft a bogus lawsuit,” he told TMZ in 2016.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, White “sent sexually explicit and graphic images to Zawaideh of engorged and erect penises, forced her to watch sexually disturbing videos, including videos sexualizing human fecal matter, and made vulgar sexual remarks to her such as, ‘Don’t forget to suck his balls!’ when commenting on her boyfriend.”</p>
<p>She also accused him of grabbing her behind, making an unwanted move to kiss her and touching his penis inside his pants, then trying to make her smell his hands afterward. The suit grew from her original claim that he withheld payment when he fired her.</p>

<p>SEOUL - South Korea approved on Wednesday the use of a record 2.86 billion won ($2.64 million) to bankroll the cost of hosting hundreds of visiting North Koreans during the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.</p>
<p> The Ministry of Unification said the funds will pay for the costs including accommodations and food for North Korea’s cheering squad, orchestra, taekwondo performers, journalists and other supporting personnel who had visited or are still in South Korea. Combined, they make a group of 424 North Koreans. South Korean President Moon Jae-in invited North Korea athletes, supporters and officials to the Olympics in an attempt to lower months of tension between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. A final number for the total payment of all the North Koreans who visited during the Olympics will be disclosed at a later time, said ministry spokesman Baik Tae-hyun in a briefing. Costs for hosting the high-level official delegation which included Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, were paid for separately from the government budget, Baik added without disclosing details. The International Olympics Committee will foot the bill for 22 North Korean athletes also in South Korea. Travel between the two Koreas has been impossible without the approval of both governments since the 1950-53 war that divided the peninsula and ended in a truce rather than a peace treaty. Wednesday’s number far exceeds the 1.35 billion won that was used to pay for the 650 North Koreans who visited South Korea in 2002 for the Asian Games in the port city of Busan. The smaller amount in 2002 was partly due to the North Koreans’ cheering squad staying and eating on the ferry they had arrived in, a ministry official told Reuters who spoke on condition of anonymity. Inflation also attributed to the higher number. From the biggest portion of the 2.86 billion won, about 1.2 billion won will be used for accommodations and food, the official added. Roughly 1.0 billion won will be used to pay for entrance fees for Olympics venues and 100 million won has been set aside for transportation costs. Most of the North Koreans stayed at luxury hotels in Seoul and near the Olympics venue nearly throughout their visit, including the five-star Grand Walkerhill in western Seoul that has previously hosted celebrities including Paris Hilton and Michael Jackson. The budget for the North Koreans’ stay will be withdrawn from the Inter-Korean Cooperation Fund, part of the Unification Ministry’s spending budget. The fund was created in 1991 for North Korea-related expenditures and its total 2018 budget is 962.4 billion won. </p>

<p>Chloe Kim has emerged as the best story from the PyeongChang Olympics thus far. Everyone wants to talk about her victory, share her family’s story and hire her as a spokesperson for pretty much any food item.</p>
<p>Despite the abundance of topics, one Barstool Sports radio personality opted to go a different route and make a disrespectful comment about an underage and female athlete..</p>
<p>He decided it would be a good idea to call 17-year-old Chloe Kim a “little hot piece of ass.”</p>
<p>That exchange took place on “Dialed-In with Dallas Braden,” a radio show on Barstool Radio’s SiriusXM channel. Braden is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who has worked for ESPN. He did not make the comment in question, that was done by co-host Patrick Connor.</p>
<p>Audio of the event was captured by Deadspin. During the conversation, Connor makes reference to Kim’s 18th birthday coming up in April. He compares himself to Matthew McConaughey’s character in “Dazed and Confused,” who is famous for the line “That’s what I love about these high school girls. I get older, they stay the same age.” Connor even quotes that line.</p>
<p>After Brody Stevens, another co-host, agrees, Connor says the following: “She’s fine as hell. If she was 18, you wouldn’t be ashamed to say that she’s a little hot piece of ass. And she is. She is adorable. I’m a huge Chloe Kim fan.”</p>
<p>Aside from his work with Barstool Sports, Connor hosts a show on KNBR in San Francisco.</p>
<p>So far, this appears to be his lone response to his controversial comment.</p>

<p>Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir deserve top marks for their pre-show ritual at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>Before each live broadcast on NBC, the Olympic figure skaters-turned-commentators bust out an amusing handshake ― which ends with what appears to be a slam-dunk.</p>
<p>Check it out here:</p>
<p>Weir described their pre-commentary ritual as a “goody” in an interview with The Washington Post, which shared footage of the move online Tuesday.</p>
<p> “From touring, you have these little handshakes and things that you do with your co-stars in the shows, whether it’s a handshake, or a booty bump, or whatever it may be. Terry, Tara and I all have one that we do, the three of us, and we can’t do a show without doing it.” Johnny Weir </p>
<p>Sportscaster Terry Gannon features in the ritual, but the limelight belongs to his two co-presenters.</p>
<p>Will it become an iconic Olympic pose? Here’s hoping ...</p>

<p>A dead ringer for North Korea dictator Kim Jong Un caused mischief during a historic ice hockey game at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Wednesday.</p>
<p>As the unified Korean women’s team took to the ice for its game against Japan, a man who identified himself only as Howard walked in front of the North Korean cheer squad and waved at the crowd.</p>
<p>He also waved what appeared to be a flag depicting a unified Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>South Korean counter-terrorism officials escorted him away to a nearby seat, reports Reuters.</p>
<p>Vincent Bevins, a correspondent who writes for The Washington Post, shared footage of the incident to Twitter.</p>
<p>According to Bevins, who was on the scene, local police then took Howard to a nearby hallway where he protested his innocence.</p>
<p>“I just want to see the game, so what’s the problem?” he’s heard asking in another video that Bevins shared below.</p>
<p>Officials then took Howard into a nearby office for questioning.</p>
<p>He was released a short period later and was reportedly “politely asked” to leave the ice hockey stadium:</p>
<p>“My face is too political,” Howard told Reuters in an apparent, and likely mischievous, effort to play down his resemblance to the North Korean despot. “I was born with this face, I’ve got to live with it.” </p>
<p>The International Olympic Committee Charter prohibits “the Games from being used as a platform for protests, demonstrations or the promotion of political, religious or racial propaganda.”</p>
<p>Howard missed the conclusion of the hockey game, which ended in a 4-1 victory for Japan. He’s believed to be the same Kim Jong Un lookalike who showed up to Friday’s opening ceremony alongside a doppelgänger of U.S. President Donald Trump. Security staff also ended up escorting them out.</p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Japanese short track speed skater Kei Saito has failed an out-of-competition doping test and was expelled from the Pyeongchang Olympic Games, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Saito, a reserve athlete who had not yet competed, was provisionally suspended after testing positive for masking agent acetalozamide, CAS said, adding that a final ruling would be issued after the Games.</p>
<p>Masking agents are often used to cover up banned performance-enhancing substances.</p>
<p>This is the first doping case during the testing period of the Olympics in South Korea and comes as Tokyo prepares to host the Summer Games in 2020.</p>
<p>“The athlete accepted on a voluntary basis to be provisionally suspended and to leave the Olympic village,” CAS said.</p>
<p>“As a consequence, the athlete is provisionally suspended from competing at the Pyeongchang 2018 (Olympic Games) and at any future ISU (International Skating Union) competition pending the resolution of this matter.”</p>
<p>The Japanese Olympic Committee is to hold a news conference later in the day.</p>
<p>Doping cases are rare among Japanese athletes and this is the first for the country at a Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>Last month, however, sprint canoeist Yasuhiro Suzuki admitted to spiking a rival’s drink with an anabolic steroid to scuttle his Olympic dream, and was banned for eight years.</p>
<p>He now faces a lifetime ban from the Japan canoe federation.</p>

<p>Another Winter Olympics, another tussle over the masks of U.S. ice hockey goaltenders.</p>
<p>USA Today reported Tuesday that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had ordered two goalies on the U.S. women’s ice hockey team to remove images of the Statue of Liberty from their masks to conform to IOC rules.</p>
<p>Goalie Nicole Hensley has an image of Lady Liberty on the left side of her mask, while goalie Alex Rigsby has the symbol on her chin. According to IOC rules, athletes cannot wear items that feature the “wording or lyrics from national anthems, motivational words, public/political messaging or slogans related to national identity.”</p>
<p>USA Hockey spokesman Dave Fischer told USA Today that the team was in “discussions” with the IOC to see if the goalies could keep the images on their masks.</p>
<p>He added that the issue should be resolved before the USA’s next game, slated to take place on Tuesday night local time against the Olympic Athletes from Russia.</p>
<p>The IOC said in a tweet early Tuesday that “there seems to have been a misunderstanding,” and that it “had not asked for the symbol to be removed.”</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that U.S. goalie masks have been given the thumbs-down by the IOC. Before the Sochi Winter Games in 2014, goalie Jessie Vetter had to remove an image of the Preamble to the Constitution from her mask because of the same IOC rules.</p>
<p>In 2010, goalie Ryan Miller had to nix the phrase “Miller Time” from his mask, while Jonathan Quick had to remove the words “Support our troops.”</p>
<p>This article has been updated to include the IOC statement.</p>

<p>Former Major League Baseball player Esteban Loaiza has been charged with drug trafficking after police said they found 44 pounds of suspected cocaine at a home he rented near the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>
<p>The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department valued the drugs at $500,000. Loaiza, 46, was charged with drug possession and trafficking and was jailed under $200,000 bail.</p>
<p>Police said Loaiza, a former All-Star pitcher who had a 14-year MLB career, was stopped for a traffic infraction on Friday. He had already been on law enforcement’s radar because he’d been seen driving a vehicle “believed to be involved in the smuggling of narcotics,” the sheriff’s department said.</p>
<p>Deputies searching Loaiza’s car found a “sophisticated” compartment for concealing contraband and obtained a search warrant for the home in Imperial Beach, California, that Loaiza had been renting since early February.</p>
<p>Investigators say they discovered packages of “white powder” weighing 20 kilograms, or about 44 pounds. The sheriff’s department described the substance as suspected cocaine, though it’s still being tested and could include other drugs.</p>
<p>Loaiza’s agent, John Boggs, told the San Francisco Chronicle that he had not been in contact with his client recently and was “shocked” by the arrest. </p>
<p>“I am shocked and saddened by the news and had no indication he would ever be in this type of situation,” Boggs said. “I don’t know how he would get himself involved in this, so it’s difficult to even comment on it.”</p>
<p>Loaiza was born in Tijuana, Mexico, just across the border from Imperial Beach. From 1995 until his retirement in 2008, he played for teams that included the Pittsburgh Pirates, New York Yankees and Chicago White Sox.</p>
<p>He was the starting pitcher in the 2003 All-Star Game and, according to the New York Daily News, was the second-winningest pitcher from Mexico in MLB history.</p>
<p>As CBS Sports noted, Loaiza made an appearance earlier this month at a White Sox fan event in Chicago.</p>

<p>Much was made of Team USA figure skater Mirai Nagasu’s nailing of a triple axel jump at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, on Monday.</p>
<p>And rightly so.</p>

<p>After a poor showing at Sochi 2014 and a scary practice fall that left him with 62 stitches on his face last October, snowboarder Shaun White took a spectacular step in his comeback at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the two-time gold medalist posted a 98.50 on his second run to lead the qualifying into the men’s final of the halfpipe. That’s near-perfection.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old reacted, as expected, to the score.</p>
<p>“I’m excited,” he said.</p>
<p>“I started seeing everyone putting these great runs in and I figured I would step it up,” White told NBC Sports. “They motivated me to send it on that last one.”</p>

<p>Figure skater Adam Rippon harbored dreams of Olympic glory long before his dazzling games debut this week in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>In a recently unearthed 2003 interview with Pennsylvania TV station WNEP-TV, Rippon, then 13, demonstrated much the same determination as he did Monday when he helped Team USA clinch a bronze medal in the figure skating team event.</p>
<p>Rippon, now 28, had been skating for just over three years when he appeared on the channel’s Newswatch 16 program. He spoke enthusiastically about competing in Europe, taking his first airplane and train rides, and visiting the Olympic museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>
<p>“And then, when you see, like, all these things about other people who have won the Olympics and everything, you think that you’ve done a great thing,” Rippon, a Scranton, Pennsylvania, native, told reporter Jim Coles. “But you’re still so far away.”</p>
<p>The young Rippon, who has since become the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete at the games, also had some tips on how to succeed in the sport:</p>
<p> “All the little things that your coach tells you, you always have to remember them. And you always have to try not to overdo it, just to do it. So as long as you remember everything your coach tells you, you’ll be OK.” </p>
<p>Rippon has risen to prominence during his time in South Korea for hitting out at Vice President Mike Pence’s alleged intolerance toward the LGBTQ community, the condoms in the Olympic village, and for joking about wanting “Xanax and a quick drink” on the ice. He has a further shot at gold in the men’s single skating event Friday.</p>

<p>Seventeen-year-old Chloe Kim won gold at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics with a near-flawless score of 98.25 in the women’s snowboard halfpipe event ― and she did it even though she was hangry.</p>
<p>Kim, the youngest-ever gold medalist in the halfpipe event, topped the field, while U.S. teammate Arielle Gold took the bronze. But even at the top of the slope, Kim didn’t appear to be too nervous, firing off a breakfast-related tweet between her second and third runs:</p>
<p>Kim said she was hangry ― hungry and angry ― while waiting for her third run, where she nailed the 98.25, beating the impressive score she’d already recorded on her first run. Soon after, fans started wanting to help her out with a bite to eat. </p>
<p>Kim has delighted fans by talking up her favorite junk foods, even during competition.</p>
<p>When a fan asked Kim if she’d sent her ice cream tweet while competing in the preliminary rounds of the halfpipe, Kim replied, “yes....” </p>
<p>You’ll be happy to know, though, that she finally did get that ice cream she’d been hankering for.</p>

<p>American snowboarding prodigy Chloe Kim has taken the gold medal in the women’s snowboard halfpipe at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, topping the field with a phenomenal 98.25 score in the final, while fellow American Arielle Gold took the bronze.</p>
<p>Kim, the 17-year-old Californian, served up the near-perfect score on her last of three runs in the daytime final on Tuesday, a mark that none of the 11 other competitors could match. She is the youngest ever gold medalist in the halfpipe event.</p>
<p>It was the third gold of the Games for the United States, following fellow 17-year-old Red Gerard’s win in the men’s snowboarding slopestyle competition, and Jamie Anderson taking gold in the same event for women.</p>
<p>Even though Kim’s winning score came in her final run, she had secured the gold with her first score of 93. Her second run failed to impress, getting a 41 from judges, but her flawless third effort clinched her top position in what is her first Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>Kim, a four-time X Games gold medalist, was joined by fellow U.S. snowboarders Kelly Clark and Maddie Mastro in the final, who placed fourth and 12th, respectively.</p>
<p>Gold, who had missed the 2014 Sochi Games due to injury, took bronze with a top score of 85.85.</p>
<p>Kim’s elation following her 93.75 run was obvious.</p>
<p>But if she was nervous while waiting between her runs, she didn’t show it. Just minutes before her third and final run, Kim’s mind was not on the halfpipe but on her stomach.</p>
<p>She had delighted fans in previous days by talking up her favorite junk food.</p>
<p>When a fan asked if she sent her ice cream tweet while competing in the preliminary rounds, she replied “yes....” </p>

<p>Maame Biney’s quest for Winter Olympics glory is still alive ― but it took a hit on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In her first-round debut on Saturday, Biney staved off a charge from an opponent to finish second and advance. This time she “got bumped and boxed out,” Yahoo reported, and she couldn’t make up the deficit.</p>

Sports">
<p>Adam Rippon and Mirai Nagasu share a special bond. It’s about more than just being Olympians. It’s about more than their first Olympic medals, won this past weekend in the team event in PyeongChang. It’s deeper than that. And the emblems of it are matching tattoos.</p>
<p>In fact, it, and the tattoos, stem from missing out on the Olympics. Four years ago, both Rippon and Nagasu were left off the U.S. figure skating team for the 2014 Sochi Games. Nagasu was overlooked despite a third-place finish at the U.S. Championships.</p>
<p>Rippon remembers watching the Sochi Opening Ceremony a month later at Nagasu’s house, and commiserating over In-N-Out burgers. He told Yahoo Sports that story, as well as the one behind the tattoos, on Tuesday ahead of his individual event later this week.</p>
<p>“We sat on the roof,” he recalls. “And we were just kind of talking, we weren’t even watching the Olympics. We were just kind of crying a little bit, and eating [In-N-Out] double-doubles and animal-style fries.</p>
<p>“We were sitting up there, and we were laying back, we looked up at the sky and the stars, and we had a long talk. I remember telling her, ‘I’m so grateful you’re my friend.’”</p>
<p>Rippon says the moment is “still so poignant in my mind.” He says he told Nagasu, “We’ll be able to get through this.”</p>
<p>At some point, Rippon also proposed the idea of the tattoos.</p>
<p>“After everything that we went through four years ago, I said, ‘I want to have a matching tattoo with you,’” he recalls. “You pick what it is, and I’ll get whatever you want.”</p>
<p>Rippon says they joked about getting the Abercrombie moose. But eventually, Nagasu found a glyph – a circle with lines through it – that means “power.”</p>
<p>Rippon got his on his left thigh, just above his kneecap. Nagasu has hers near her wrist. Both are in white ink, as are the rest of Rippon’s tattoos – he says he has “seven or nine.”</p>
<p>“You can hide them pretty well,” Rippon says. “Not everybody can see them.”</p>
<p>But the two Olympic figure skaters, who are rooming together in PyeongChang, know they’re there, and that’s what matters. “It’s something really personal between me and her,” Rippon says. The tattoos strengthen the bond that was built throughout years of skating – and on Nagasu’s roof.</p>
<p>“There’s been a lot of ups and downs since then,” Rippon says. “To be here now, especially with her of all people, is crazy.</p>
<p>“So if you’re ever depressed,” Rippon concludes with a smile, “go to In-N-Out, and four years later, you can be at the Olympics.”</p>

<p>The father of U.S. snowboarding sensation Chloe Kim had a message for reporters after her spectacular Olympic gold medal win on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pointing to himself, Kim Jong-jin said “American dream” before letting out a cheer, according to The Associated Press. A day earlier, the elder Kim told the “Today” show that his daughter was his American dream. It was a sentiment that had moved many fans to tears.</p>
<p>The younger Kim, who dominated women’s snowboard halfpipe event on Tuesday, told reporters after her victory that she “did it for my family.”</p>
<p>“My dad has definitely sacrificed a lot for me and I don’t know if I could do it, if I was in his shoes,” the 17-year-old said, according to Reuters. “Leaving your life behind and chasing this dream because your kid is passionate about this sport. I think today I did it for my family and I am so grateful to them.”</p>
<p>Kim’s dad, who emigrated from South Korea to California in 1982, quit his engineering job about a decade ago to support his daughter’s budding snowboarding career. Since then, he’s devoted himself to helping her succeed ― though he’s downplayed his sacrifices as “normal for all parents.”</p>
<p>When Kim was in middle school, her dad would drive her six hours to Mammoth Mountain every weekend so she could train there. </p>
<p>“What would happen is that he would carry me out of bed,” Kim recalled in a 2016 interview. “I would wake up in a new spot every time without even knowing what happened.” </p>
<p>When they got to the mountain, Kim’s dad would strap on his own board and ride by her side. “He never knew much about snowboarding, but he did everything he could,” Tommy Czeschin, a former U.S. Snowboarding coach, told Bleacher Report last month. </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Kim’s parents and extended family, including her 75-year-old grandmother, were there to watch the teen clinch the gold medal at Phoenix Snow Park in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>“To see Chloe compete in the Olympics, it’s going to be very exciting and happy,” her mom, Boran Kim, told The New York Times in the days leading up to the event. “I think it will be the best moment of my whole life.”</p>
<p>Kim’s dad won hearts with a handmade ― and laminated ― sign that he held up during his daughter’s runs. According to NBC, the poster was given to him by young snowboarders from California’s Mountain High resort, where his daughter used to ride and compete. </p>
<p>The elder Kim told NBC that, before Tuesday’s event, he texted his daughter, “Today is the day imugi turns to dragon,” a reference to a Korean legend.</p>
<p>“She was born in year of dragon,” he said. “To be a dragon in Korean tradition is to wait 1,000 years. Before [you are] a simple snake, like an anaconda. But they wait about 1,000 years, and then they turn to dragon. Go to the sky, and they make a big dragon with a gold pearl. She’s got a gold pearl in her mouth. I texted her this morning that this is the time to be dragon.”</p>
<p>“It turned out pretty well,” the younger Kim later told NBC. “If I’m a dragon, I’m down.”</p>
<p>Kim told reporters that her win in Pyeongchang was special for her family, who have done so much “to help me accomplish this dream of mine.”</p>
<p>“So being able to do it here, in their home country, is amazing,” she said.</p>

<p>American luger Emily Sweeney crashed during the women’s singles competition at the Winter Olympics on Tuesday, and was reportedly taken to a hospital for evaluation.</p>
<p>Sweeney, 24, was speeding around a curve when she lost control, bounced off the walls and flew off her sled.</p>
<p>She was conscious and was able to walk off the ice with some assistance. She was later seen being escorted to an ambulance and taken to a hospital for evaluation, according to online reports.</p>

<p>Pita Taufatofua, the Tongan flag bearer known for his shirtless marches in this year’s Winter Olympics’ opening ceremony and in the 2016 Summer Games, is competing in Pyeongchang, South Korea, with much more on his mind than sport.</p>
<p>Taufatofua said on Facebook Tuesday that he had yet to hear from family and friends after a tropical cyclone tore through his homeland.</p>
<p>“Things like this really put life and what’s important in life into perspective,” he wrote. “I wish I could be there right now to help.”</p>

<p>At a press briefing last week with International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams, there was stern talk about a country of cheaters so shot through with a gold-at-all-costs mentality that they countenanced the systematic exploitation of Olympic athletes.</p>
<p>And when they weren’t talking about the United States, they talked some about Russia.</p>
<p>“I join everyone by saying how appalling this is and how appalled as a parent you can be when you read these things,” Adams said to reporters, referring to the Larry Nassar sexual abuse case that has consumed USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee. Moments earlier, he had addressed a mild softening of the IOC’s ban on Russian athletes from the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, vamping about “democracy and liberty and freedom.”</p>
<p>It was a revealing moment, a pair of Olympic scandals meeting on the eve of the Winter Games, which began in earnest Friday. In Adams’ fluent institutionalese — his “guidelines” and “briefings” and “processes” and “agenda” — the grotesque particulars of the two cases fell away, and you could begin to see the essential similarities.</p>
<p>These were both scandals of entrenched abuse, born in one instance and deepened in the other out of a desire to win. Because of a wish for Olympic superiority, Russia’s Olympic Committee systematically drugged its athletes. Because of a wish for Olympic superiority, the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics failed to protect their athletes from the interweaving of emotional and sexual abuse.</p>
<p>So why not ban the United States? By what moral logic are the Russians any more deserving of punishment than Americans?</p>
<p>Part of the U.S.’s evasion of culpability here derives from how the country has structured its institutions. Americans have a well-established doping regime, too; it’s just privatized and corporatized, like America itself. By law, the USOC, which is said to have covered up more than 100 positive tests from 1988 to 2000, receives no public funding, and the job of exotic chemical experimentation on the athletes tends to fall to outfits like the Nike Oregon Project. The USOC itself operates according to a statutory federalism by which governing bodies oversee their own sports.</p>
<p>One result of such an arrangement is that the United States gets to distribute its guilt among its subsidiaries. No doping program could ever be “state-sponsored” here for the simple reason that the state doesn’t sponsor much of anything. Plausible deniability is America’s strongest Olympic event.</p>
<p>The Nassar cover-up, involving crimes vastly more heinous than doping, pierces our national impunity. It’s an even bigger affront to the preposterous ideal of “clean” and “pure” sport: a two-decade scheme, implicating Olympic officials and public officials alike, that allowed Nassar to continually sexually abuse and assault more than 250 female athletes ― including multiple gold medal-winning American gymnasts ― in his capacity as a team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. A phrase comes to mind: state-sponsored.</p>
<p>Nassar, in fact, was so ingrained in America’s Olympic program and so relentless in preying on young athletes that he abused gymnast Aly Raisman during the 2012 Olympic Games in London. The USOC, meanwhile, turned a blind eye to Nassar’s abuse and ignored his victims, Raisman said in the victim statement she read in the courtroom during Nassar’s sentencing hearing in January.</p>
<p>“They say now they applaud those who have spoken out, but it’s easier to say that now,” Raisman said. “When the brave women who started speaking out back then, more than a year after the USOC says they knew about Nassar, they were dismissed. At the 2016 Olympic Games, the president of the USOC said that the USOC would not conduct an investigation and even defended USA Gymnastics as one of the leaders in developing policies to protect athletes. That’s the response a courageous woman gets when she speaks out? And when others joined those athletes and began speaking out with more stories of abuse, were they acknowledged? No. It is like being abused all over again.”</p>
<p>“I have represented the United States of America in two Olympics and have done so successfully, and both USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee have been very quick to capitalize and celebrate my success,” she continued. “But did they reach out when I came forward? No. So, at this point, talk is worthless to me. We’re dealing with real lives in the future of our sport. We need to believe this won’t happen again.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just that the USOC and USA Gymnastics didn’t listen. Certain members of the two organizations seem to have actively protected Nassar, while the policies the groups adopted continued to provide him the power and the platform to molest and abuse his victims.</p>
<p>Gymnasts for the national team were trained in the emotionally abusive environment of Karolyi Ranch in Texas, against which Nassar could pose as a kindly, sympathetic figure.</p>
<p>“I always felt like I got in trouble,” 2000 Olympian Jamie Dantzscher told “60 Minutes” a year ago. “I wasn’t working hard enough. I was told to lose weight. At one point, I started making myself throw up.” Nassar, she said, “was like my buddy. He was on my side.” Getting medical treatment from him “was kind of like a bright light,” she said, even though it was under the guise of treatment that Nassar was also sexually abusing her.</p>
<p>The USOC and USA Gymnastics required that gymnasts go through Nassar’s treatments. If they refused, they jeopardized their place on the team. USA Gymnastics officials and coaches, like Nassar’s close friend and top gymnastics coach John Geddert, continued to leave Nassar alone with girls and young women (Geddert is now the subject of a criminal investigation). And the USOC and USA Gymnastics continued to do nothing, even after women began coming forward years ago.</p>
<p>After Nassar’s sentencing in January, the USOC sent a letter of apology to Nassar’s victims. But until then it had taken almost no responsibility for its role in the scandal, and even its apology contained hardly any internal reckoning over the fact that the most successful period in U.S. women’s gymnastics history ― a team gold in 1996 and two more in 2012 and 2016 ― occurred under the specter of sexual abuse with which the USOC and USA Gymnastics were complicit.</p>
<p>“I hold the USOC directly accountable,” Nancy Hogshead-Makar, a former Olympic swimmer who has spent years advocating for policy changes to protect female athletes, told HuffPost. “I’ve been working with the USOC for eight years, and trying to alert them to this problem. Their legal defense, if you follow the court cases, is, ‘It’s not our problem.’”</p>
<p>And even now, top USOC officials have refused to admit any culpability in Nassar’s crimes. CEO Scott Blackmun will keep his job, at least until the conclusion of an independent investigation, USOC Chairman Larry Probst said at a news conference in Pyeongchang on Friday, even though it’s unclear how independent that investigation really is.</p>
<p>“We are far from unscathed,” Probst said. “There’s been a tremendous amount of criticism about the USOC. We think that we did what we were supposed to do. Could we have done more? Of course, we could always do more.”</p>
<p>The entire board of directors for USA Gymnastics resigned in January. But before that, the organization asked a federal judge to dismiss a civil suit against it and said that information from Nassar’s accusers “did not provide reasonable suspicion that sexual abuse had occurred,” that it “never attempted to hide Nassar’s misconduct” and that, “while Nassar is liable to the plaintiffs, USAG is not.” </p>
<p>So far, beyond the courts, the only meaningful reckoning with the Nassar scandal is happening in Congress, of all places. The House passed a law in the wake of Nassar’s sentencing that will increase mandatory reporting requirements for officials at athletic federations, such as USA Gymnastics and the USOC. More congressional scrutiny could soon follow, especially given fresh awareness that similar problems exist in USA Swimming and across the U.S. Olympic program, too. </p>
<p>But Americans, brought up on the old impunity, loyal to their own flag, seem loath to see Nassar as evidence of the sort of far-reaching institutional rot they’re quick to ascribe to more centralized Olympic programs, such as Russia’s. Commenters almost universally cheered the banning of an entire federation over doping; not a soul has called for the banning of the United States over state-sponsored sexual assault. This gets things exactly backward.</p>
<p>Doping, like all crises surrounding drug use, is a moral panic. There’s little credible evidence that a ban like the one the IOC handed Russia will do anything to address the sort of illicit chemical enhancements that have always been the Olympics’ worst-kept secret. Prohibitionism hasn’t worked so far. Hard-line prohibitionism won’t work any better.</p>
<p>State-sponsored sexual assault, on the other hand, is a moral calamity — a failing that calls into question not just the integrity of the competition and of the organizations that engage in it, but their very existence. Nassar’s crimes were real crimes; our Olympics institutions enabled them and exacerbated them, and the rot spread beyond sports into the public realm. </p>
<p>A ban would make it clear, to Americans and to the world, that the people who run the USOC are complicit in the evil that happens on their watch, even if the structure of our Olympic project is explicitly designed to ensure their hands are always clean.</p>
<p>“Right now, you’re just an organization who allowed predators and abuse to happen,” 1996 gold medal-winning gymnast Dominique Moceanu said at a January news conference in Washington. She was talking about USA Gymnastics, but she might as well have been talking about the whole of the U.S. Olympics system. “You have to redefine, what are we moving forward? Let’s... have a fresh start, almost as if it’s a new organization.”</p>
<p>Some time away from Olympic competition might just help. Ban us.</p>

<p>Team USA’s Mirai Nagasu has made history at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games, becoming the first U.S. female figure skater — and third woman ever — to nail a triple axel during an Olympic competition.</p>
<p>Nagasu, 24, was competing in the women’s free skate in the team event on Monday when she landed the difficult jump. Nagasu received a score of 137.53 for the routine — a personal best. </p>
<p>Viewers, naturally, went wild.</p>
<p>Even Kristi Yamaguchi, the former Team USA figure skater and Olympic champion, said she was shedding “tears of joy” over Nagasu’s achievement.</p>
<p>Nagasu, who also landed a triple axel at the U.S. International Figure Skating Classic last year, is among just a handful of women who have successfully executed the jump in competition. Tonya Harding was the first American woman to achieve the feat, nailing the move at the national championship in 1991.</p>
<p>The Players’ Tribune shared a video on Twitter showing how athletes like Nagasu train to land the challenging jump. It includes using an off-ice skating harness, which can help athletes get a feel of a jump’s rotations.</p>

<p>An athlete from doping-tainted Russia is behind one of the more heartwarming sportsmanship stories to emerge at the Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>Chris Mazdzer, who won the first singles luge medal in U.S. men’s history by taking silver over the weekend, said a Russian luger offered to lend him his sled in January when Mazdzer was mired in a slump.</p>
<p>“I guess this goes against every U.S.-Russian stereotype ever,” Mazdzer said, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>Mazdzer noted that the luge was state-of-the-art. He said the unnamed competitor didn’t think he was going to the Olympics. But the athlete wanted to see how his sled would fare.</p>
<p>Mazdzer took it for a practice run at an event in Latvia but decided he was too big for it.</p>
<p>“I think what it shows is that we do care about each other and there is this human connection we have that crosses countries, crosses cultures,” Mazdzer told reporters, according to USA Today. “And sport is an amazing way to accomplish that.”</p>
<p>Mazdzer found his groove without the sled, making Team USA history after two 13th place finishes in previous Olympics. But he remembered the gesture.</p>
<p>“That friendship and trust was really moving,” he said</p>
<p>Russia was officially banned from the games for systemic doping. Some of its athletes were later allowed in on the unaffiliated OAR team, Olympic Athletes from Russia, if they could prove they were clean.</p>
<p>Mazdzer said the Russian who made the generous offer competed at the games in Pyeonchang, South Korea, according to The Washington Post. But he declined to reveal the competitor’s name.</p>

<p>With the landing of a historic triple axel at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Mirai Nagasu instantly became a role model to many younger American skaters.</p>
<p>But the 24-year-old draws her own inspiration from Asian-American skating legend Michelle Kwan, who won Olympic silver and bronze.</p>
<p>In an interview with NBC News, Nagasu, whose parents run a sushi restaurant in Arcadia, California, said that she’s long admired Kwan and noted their similar backgrounds.</p>
<p>“Her parents owned a restaurant and my parents own a restaurant. We’re both from California. So I really looked up to her,” Nagasu told NBC News. “As role models, I think Kristi [Yamaguchi] and Michelle are setting the bar really high.”</p>
<p>For both Nagasu and Kwan, their Asian immigrant backgrounds come with stories of sacrifice.</p>
<p>Nagasu’s parents, Kiyoto and Ikuko, came to the U.S. from Japan about three decades ago to open their own sushi restaurant, according to the Los Angeles Times. The couple currently run Kiyosuzu, which on special occasions offers the “Mirai Roll” ― according to USA Today, it’s a combination of tuna, tuna tataki, avocado, mentaiko (pollock roe), shrimp and tempura. They were unable to watch their daughter’s historic performance in the team competition live due to the dinner rush Sunday night, USA Today reported.</p>
<p>But next week, the couple will close the restaurant and head over to South Korea to watch their daughter compete in the individual figure skating contest. </p>
<p>“The business is important, but it is special to be able to watch Mirai,” Ikuko told USA Today. “We will shut the restaurant, go quickly, and come back quickly.”</p>
<p>Like Nagasu’s family, Kwan’s is no stranger to long hours. She told The Cut that her parents worked hard to achieve the American Dream. Kwan’s father, Danny, bought a Chinese restaurant after saving up enough money working as a bus boy and then a telephone company employee, according to the Chicago Tribune.</p>
<p>“My parents didn’t have the means to provide brand-new skates, flashy costumes, or ice time. They were barely juggling multiple jobs, providing a roof over our heads, feeding us, working at the restaurant, my dad was working at a phone company, and then they gave me this crazy opportunity to ice skate!” Kwan told The Cut. “Maybe I didn’t get new skates, but I got used skates. I made it to the national championships in used skates that were custom-made for another girl.”</p>
<p>Her parents still found the time to dish out important advice, like urging their talented daughter to appreciate her accomplishments along the way. </p>
<p>“You keep working to get better, but if you learn to be satisfied, it puts you at ease and you avoid the highs and lows,” Kwan’s father told The New York Times back in 1998.</p>

<p>The athletes did not fly through the air with the greatest of ease during the wind-whipped women’s slopestyle at the Winter Olympics on Monday. But reigning Olympic champion Jamie Anderson tamed the conditions enough to win the gold medal in Pyeongchang, South Korea ― defending the gold she won four years ago in the same event.</p>
<p>She became the first female snowboarder to win multiple golds and notched the second gold for the United States at this year’s games.</p>
<p>“I’m feeling so happy,” Anderson said, per the Olympics’ news service. “I’ve gone through so much this last year just preparing for the Games and defending the gold is definitely not an easy position to be in.”</p>
<p>Much of the drama was created by the wind, which wiped out Sunday’s qualifying. So the whole field got to compete in Monday’s final in two runs for the gold. </p>
<p>But the conditions remained dangerous. After a 75-minute delay, Anderson and the rest of the field went to work. Much of the field struggled mightily against the elements, but Anderson managed to record an 83 on her first run to take the lead, and that score held up.</p>
<p>Canada’s Laurie Blouin and Finland’s Enni Rukarvi took silver and bronze, respectively.</p>
<p>Anderson’s victory left the U.S. perfect in slopestyle since its introduction at Sochi in 2014. Red Gerard won for the men’s side a day earlier in South Korea, and Anderson and Sage Kotsenburg won the slopestyle golds in 2014.</p>

<p>Olympics officials confirmed on Sunday that a cyberattack during the opening ceremony last week disrupted Wi-Fi and television at Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium and knocked servers offline for about 12 hours.</p>
<p>International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams told Reuters the attack didn’t affect any critical operations, though South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency notes it did prevent some would-be spectators from printing tickets to the games.</p>
<p>Adams declined to comment further on the source of the attack, a decision reached in tandem with the Pyeongchang organizing committee.</p>
<p>“We decided with the IOC we are not going to reveal the source (of the attack),” committee spokesman Sung Baik-you told Reuters. “All issues were resolved and recovered yesterday morning.”</p>
<p>A report on the attack by Cisco’s Talos Intelligence Group concluded the hackers likely compromised the network well ahead of the games, meaning the timing of the attack ― during the opening ceremony ― was intentional and intended to embarrass Olympics organizers.</p>
<p>Also telling: The hackers didn’t attempt to steal information once they’d gained access. Instead, they tried to destroy the system and leave it inoperable.</p>
<p>“Disruption is the clear objective in this type of attack,” the Talos researchers concluded, “and it leaves us confident in thinking that the actors behind this were after embarrassment of the Olympic committee during the opening ceremony.”</p>
<p>Other experts reached similar conclusions. </p>
<p>“It says something sad and frightening that the question of a cyber attack on the Winter Olympics was a matter of when, not if,” Mike Baukes, co-CEO of the cybersecurity firm UpGuard, noted in an email to HuffPost.</p>
<p>“In this instance, the attacker had gained a high degree of familiarity with the Olympic IT infrastructure, extracting technical details such as usernames, domain and server information, and even passwords - a slew of information that would provide any malicious actor with the tools necessary to launch an attack.” </p>
<p>While IOC officials aren’t assigning blame, there’s plenty of speculation that Russia was behind the attacks.</p>
<p>The IOC banned Russia from competing in the Pyeongchang Games in response to a widespread doping program, thus providing a possible motive. (Scores of individual Russian athletes are nonetheless competing in the games under the Olympic flag.) And, as the source of increasingly brazen state-sponsored hacking efforts, Russia certainly has the means.</p>
<p>Amid speculation in the security community that Russia could hack the Winter Olympics, the country professed its innocence in advance, issuing a statement days before the games began.</p>
<p>“We know that Western media are planning pseudo-investigations on the theme of ‘Russian fingerprints’ in hacking attacks on information resources related to the hosting of the Winter Olympic Games in the Republic of Korea,” Russia’s foreign ministry said in a statement obtained by Reuters. “Of course, no evidence will be presented to the world.”</p>
<p>In 2016, the World Anti-Doping Agency said a Russian cyberespionage group had hacked, then leaked athletes’ medical files from the Summer Olympics in Rio, presumably in retaliation for the IOC’s decision to ban 119 Russian athletes from those games for doping. The Kremlin denied responsibility at the time.</p>

<p>With Adam Rippon’s dazzling debut and Mirai Nagasu’s history-making routine, Team USA clinched a bronze medal in the figure skating team event at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>Team USA amassed a total score of 62, behind the Olympic Athletes from Russia team, which won the silver medal with 66 points. Canada scored 73 points to take the gold.</p>
<p>Rippon, who competed for the U.S. in the men’s free skate on Monday and made history as the first openly gay U.S. figure skater at the Winter Games, wowed fans with his near-flawless Olympic debut. He finished third in his event, with 172.98 points.</p>
<p>In the women’s free skate, Nagasu also made history, becoming the first U.S. woman — and third overall — to nail a triple axel at the Olympics. She received a personal best score of 137.53 for the routine, ranking second in the event.</p>
<p>Brother and sister duo Maia and Alex Shibutani, known as the “Shib sibs,” also impressed with their free dance routine on Sunday, coming in second with 112.01 points. The day before, the siblings finished second in the short dance event. </p>
<p>Nathan Chen (men’s short program), Bradie Tennell (ladies’ short program) and Alexa and Chris Knierim (pairs’ short program and pairs’ free skate) also contributed to Team USA’s third-place finish.

<p>The NBC commentator who was skewered by viewers for insensitive remarks he made during the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Pyeongchang, South Korea, is no longer covering the games, the broadcaster announced on Monday.</p>
<p>“Joshua Cooper Ramo has completed his responsibilities for NBC in Pyeongchang, and will have no further role on our air,” an NBC spokesman told Reuters. The network also said Ramo had been hired only for the opening ceremonies of the games. </p>
<p>Ramo, a former journalist who served as an on-air analyst for NBC, infuriated Koreans on Friday when he flippantly commented on the history between Japan and South Korea during the opening ceremony. Spotting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Ramo mused that “every Korean will tell you that Japan is a cultural and technological and economic example, has been so important to their own transformation.”</p>
<p>Though Ramo acknowledged that Japan “occupied Korea from 1910 to 1945,” Koreans and others blasted the commentator for glossing over this brutal history, which included the sexual slavery of tens of thousands of Korean women during World War II. To this day, the former occupation continues to strain the relationship between the two nations.</p>
<p>Facing intense backlash, including displeasure from the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee and a petition signed by thousands who called Ramo’s comments “deeply hurtful and outrageous,” NBC publicly apologized on Sunday for his remark. </p>
<p>“We apologized quickly both in writing and on television for a remark made by one of our presenters during Friday night’s opening ceremony,” a spokesman said. “We’re very gratified that Pyeongchang’s organizing committee has accepted that apology.”</p>
<p>Clarification: Language in this story has been updated to include NBC’s explanation that Ramo had only been hired to cover the Olympic Games’ opening ceremonies.</p>

<p>A German shepherd who recovered from a shattered leg to become one of the favorites at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show had his comeback cut short on the first day of competition Monday.</p>
<p>The ownership team of Fanucci, a 5-year-old who lives in Farmingville, New York, pulled him out of the event because a hematoma on his left ear caused pain and made it flop, co-owner Stephanie Schrock told HuffPost.</p>
<p>“It was in the best interest of the dog to not compete,” she said. “We are very disappointed but the dog’s well-being comes first.”</p>
<p>In 2014, Fanucci jumped out of a towed van going at high speed on a highway, breaking his right rear leg in several places and nearly dying. Vets put together his limb with rods, pins and screws, and a regimen of acupuncture and therapy helped him to rehabilitate, according to Good Morning Tampa Bay in the segment above.</p>
<p>Fanucci was considered a legitimate contender to follow in the paw steps of another German shepherd, Rumor, who won best in show last year.</p>
<p>“We are truly disappointed,” Fanucci’s handler, Sue Condreras, told HuffPost.</p>

<p>U.S. figure skater Adam Rippon made his Olympic debut Monday morning to exceptional reviews from audiences watching at home, but judges in Pyeongchang, South Korea were not as impressed. </p>
<p>After skating a flawless routine lauded as one of the best of his career by commentators Tara Lipinski and Johnny Weir, judges ranked Rippon second behind Mikhail Kolyada for Olympic Athletes of Russia. After Patrick Chan of Canada performed and nabbed the top spot, Rippon was bumped down to third. </p>
<p>While both Kolyada and Chan fell during their performances, their routines had higher degrees of difficulty than Rippon’s, which led to higher scores (even with the missteps). </p>
<p>Folks on Twitter were quick to express their outrage at the judges and scoring system that Rippon was first rated second, then third, in the men’s free skate, especially considering he didn’t fall once and seemed to slay his routine.</p>
<p>According to USA Today, the scoring system used to evaluate men’s figure skating performances grants points to skaters who try new, different and challenging moves ― like the famous quadruple jump.</p>
<p>So even though skaters are penalized one point for falling, they still may earn more points overall for attempting those elements and executing parts of the move well.</p>
<p>Rippon ended the competition in third place, but his strong performance contributed to Team USA nabbing third place in the overall standing of the team event, as of this article.</p>
<p>Still, Twitter was pissed. Check out some of the responses below.</p>

<p>This probably isn’t in the Olympics handbook on how to deal with pre-competition jitters.</p>
<p>After Adam Rippon of the United States excelled during his Winter Olympics debut in the men’s free skate for the team event Monday, he and NBC Sports’ Mike Tirico talked about overcoming butterflies.</p>
<p>Tirico asked the 28-year-old Rippon what was going through his mind when he took the ice.</p>
<p>“I want to throw up,” the athlete said. “I want to go over to the judges and say, ‘Can I just have a Xanax and a quick drink. I’ll be fine.’ But I kept it together. I just took it one element at a time.”</p>
<p>Rippon finished third with 172.98 points to help Team USA to a bronze medal in the team event.</p>
<p>But he’s also getting attention off the ice for being the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete at the games ― and for his colorful comments.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Rippon took to Instagram to say he was “disappointed” that the condoms being distributed at the games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, were so bland. He griped that they could have been available in different colors or bear the Olympics logo.</p>
<p>“Life isn’t always what it seems and sometimes the condoms are just generic,” he said.</p>
<p>Rippon has also criticized Vice President Mike Pence for his perceived intolerance toward the LGBTQ community, and reportedly refused to meet the veep before the games.</p>

<p>Reese Witherspoon and Adam Rippon’s budding Twitter friendship will make your heart do a triple axel.</p>
<p>After the Olympic U.S. figure skater’s Sunday night free skate — in which he helped Team USA win bronze in the team event thanks to his stunning performance — Rippon gave NBC a little taste of what runs through his mind when he’s about to compete.</p>
<p>“There are so many emotions when I step on the ice. I want to represent my country to the best of my abilities,” Rippon said, adding cheekily, “I want to make Reese Witherspoon proud.”</p>
<p>And proud the Oscar-winning actress was. Witherspoon posted her approval of the 28-year-old Olympian’s dazzling debut on Twitter.</p>
<p>Yet, this is not the first time the two have corresponded with each other on the social media platform.</p>
<p>Their Twitteromance began when the “Big Little Lies” actress tweeted last week that Rippon was her No. 1 reason for tuning into the games.</p>
<p>And Rippon responded to her admiration in the cutest way.</p>
<p>Rippon, the first openly gay U.S. figure skater to compete at the games, is developing a reputation for his playful and often bold commentary.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Rippon posted an Instagram story in which he spoke candidly about being “disappointed” that the condoms distributed at the games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, were “just generic.”</p>
<p>“Like, I’m not entirely sure what I was expecting,” he said. “I thought maybe they’d have like Olympic rings on them or they’d be all different colors, but, no. It’s all a myth.”</p>
<p>Rippon has also been critical of Mike Pence’s intolerance of the LGBTQ community and reportedly refused to meet the vice president before the games.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, Michelle Kwan’s still got it. </p>
<p>The 37-year-old former Olympian posted a video on social media of herself skating to Keala Settle’s “This Is Me.” </p>
<p>Though it’s been more than a decade since she’s skated competitively, Kwan still slays on the ice. </p>
<p>In the video, Kwan glides across the rink, looking as graceful and elegant as ever. The skater wrote in her post that Settle’s song reminds her of “an Olympian’s journey to the Games” ― something she knows all too well as she’s competed in the Winter Olympics twice, earning silver and bronze medals. </p>
<p>According to a video from October, the former Olympian also can still nail double axels ― after not practicing jumps for seven years. </p>
<p>While Kwan can still skate like a star, she’s actually been busy being a boss in a completely different field. After her competitive skating career, she got a master’s degree from Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. She worked as a senior adviser to the State Department under the Obama administration and then as an outreach coordinator on Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, W Magazine reports. </p>

<p>Figure skating is an incredible mix of athleticism, grace and strength. But much like diving and tennis, the sport occasionally produces some pretty funny faces.</p>
<p>Already, the figure skating events at the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, have provided some pretty great content and unforgettable looks.</p>
<p>Photographers captured the world’s best figure skaters hurling themselves into the air, twirling into a tizzy and gliding around on the ice. Though skaters mostly make their dizzying jumps looks effortless, their faces sometimes say otherwise. </p>

<p>Finnish snowboard coach Antti Koskinen is up to his old tricks at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Or should that be knits?</p>
<p>On Saturday, Koskinen was caught on camera knitting at the top of the slopestyle course in Pyeongchang, South Korea, as athlete Roope Tonteri was waiting to compete, reports Yahoo.</p>
<p>Tweeters couldn’t believe their eyes:</p>
<p>If Koskinen knitting on the slopes seems a familiar sight, that’s because it is. He attempted to keep himself and his athletes calm in a similar fashion during the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, per BuzzFeed. He also became a meme.</p>
<p>The Finnish Olympic team confirmed via Twitter that Koskinen was keeping up with his knitting skills, but didn’t reveal exactly what he was creating.</p>

<p>The U.S. women’s hockey team has had four years to live down an overtime loss to archrival Canada in the gold-medal game at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the squad took to the ice again in its opening match against Finland at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>The top-seeded Americans got off to a rocky start, falling behind in the first period. But they rebounded for a 3-1 victory.</p>
<p>Monique Lamoureux-Morando tied the game at 1-1 in the second period. </p>
<p>Kendall Coyne notched what would be the winning goal in the second period.</p>
<p>Dani Cameranesi scored an empty-net goal with 13 seconds to play.</p>
<p>On the negative side, the Americans’ struggling offense required 42 shots to reach their tally.</p>
<p>“You would like to come out and score a whole bunch more, but as Finland does, they play very tough,” U.S. Coach Robb Stauber told Reuters. “We expected it and weren’t surprised by it at all.”</p>
<p>But they’ll take it.</p>
<p>“We’ve been focused on Feb. 11, our first game of this tournament, for the last four years,” team captain Meghan Duggan had told the Los Angeles Times.</p>

<p>Speed skater Semen Elistratov, the first athlete from Russia to win a medal at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, is reportedly under investigation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after he dedicated his accomplishment to compatriots he said had been banned from the Winter Games in a “such a hard and unfair way.”</p>
<p>“I have difficulties to hold back my tears,” Elistratov said at a press conference following his third-place finish in the men’s 1500m short track speed skating event on Saturday, according to The Guardian. “I am incredibly happy that I did it, in spite of all the circumstances around Russian sport. I dedicate this medal to all guys that have been excluded from these Games in such a hard and unfair way. This medal is for you.”</p>
<p>The BBC reported that the IOC ― which banned Russia from competing at the Winter Olympics over its state-backed doping program ― was investigating Elistratov’s comments because of their apparently political nature. As one of the athletes competing at Pyeongchang under the banner of the Olympic Athletes from Russia team, Elistatrov must follow strict IOC guidelines, including not wearing his country’s colors and refraining from “any public form of publicity, activity and communication associated with the national flag, anthem, emblem and symbol.”</p>
<p>“We have a surveillance program looking at the action and behavior of the OAR team and they will report back at the end of the Games to the executive board to see if not just the letter but the spirit of the law has been breached,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams told the BBC. “It’s for that expert team to look at it.”</p>
<p>As CNN noted, Elistratov was suspended from skating in 2016 after the banned heart drug meldonium was found in his system. He was later granted amnesty by the World Anti-Doping Agency, which determined that low concentrations of the drug found in samples before March 1, 2016, were acceptable. </p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Canada’s Mark McMorris left everything out on the course during Sunday’s slopestyle final, securing a second Olympic bronze medal and completing a heroic comeback from injury.</p>
<p>Riding in the back country with his brother Craig in March, the then-23-year-old caught an edge as he took off for a jump and spiralled into a tree.</p>
<p>McMorris broke his jaw and left arm, ruptured his spleen, suffered a pelvic fracture, rib fractures and a collapsed lung.</p>
<p>The injuries were so severe that McMorris feared he might lose his life.</p>
<p>Now though he is back on an Olympic podium and the 24-year-old believes this medal means more to him than the bronze from Sochi four years ago.</p>
<p>“It feels pretty special to stand on this podium again after everything,” said McMorris after his final run.</p>
<p>“Not getting to participate much over the past couple of years has been pretty tough but really pumped to land a run that was definitely gold medal worthy if there were a little less sketches but I am stoked to put it down.”</p>
<p>“I need to pinch myself because I should have some permanent damage from what my accident entailed.”</p>
<p>Speaking to Reuters before the Olympics, McMorris had said the injuries had given him a new outlook on life.</p>
<p>These thoughts were still present after Sunday’s final, won by American Redmond Gerard, as McMorris said he was just pleased to be healthy and riding once again.</p>
<p>“I think it doesn’t really matter (what medal you get) as long as you are out here riding and boarding as good as you can,” enthused McMorris.</p>
<p>“There is nothing to worry about. The judging is out of your hands and so you just have to try your best and that is what I did and I was rewarded.”</p>

<p>  PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - American Redmond Gerard claimed the United States’ first gold medal of the Pyeongchang Winter Games on Sunday with his victory in the snowboarding slopestyle competition. Gerard scored a run of 87.16 to hold off Canadians Max Parrot and Mark McMorris, who finished second and third respectively. The 17-year-old Gerard, the youngest in the competition, landed a perfect backside triple cork 1440 on his final run and despite Parrot landing the same trick on the final run of the day the judges favoured the American. Gerard believes taking a risk in the final run was the difference between himself and Parrot. “I haven’t had time for it to sink in yet,” Gerard told reporters minutes after the final result.  </p>
<p>  “I just look for different lines. I thought about (taking an easier line) but then I realised my trick over (the second jump), going straight over, isn’t as good so I probably would have got fourth or fifth. So I might as well try and do good.” In a later news conference, Gerard said he was already looking forward and would be taking a break from competition after the Olympics to make snowboarding films.  </p>
<p>  DOWN TO FINAL RUN Every boarder had three cracks at the course, with each athlete’s result calculated as the best score of the three as assessed by the nine judges. Despite frigid temperatures of -13 Celsius, the sun shone down on the fans gathered at the foot of the slope to cheer on the riders. However, it was a strong cross-wind of 2 m/s, combined with nerves, that caused problems for the athletes on their first run. Over half the competitors suffered a fall on the first run, including a heavy fall for Parrot, before New Zealand’s Carlos Garcia Knight kick-started the competition with a switch backside 1260 on the final kicker to lead after the first heat. He would never improve on that to finish fifth. With rivals Sebastien Toutant, Gerard and Parrot still struggling to land a clean run, McMorris took control of the contest with a spectacular second run, finishing with a backside triple cork 1620 to score 85.20 and take the lead. Gerard raised the bar with his backside triple cork 1440 during his final run to take the lead off McMorris and the Canadian couldn’t respond, falling on the final kicker. Parrot landed the same trick on his third run but could only score 86.00 to finish second. Afterwards, Parrot admitted to feeling the pressure going into the final run of the morning. “I felt a lot of pressure, especially after bailing my first two runs and not putting a score down. I had to land this run so the pressure was at its maximum level but I think I dealt pretty well with it,” Parrot told reporters.  </p>
<p>  “I knew my run would be on the podium so with that being said I was happy and when the score came out and I was second it was something very special.” It was a disappointing day for Norway, who had three riders in the competition. Sochi Games silver medallist Staale Sandbech was fourth, with teenage sensation Marcus Kleveland a disappointing sixth. (Reporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty)  </p>

<p>Austria’s David Gleirscher took gold and Germany’s Johannes Ludwig bronze.</p>
<p>You think Mazdzer’s happy?</p>
<p>Mazdzer finished 13th in two previous Winter Games, so this was quite a step up.</p>

<p> The event premiered at the 1964 Winter Olympics. That’s a lot of Olympics ago.</p>

<p>The Pyeongchang Olympics may have broken the record for the most condoms to ever be distributed at the Winter Games, but at least one competitor — U.S. figure skater Adam Rippon — has expressed disappointment at the “generic” contraceptive. </p>
<p>In an Instagram Story posted Saturday, Rippon shared some “disappointing news” with his 143,000 followers about what he referred to as the “condom drama.”</p>
<p>“Like, I’m not entirely sure what I was expecting. I thought maybe they’d have like Olympic rings on them or they’d be all different colors, but, no. It’s all a myth,” Rippon said, his tone deadpan.</p>
<p>“And I’m not, like, upset,” the 28-year-old continued, pausing for effect. “I’m disappointed.”</p>
<p>Rippon stressed, however, that he was taking the matter in stride. </p>
<p>“It’s alright. Life isn’t always what it seems and sometimes the condoms are just generic,” he said. “And sometimes they’re not only just generic, sometimes they’re only available at the polyclinic outside the gym. And that’s okay.” </p>
<p>Earlier this month, news emerged that some 110,000 condoms would be distributed at the Pyeongchang Games — the most of any Winter Olympics in history. If divvied up between the 2,925 athletes competing at the games, that works out to about 37 condoms for each one.</p>
<p>According to Korea Biomedical Review, South Korean condom maker Convenience donated 100,000 of the condoms, worth more than $93,000, and the Korean Association for AIDS Prevention donated an additional 10,000.</p>
<p>Distribution of condoms at an Olympics is a tradition that stretches back to at least 1988, when condoms were made freely available at that year’s Summer Games in Seoul to prevent the spread of HIV, reported Time magazine. At the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, 100,000 condoms were distributed; two years later, at Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, 450,000 were made available.</p>
<p>Rippon is one of Team USA’s first two openly gay athletes competing in the Winter Olympics. He recently made headlines for reportedly refusing to meet Mike Pence over the vice president’s ant-LGBTQ record.</p>

<p>American siblings Maia and Alex Shibutani finished an impressive second in the short dance of the figure skating team competition Sunday at the Winter Olympics ― leaving many amazed at how a brother and sister could apparently get along so well on the ice.</p>
<p>“Saturday Night Live” comedian Leslie Jones summed it up in a characteristically wonderful tweet:</p>
<p>But get along they did. In their first competitive appearance at Pyeongchang, South Korea, the “Shib Sibs” helped Team USA to the bronze medal position in the team event behind Russia and the leader, Canada.</p>
<p>Given their performance Sunday (Pyeongchang local time) in the team event, the Shibutanis looked primed to improve on their ninth-place ice-dance finish at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>“We felt that the skate was actually really good,” Maia Shibutani said of their routine Sunday, according to U.S. Figure Skating. “We’ve been training so hard, and to be out on Olympic ice for the first time, we are really happy with it.”</p>
<p>Alex and Maia, 26 and 23 respectively, have been an ice pair since 2004. Maybe their time has come.</p>
<p>Fans gave ’em lots of love, even if the judges perhaps didn’t.</p>
<p>Even a certain talk show host declared his allegiance to the Shib Sibs. </p>
<p>Alex Shibutani appreciated all the response.</p>

<p>South Korean skater Yura Min’s Olympic debut on Sunday was marred by a performer’s nightmare: A wardrobe malfunction that occurred seconds into her short dance figure skating routine that threatened to reveal just a little too much to the watching world.</p>
<p>But instead of stopping the show in a panic, Min gamely continued her performance with partner Alexander Gamelin, improvising as she went so as to prevent her top from slipping off her shoulders.</p>
<p>Min, who was competing in the figure skating team event, was lauded by viewers for performing — and recovering from the wardrobe near-disaster— “with class.”</p>
<p>Min, a dual citizen of South Korea and the United States, told the Detroit Free Press that the hook on her top “came undone” seconds into the routine.</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘Oh no!’” she told the paper. “If that comes undone, the whole [outfit] could just pop off. I was terrified the entire program.”</p>
<p>Min was determined not to stop in the midst of the performance, however, and instead changed her movements so her arms would be kept back, preventing her costume from falling off.</p>
<p>She only paused once, during the twizzles (synchronized side-by-side spins), when her top began slipping off her shoulder. “It started to come down so I had to stop my twizzle and pull it back up,” she told the AP.</p>
<p>Min managed to finish the routine with her outfit still in place. She and Gamelin, who will compete together again at the individual ice dance competition later this month, received 51.97 points for their performance and finished ninth out of 10 teams.</p>
<p>Canada’s Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, the reigning world champions, came in first with 80.51 points.</p>
<p>Correction: Min and Gamelin will be competing in the individual ice dance competition later this month and not the individual pairs event, as was stated in an earlier version of this story.</p>

<p>She stayed cool under pressure.</p>
<p>Maame Biney, the first black woman on the U.S. Olympic speedskating team, advanced Saturday in the 500-meter short-track event with a veteran-like performance in the first round at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>Biney finished second in her heat (43.665 seconds), behind Fan Kexin (43.350), but it was her late maneuvering to hold off third-place finisher Kim Alang that sealed her advancement.</p>
<p>Fellow American Lana Gehring failed to qualify. </p>
<p>Biney made the U.S. Olympic short-track team shortly before Erin Jackson, who is also black, earned a spot on the long-track team.</p>
<p>Biney, who will also compete in the 1,500 meters, told HuffPost before the games that she was looking forward to the food in South Korea ― but now she has a 500-meter quarterfinal on Tuesday to look forward to as well.</p>
<p>“I don’t really feel pressure to be the first to get a medal or anything like that,” Binley said earlier. “I just want to go out there, do my best and have fun, and experience the Olympics. That’s what I’m here for. I’m here to win, obviously, but also have fun.” </p>
<p>Mission accomplished, so far. </p>

<p>He just didn’t want to risk it.</p>
<p>Defending Olympic halfpipe gold medalist Iouri Podladtchikov announced he was dropping out of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, so he can heal from a head injury he sustained last month.</p>
<p>“My brain needs time to recover from the bruises and I will not be able to compete,” he wrote in a tweet posted Saturday. </p>
<p>Podladtchikov, nicknamed I-Pod, did practice Friday at Phoenix Snow Park, as seen here:</p>
<p>But the Swiss athlete felt something was amiss.</p>
<p>“After all the tests that I have had on the way to the present day in the last two weeks ― including my first practice this Friday ― I can say for sure that starting and participating in the Olympic Games is in no way safe or responsible,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The men’s halfpipe begins on Tuesday.</p>
<p> Podladtchikov captured gold at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and was returning as one of the favorites in South Korea. But a hard fall on his face at X Games Aspen, Colorado, in late January (see below) has ended his hopes of another gold medal. </p>

<p>Sweden’s Charlotte Kalla got her tactics exactly right in Saturday’s Olympic women’s skiathlon as she made her break for gold, but coach Johan Granath was left on tenterhooks to see if her timing would pay off.</p>
<p>Kalla, who was runner-up to Norway’s Marit Bjoergen in Sochi in 2014, made her break at the start of the final lap, opening up a lead that saw her cross the finish line 7.8 seconds ahead of her Norwegian rival to take the first gold of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>“The tactic was to take it easy on the freestyle part and try to be at the front of the field, and then go for it, either here in the stadium or where she did it,” Granath told Reuters.</p>
<p>“You never know how a race will develop ― she could have easily had Marit or Krista (Parmakoski, who finished third) with her, and then she would have had to go in the next hill, or the next hill,” he explained.</p>
<p>Granath had no need to worry as Kalla was never in danger of being reeled in by Bjoergen, whose silver made her the first woman to win 11 medals at the Olympic Winter Games.</p>

<p>Johnny Weir made it clear Saturday he’s from the tell-it-like-it-is school of broadcasting.</p>
<p>Weir, a figure skating analyst for NBC at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, earned plenty of attention for his criticism of the athletes during the first night of the team event on Thursday.</p>
<p>“I’m a commentator, not a ‘complimentator,’ ” he wrote on Twitter Saturday.</p>
<p>On Thursday, he dubbed the performance of U.S. star Nathan Chen as “the worst short program I’ve ever seen” from him and added “disaster” to boot. He also said of the top contenders as a whole, “Nobody skated up to their names.”</p>
<p>Weir, a two-time Olympian who teams with the also-blunt former gold medalist Tara Lipinski on the air, warned viewers that he isn’t about to let up. </p>
<p>The team competition resumes on Sunday (local Pyeongchang time), so expect more shade-throwing to come.</p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said on Friday it has dismissed 47 appeals from Russian athletes and coaches to participate in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, which open later in the day.</p>
<p>The Russians had appealed their exclusion from the games by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) over the doping scandal from the 2014 Sochi Games but the decision now puts an end to any hopes of a quick Olympic return.</p>
<p>“In its decisions, the CAS arbitrators have considered that the process created by the IOC to establish an invitation list of Russian athletes to compete as Olympic athletes from Russia (OAR) could not be described as a sanction but rather as an eligibility decision,” it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The IOC in December banned Russia from the games over doping in the country that included massive manipulation of doping samples at the Sochi Olympics and more than 1,000 athletes across several sports.</p>
<p>It also banned dozens of athletes from the games for life and stripped their Sochi Games medals following several investigations into the doping affair.</p>
<p>“We welcome this decision which supports the fight against doping and brings clarity for all athletes,” an IOC spokesperson said on Friday.</p>
<p>Days earlier CAS had upheld the appeal of 28 athletes due to insufficient evidence but the IOC still refused to invite them saying the evidence was there.</p>
<p>Instead it invited 169 carefully screened Russian athletes to compete as neutrals under the Olympic flag. It has also suspended the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC).</p>
<p>“Although the ROC was suspended, the IOC nevertheless chose to offer individual athletes the opportunity to participate in the Winter Games under prescribed conditions - a process that was designed to balance the IOC’s interest in the global fight against doping and the interests of individual athletes from Russia.”</p>
<p>Among those appealing on Friday were athletes who were not sanctioned for doping in their careers and were not named specifically in the investigations but were still excluded from the games, with the IOC saying the evidence was there as was suspicion of wrong-doing.</p>
<p>Konstantin Vybornov, spokesman for the Olympic athletes from Russia in Pyeongchang, told Reuters he could not immediately comment on the CAS ruling.</p>
<p>The games begin later on Friday and run to Feb. 25.</p>

<p>PYEONGCHANG, South Korea, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The Winter Olympics sparked to life in a vivid, colorful ceremony of fire and ice in South Korea on Friday, and the diplomacy was just as choreographed in the stadium where leaders from nations that are sworn enemies sat close together.</p>
<p>South Korea, which is using the Pyeongchang Games to break the ice with North Korea, seated its president alongside U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, with two of the North’s most senior officials sitting in the row behind.</p>
<p>President Moon Jae-in, who wants to harness the Olympic spirit to pave the way for talks over the North’s nuclear and missile program, shook hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s sister as well as the North’s nominal head of state.</p>
<p>The South is still technically at war with the North after the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, and the United States and the North have recently swapped nuclear threats.</p>
<p>Underlining Moon’s efforts to re-engage with the North, the opening ceremony followed the story line of children wandering through a mythical, snowy landscape and discovering a world where people live in peace and harmony.</p>
<p>The Olympics have provided some respite from years of tense relations between Seoul and Pyongyang, though just hours before the ceremony hundreds of anti-North Korean protesters scuffled with riot police outside the stadium, burning North Korean flags and pictures of its leader, Kim Jong Un.</p>
<p>South Korea’s frigid February, where temperatures have plummeted to minus 20 degrees Celsius (-4 Fahrenheit) at night, has come as a shock to the system for athletes and visitors alike in the leadup to these Games, prompting concerns about hypothermia at the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>The weather was a little milder than forecast on Friday, but spectators still huddled near heaters, holding hot packs and slurping down steaming fishcake soup to ward off the chills.</p>
<p>Bundled up in a scarf, mask and knitted hat, with hot packs tucked into her knee blanket, office worker Shin Hye-sook said she and her three colleagues were coping with the cold.</p>
<p>“It’s okay unless the wind blows,” said the 60-year-old. “We’re sitting as close as we can and trying not to move a lot to save our energy.” (Writing by Peter Rutherford, Additional reporting by James Pearson, Hyunjoo Jin and Jane Chung; Editing by Mark Bendeich)</p>

<p>Perhaps you pride yourself on your Winter Olympics knowledge, and you’re eager to show it off to friends and family now that the games have started.</p>
<p>Just make sure you’re also pronouncing the name of host city Pyeongchang correctly.</p>
<p>It’s “Pee-yung-chong” (saying it quickly), linguist James Harbeck says in the video below. For those who find the clip full of TMI, you can fast-forward to the 2:55 mark. You’ll learn how to pronounce some of the other Olympics venues as well.</p>
<p>In the video below, a Korean woman (at the 1:40 mark) says Pyeongchang in a way that seems to somewhat support Harbeck’s version, but with a “t” sound to start the last syllable.</p>

<p>Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn teared up while speaking of her beloved late grandfather during a news conference Friday in Pyeongchang, South Korea.</p>
<p>Don Kildow, 88, died in November. A skier himself, Kildow is one of the reasons Vonn took up the sport. He served in the Korean War with the Army Corps of Engineers. </p>
<p>“I miss him so much,” said Vonn, who has posted often about her grandfather on Instagram lately.</p>
<p>The 33-year-old two-time medal winner ― one gold and one bronze ― is set to compete in her fourth Winter Olympics this month in South Korea. She missed the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, because of an injured knee.</p>
<p>Vonn, who says this will be her final appearance in the Olympics, will compete in three events at this year’s games: downhill, super-giant slalom and combined events.</p>
<p>“I know he’s watching and I know he’s gonna help me,” she said. “And I’m gonna win for him.”</p>

<p>Feb 9 (Reuters) - United States bobsledder Steven Holcomb’s untimely death last year shocked the fraternity and brought them closer, members of the team said on Friday.</p>
<p>Holcomb, 37, who came back from a suicide attempt over impending blindness to win Olympic gold in 2010, was found dead in his room at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid, New York in May.</p>
<p>“We’ve become more than a team, we’ve become a brotherhood that I haven’t seen in the past 10 years in the sport. It’s just how we all came together,” Nick Cunningham, who will compete in two-man and four-man events, said on Friday.</p>
<p>“We’re all suffering together and the best way to honor Holcomb’s legacy is to carry it on, to always be that threat on the hill, always put in that work and honor him by what we’re doing behind the scenes,” he added.</p>
<p>Steven Langton, who won gold along with Holcomb in the 2012 World Championships in Lake Placid, said the team was sporting rubber bracelets to honor his legacy.</p>
<p>“It’s just a simple rubber band but it’s something that you never have to take off and it’s a way to remember our friend and brother. Most of us in some capacity got into this sport of bobsled because of Steve, had success because of Steve.”</p>
<p>Langton won a bronze medal with Holcomb in the two-man event in the Sochi Olympics before it was re-designated silvers after the Russian team was disqualified following a doping scandal.</p>
<p>“I’d like to say this year has been really hard for everyone,” Samuel McGuffie added. “I owe a lot of my success now to Holcomb. He’ll be greatly missed from now until eternity.”</p>
<p>Carlo Valdes, who joined the U.S. team in 2014, said he had talked extensively with Holcomb ahead of the Pyeongchang Games.</p>

<p>The Olympics opening ceremony will kick off Friday evening in Pyeongchang, South Korea, launching the highly anticipated Winter Games. People from all around the world will look on as more than 2,000 athletes from 92 countries compete for their national pride. </p>
<p>Here’s a look at the games by the numbers: </p>
<p>Bigger Than Ever Before</p>
<p>You know that little tidbit about the 92 countries competing in this year’s Olympics? Well, that’s a record. There are six new countries appearing in this year’s games: Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore. </p>
<p>The 2018 Winter Olympics will have more than 100 medal events. The International Olympic Committee added four new events this year: curling mixed doubles, speedskating mass start, snowboarding big air, and alpine skiing team event. </p>
<p>Team USA is the biggest it’s ever been before, too. Actually, it’s bigger than any Winter Olympic team in history. There are 242 U.S. athletes on the roster for 2018, beating its previous record of 222 competitors at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. </p>
<p>Olympic-Sized Price Tags</p>
<p>Hosting an international sporting event is no cheap endeavor. The 2018 Winter Olympics will cost the South Korean government an estimated $13 billion dollars. Of course, the event itself typically makes enormous revenue, between ticket sales, licensing deals, incoming tourism and international sponsorships.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, $13 billion is downright affordable in comparison to the most expensive games in history. The last Winter Games, in Sochi, Russia, cost nearly $22 billion, even though the anticipated budget was originally around $5 billion. That number jumps to $55 billion after including the post-game costs of maintaining the Olympic stadium. </p>
<p>Who Has More Medals? </p>
<p>Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen is representing her country this year with the most medals going into the game. Bjørgen will enter the Olympics with 10 medals: six gold, three silver, and one bronze. </p>
<p>She has a chance to beat her countryman, biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen, for the title of most decorated Winter Olympic athlete in the history of the games. (Team USA’s 28-time medalist, Michael Phelps, is still the most decorated Olympian of all time, though.)  </p>
<p>Age Ain’t Nothing But A Number</p>
<p>This year’s youngest Olympian is China’s Wu Meng, a 15-year-old halfpipe skier. Team USA’s youngest athlete, 17-year-old figure skater Vincent Zhou, is only slightly older than Wu, but both are significantly older than gymnast Dimitrios Loundras. Loundras was only 10 years old when he won the bronze for Greece in 1896 in Athens. </p>
<p>Canadian curler Cheryl Bernard, 51, will be the oldest athlete entering the games. If Bernard, a team alternate, doesn’t actually compete in the games, then 49-year-old Finnish curler Tomi Rantamaeki will take the honor. </p>
<p>In addition to the curlers, this year’s Team USA hockey players will be a bit older than usual. The National Hockey League instituted a rule that none of its active players will be allowed to compete in this year’s Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>So Team USA pulled from the pool of retired or non-contracted players this year, as opposed to stacking the team with college athletes. That’s resulted in the third-oldest Team USA hockey roster in the last 38 year years, according to FiveThirtyEight.</p>

<p>When John Urschel retired from the NFL last year after just 3 seasons with the Baltimore Ravens, it made headlines. In recent years, several young players, including Chris Borland of the 49ers, have bowed out of the sport early due to growing concerns over the potential for long-term brain damage, but Urschel’s motivation was different: he just didn’t have time for football anymore. He was getting a PhD in math at MIT. </p>
<p>The idea of a 300-pound offensive lineman trading in his helmet for a protractor obviously generated a lot of interest, as well as a lot of bad math/football puns. Now, Urschel has quietly set himself a new goal: he wants to become a chess master.</p>
<p>You might think someone who spends his days studying Laplacian eigenvectors would pick a hobby that’s a little more restful on the brain. But for Urschel, the appeal of math and the appeal of chess are very similar. “As a mathematician, I really like to understand the structure of things,” he says. “[Chess] is very mathematical to me. You’re playing a game, you’re faced with some position, you’re trying to figure out the way to proceed, and you don’t really know in most cases if I play this move or that move, if that’s winning, if it’s losing, if it’s drawing... It doesn’t feel that much different from being faced with a mathematical problem and trying to reason your way through.”</p>
<p>Urschel has set himself the goal of earning the National Master title, which is awarded by the US Chess Federation to players who reach a certain rating level. While the “NM” title falls well below the prestigious Grandmaster title given out by FIDE (the International Chess Federation) it’s still a heavy lift for someone who’s getting a PhD and raising a child at the same time. Nevertheless, Urschel thinks he can do it. So does Daniel Rensch, Vice President of Chess.com, the most popular online chess site. “I would be surprised if he doesn’t make master in the next five years,” he says.</p>
<p>The two met sometime last year, when Urschel reached out to Rensch on Twitter. Rensch is an International Master (the second-highest title bestowed by FIDE), and was one of the top junior players in his youth. “[Urschel] said he was a big fan of Chesscenter, which is a show that we do, a monthly sports-style recap of all the biggest stories in chess,” recalls Rensch. “At first I was like, ‘who’s this?’ Then I click and I’m like, ‘oh crap, this is an NFL star.’ And then I found out John is one of the most interesting people on the planet.”</p>
<p>Intrigued by the idea of an ex-NFL player who wanted to become a chess master, Rensch made himself Urschel’s unofficial mentor. Nowadays you can often see them together on Chess.com’s youtube channel, like in this video where Rensch gives Urschel a calculation lesson:</p>
<p>In July, Chess.com organized a “celebrity chess match” between Urschel and Shaun Hutchinson, or “Hutch”, a popular eSports streamer and commentator who dabbles in chess. “At the time our ratings on Chess.com were comparable,” says Urschel. “It seemed like a cool thing to do.”</p>
<p>After losing the first game, Urschel surged to a blowout victory by winning the next eleven in a row ― but he’s charitable to his vanquished foe. “I won but I want to stress that the score did not represent our talent levels,” he told me. “He very much went on tilt, as people do. People go on tilt, things happen.”</p>
<p>After I spoke to Urschel on the phone for this article, I challenged him to a quick game on Chess.com. He accepted. It was a tense game, with both sides holding the advantage at various points. Urschel managed his clock better than me and I lost on time in the endgame (in timed games, the first player whose clock runs out loses). I showed our game to Daniel Rensch to see if he had any thoughts. After offering me some tips on my own play, he turned to Urschel’s. Get ready for some chess jargon.</p>
<p>“I think John’s biggest mistake was that after e5 on move 19 he should’ve played d5,” he told me. “If he responds with d5 there he’s got a really strong passed pawn in the center, and it leaves your bishop on f6 blocked by your own e-pawn. John has a tendency to like trading pieces, because he really likes the endgame, but it means he can misplay some middlegame space advantages. I’ve worked with him on this.”</p>
<p>Getting to master level means meticulously identifying and ironing out those weaknesses, one by one. “I think it’s totally realistic that he can make master in 3 to 4 years,” says Rensch. “In that way I am both his biggest cheerleader and his biggest critic. Because I do push him to challenge his own weaknesses and not to be comfortable. John loves the game, he loves the scientific aspects of it, and he’s willing to work hard. But whether he’s able to fully embrace the gamesmanship aspect of it will be a big determining factor. I think John is already on the way to having a master-level understanding of the game. But he’s not there yet.”</p>
<p>In 2015, after Chris Borland’s retirement due to concerns over football-related brain damage, Urschel published a piece in the Players’ Tribune defending his decision to keep playing the game. “Objectively, I shouldn’t,” he admitted. So why not quit? “I love hitting people,” he said simply. For Urschel, there was just no replacing the rush of physically dominating another player.</p>
<p>Two years later, growing academic and family commitments had changed the calculation. While it seems unlikely chess will be able to fill that very specific void in his life, Urschel has developed enough of a passion for the game to keep pushing toward a master title. “By the end of 2020 I think seems like a reasonable goal,” he says. “Hopefully by then I’ll have something to celebrate.”</p>

<p>Pita Taufatofua, whose oiled torso wowed the world at the opening ceremony for the 2016 Summer Olympics, returned to the Olympic stage in the same fashion at Friday’s opening ceremony for the Winter Games.</p>
<p>It was below freezing in Pyeongchang, South Korea, as Taufatofua strutted through the stadium like it was, well, a day at the beach.</p>
<p>Taufatofua made these Games as a cross-country skier by qualifying in mostly dry-land roller events. He’s not a contender ― just as he wasn’t when he lost in the first round in taekwondo in Rio ― but, man, he just struck gold in the kick-off event again.</p>

<p>The mother of Pittsburgh Pirates catcher Elias Diaz has been kidnapped in Venezuela.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Pirates issued a statement confirming Venezuelan media reports that Ana Soto, Diaz’s mother, was in danger.</p>
<p>Diaz, 27, reportedly is in the United States as Pirates’ pitchers and catchers prepare to report to spring training next week. He hit .223 with one home run and 19 RBIs in 64 games last season.</p>
<p>This is not the first time kidnappers have targeted Venezuelan athletes or their relatives. In 2009, then-Colorado Rockies catcher Yorvit Torrealba waited in anguish as his 11-year-old son was rescued from kidnappers. Former Washington Nationals catcher Wilson Ramos was kidnapped in 2011 but later was found alive and unharmed after an air rescue.</p>

<p>American speed skater Shani Davis was not pleased about how Team USA selected its flag-bearer for the opening ceremony of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>The two-time Olympic champion expressed his frustration on Twitter after he missed out on the honor to women’s luge veteran Erin Hamlin.</p>
<p>“@TeamUSA dishonorably tossed a coin to decide its 2018 flag bearer,” Davis wrote on Thursday. “No problem. I can wait until 2022.”</p>
<p>Davis, who was the first black athlete to win individual gold at a Winter Olympics at the 2006 Turin Games also captioned his post with the #BlackHistoryMonth2018 hashtag.</p>
<p>The coin toss followed a 4-4 tie between Davis and Hamlin after athletes from the U.S. Olympic Committee’s eight different sports federations involved in the Winter Games cast their votes. No evidence was offered to suggest that the toss was altered or weighted in any way.</p>
<p>Pyeongchang marks Davis’ fifth Winter Olympics. It will be Hamlin’s fourth. Neither athlete has made further comment on Davis’ tweet.</p>
<p>Hamlin said she was “incredibly proud” to lead the team.</p>

<p>Transmitting an overriding message of peace and harmony, the dazzling variety of routines showcased Korean culture, and parts of it were set to a Korean pop music soundtrack.</p>
<p>Technology took a front seat in the ceremony. with the creative use of elements like more than 1,200 drones lighting up the sky to depict athletes in action.</p>
<p>The Olympic flame was lit toward the end of the opening ceremony, declaring the Winter Games officially open.</p>

<p>Boston University hockey player Jordan Greenway will make history in Pyeongchang, South Korea, becoming the first African-American ever to be selected for the U.S. men’s Olympic hockey team.</p>
<p>Breaking that 98-year color barrier, which began in the 1920 Winter Games in Antwerp, Belgium, when men’s ice hockey was first included, is a significant achievement, but Greenway tells NBC Sports that he is just “another kid going to play in the Olympics.”</p>
<p>Greenway says he’s happy to be first and hopes it will inspire young minorities to give hockey a shot.</p>

<p>There’s a whole lot of talent headed to the 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. From breakout stars to seasoned medalists, there are plenty of athletes from many different countries to watch out for.</p>
<p>Here are some of the first-timers and potential record-breakers to keep an eye on this year:</p>
<p>Marit Bjørgen, Norway</p>
<p>With 10 medals under her belt, the Norwegian cross-country skier is the most decorated athlete competing in this year’s games. She also holds the most medals of any female winter athlete. She won three gold medals in each of the past two Winter Games.</p>
<p>Claudia Pechstein, Germany</p>
<p>With nine medals, this German athlete is the most successful Olympic speedskater in history. She will be the first woman to compete in seven Winter Olympics. Pechstein could also become the oldest Winter Olympic medalist in an individual event and the first person to win the same individual Winter Olympic event four times ― she previously won the 5,000 meters in 1994, 1998 and 2002.</p>
<p>Ireen Wüst, The Netherlands</p>
<p>The Dutch speedskater won two gold medals and three silvers at the Sochi Games in 2014 ― more than any athlete in any sport that year. Wüst is one gold medal short of having the record for most golds ever won by an Olympic speedskater. In 2006, at the age of 19, she become the youngest Dutch Olympic champion in Winter Games history.</p>
<p>Mikaela Shiffrin, U.S.A.</p>
<p>Many view the 22-year-old American as the best skier in the world right now. At 18, she became the youngest-ever Olympic alpine gold medalist. She already has 41 World Cup wins under her belt. If she manages to take home more than two gold medals in alpine skiing this year, she would beat Janica Kostelić of Croatia’s 2002 record. </p>
<p>Noriaki Kasai, Japan</p>
<p>The 45-year-old Japanese ski jumper has the most Winter Olympic appearances of any athlete competing this year. This will be his eighth time at the Winter Games. He is the oldest ski jumper to medal at the Olympics ― he’s won three medals but no gold. He’s said his goal is for his two-year-old daughter to see him win gold.</p>
<p>Adam Rippon, U.S.A.</p>
<p>At 28, the American athlete is the oldest U.S. figure-skating Olympic rookie since 1936. Rippon is also the first openly gay man to compete for the United States in the Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>Chloe Kim, U.S.A.</p>
<p>The 17-year-old has become a dominant snowboarder in the women’s halfpipe and is expected to take home gold at the Winter Games. If she does, Kim could become the youngest American to win an Olympic medal in snowboarding. The record is now held by Kelly Clark, who won gold in 2002 at the age of 18.</p>

<p>Pyeongchang, South Korea, built itself a brand-new $109 million stadium to host the 2018 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. And after just four ceremonial events ― including Friday’s opening festivities ― Pyeongchang is planning to tear the place down.</p>
<p>Ironically, the idea behind tearing down the stadium is to keep it from becoming an immediate white elephant and ever-present reminder of Olympic excess.</p>
<p>The Pyeongchang Games were supposed to be an example of modesty, a reminder that the Olympics didn’t have to burden its host with the record-breaking $50 billion price tag that accompanied the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia ― and that helped turn much of the world against the idea of hosting the games.</p>
<p>But building a stadium solely to host four ceremonies ― none of which involve actual sports ― feels more like an example of how Pyeongchang fell right into the Olympic trap.</p>
<p>This year’s Winter Olympics will cost an estimated $13 billion ― far short of Sochi’s cost, but still roughly twice what Olympic organizers originally estimated. That maintains an ugly streak for the games: Between 1960 and 2012, every Olympics, winter and summer, has exceeded its initial budget projections, according to researchers at the University of Oxford. The median overrun for the Winter Games, the researchers found, was 109 percent, which means Pyeongchang’s doubling of costs is right in line with budget reality.</p>
<p>Pyeongchang has already warned the South Korean government that the final cost of the games will be too high. Last year, it threatened to slash its own contribution to the Olympic budget.</p>
<p>Those costs rose, as they always do, thanks to largely unnecessary construction projects with little promise of future viability. Organizers built a brand-new ski resort for the Pyeongchang Games, for instance, even though its construction required the partial demolition of a sacred indigenous forest, even though the games have required shuttering other ski resorts, even though there’s little evidence the new site will be used once the Olympics end.</p>
<p>Other Pyeongchang venues share similar legacy concerns. Five months ahead of the games, organizers had no plans at all for post-Olympic use of at least three other newly constructed facilities. On the eve of the games, they still don’t have concrete proposals for the future.</p>
<p>The public justification for hosting these games, in Pyeongchang and across South Korea, is that the first Winter Olympics to grace the Korean Peninsula won’t just improve relations between the North and South but will also boost interest in winter sports and help transform the area “into an Asian winter sports hub.” But who can really predict the first, and the latter seems unlikely.</p>
<p>South Koreans don’t much care for winter sports. In one survey last year, just 35 percent of them reported having any interest in the Olympics, and domestic ticket sales, even for the most popular events, have lagged well behind the normal Olympic pace.</p>
<p>Previous Olympics suggest that the games’ ability to boost participation in sports is nearly as big a myth as their supposed economic and tourism benefits. Organizers of the 2012 London Games really pushed the “sparking public enthusiasm for athletics” goal. Surveys in the six years since have shown that participation in various sports has remained at best steady across the city, while a Parliamentary report last year found that rates of physical activity and sporting participation among children have actually declined since the end of the games.</p>
<p>Concerns about cost and legacy have largely taken a backseat ahead of the Pyeongchang Games for a variety of reasons. The focus on Russia’s doping scandal has sucked up most of the pre-Olympic oxygen. A norovirus outbreak on the eve of the games and the unavoidable security concerns caused by Pyeongchang’s proximity to the North Korean border have absorbed much of the rest. What diplomatic role the 2018 Winter Olympics will play, now and in the future, on the peninsula and in the world seems to be the biggest potential story of the games.</p>
<p>To Pyeongchang’s credit, the city seems ready and the venues complete. There haven’t been any of the major hiccups that typically drive hysteria in the run-up to the Olympics. Indeed, these games feel comparably flawless next to the worries over excessive costs, threats to LGBTQ rights and environmental destruction that surrounded the 2014 Sochi Games; the demolition of poor neighborhoods, the collapsing economy and the lax preparations ahead of Rio de Janeiro’s 2016 Summer Olympics; or the already exorbitant cost increases and environmental problems plaguing Tokyo’s upcoming 2020 Summer Games.</p>
<p>All the normal Olympic features are still present in Pyeongchang: the bloated budget, the environmental degradation, the empty infrastructure legacy. A costly new stadium that will open only four times before it’s ultimately destroyed.</p>
<p>But excess and destruction have become such hallmarks of the Olympics, these hardly feel like problems anymore.</p>

<p>Come for the Olympic figure skating. Stay for Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski’s icy takedowns of the athletes competing at the Winter Games in Pyeongchang. </p>
<p>Even before the Opening Ceremony, the Olympians-turned-analysts gave a chilly reception to many of the skaters performing in the early events. </p>
<p>Weir called one routine “the worst short program I’ve ever seen from Nathan Chen.” </p>
<p>Lipinsky was just as unfiltered, deeming the performance “disastrous.”</p>
<p>And they were just getting warmed up. </p>
<p>Some viewers were thrilled by their comments:</p>
<p>However, not everyone loved it. Some wanted more analysis and less snark: </p>

<p>Just before 2 a.m. on Thursday morning, or about 13 hours before the NBA trade deadline, the human scoop otherwise known as Adrian Wojnarowski faked the basketball world out of its collective pair of shoes, telling his 2 million-plus followers that the fast-approaching deadline was looking like it would be something of a dud. </p>
<p>He was wrong. Around noon on Thursday, the trade deadline quickly ramped up into hyper-speed, when Woj himself sent out another bomb stating that the Cleveland Cavaliers were trading away Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye and a protected 2018 first-round pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Jordan Clarkson and Larry Nance Jr. From there, it only got more obscene. </p>
<p>To try and process the head-spinning ridiculousness of it all, we decided to just open a group chat and process everything together. For transparency’s sake, Travis is a Washington Wizards fan, Ja’han is a Phoenix Suns fan and Maxwell is a Lakers fan. </p>
<p>[1:30 PM]</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: OK, it’s 1:30 p.m. and the Cleveland Cavaliers have just blown up the NBA.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: I still don’t know what to make of it, other than the NBA is magic. This was supposed to be a slow day!</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: The memes have begun.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Only in the NBA ― and only in LeBron World, really ― could we get a game as a dramatic as that Cavs-TimberPups thriller last night ... only to see an entire new Cavs roster tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: </p>
<p>Travis Waldron: I think the Cavs are better now.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: I’ve always loved how, despite the animus folks feel toward ‘Bron, none of us can deny the league revolves around him. He’s literally changing folks’ career trajectory with subtweets and dirty looks.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Is it selfish that I want the Cavs to trade everyone else too?Trade the Nets pick for DeAndre and Love for Kemba, just do it.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Tristan and the Brooklyn pic for DeAndre. Love for ... someone with two hands. Keep J.R., because J.R.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Exactly. I’m loving this Woj tweet from 11 hours ago: </p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Tristan and the Brooklyn pick is too much to give for DeAndre, but you get the point.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Doesn’t matter. Lean in to the insanity ― this is the NBA.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: I think Maxwell and I are in agreement that, entertainment value aside, the Cavs are better positioned for the playoffs now. Ja’han?</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: I agree with that. Their previous roster was full of guys we knew but guys who were never *great* fits with their previous organizations.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: And they all hated each other!!! Thomas’ final moment with the Cavs was getting totally ignored by LeBron after a game-winner. It’s almost poetic. </p>
<p>[1:35 PM]</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: I genuinely aspire toward Isaiah’s self-confidence and self-assuredness.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: They flipped a bunch of parts that weren’t working/didn’t get along/couldn’t trust Kevin Love for three dudes under 25 ... and they kept the Brooklyn pick (so far)! They still royally screwed up the Kyrie trade this summer, but this was about as good as you could do to get out of it. </p>
<p>I think this roster is spicy: </p>
<p>I’d start Hill > Clarkson, though.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I love it for the Cavs. If LeBron leaves, they aren’t making the finals for another decade anyway, might as well go out in firing. Again, I’d throw out the Brooklyn pick and just give it one more go. They are going to have a decade’s worth of top-10 picks post-LeBron anyway.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Hold on I have to check Twitter in case Woj is still bombing us.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: In 16 tweets, Woj broke the internet.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: That man’s end-of-the-day unwinding routine has to be CRAZY.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I would be scared to have that power.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: I’m going to regret saying this but my favorite part of this deadline is still that Ernie Grunfeld hasn’t traded a first-round pick for an aging role player who won’t still be in Washington this summer. Day is young, though.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Just want to make sure this makes it into the post.</p>
<p>And Travis, no one cares about the Wizards.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: How do we think Isaiah fits in LA?</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: That’s a good question.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: He’ll be fun! And if he sucks, LA will move on.</p>
<p>[1:40 PM]</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: It doesn’t matter this year. The question for me is where he ends up this summer. And I’m sorry but lots of people care about the Wizards. Me, John Wall, maybe Bradley Beal. That’s 2.5.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan:  The most likely scenario is he sucks less than he did in Cleveland, then the Lakers move on in order to sign ... LEBRON JAMES.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: By the way, the Cavs just cleared the way for the Lakers to sign LeBron.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: LeBron going to the Lakers is both a nightmare and a dream for me. </p>
<p>Travis Waldron: This is all a ploy to keep LeBron from signing in LA. “Oh, you want to go to the Lakers. We’ll just give the Lakers the guy you hate the most.”</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Strong disagree! Lakers are playing chess. What would LeBron love more than to sign with the Lakers and screw up Thomas’ life once again?</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: I like this move for the Lakers. Even LeBron potential aside.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: I DESPISE the Lakers and wish them nothing but ill, non-injurious will. But the idea of that franchise hanging on the every word of a man they’ve spent a decade loathing brings me some happiness.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: But we have to get back to the central point, which is that LeBron James is quite possibly the most powerful man in the history of pro basketball. The Cavs just flipped their entire roster *with no guarantee that LeBron is going to stay.*</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: For real! Like, after Big O, I think ’Bron is the most influential player in league history when it comes to the business of the league and how players determine their own future.</p>
<p>[1:45 PM]</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Right, Big O is up there. But LeBron has now engineered, what, three of the biggest off-the-court, landscape-shifting days in recent NBA history.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: It’s fine. They gotta go for it.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: The Decision, I’m Coming Home, and now this?</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: And the Lakers now are set up to get Paul George and be able to keep Lonzo, Kuzma, Ingram and Randle</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Stop talking about the Lakers.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Everyone will understand if he leaves. The Lakers are the NBA’s team! People hate [Cavaliers owners Dan] Gilbert enough that I think people won’t be mad if LeBron leaves. Or am I wrong?</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: We’ve got LeBron James blowing up the entire league and you want to talk about Julius Randle. I went to Kentucky and I don’t even care that much about Julius Randle.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: A critical piece of the NBA puzzle! As an aside, Woj mini-alert ...</p>
<p>Sorry, I meant Shams.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Man.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: This is the darkest timeline.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: Damn. What a fall from grace.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: You just disrespected Shams more than Derrick Rose has disrespected his career.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Fun fact: Derrick Rose is the oldest 29-year-old in the world.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Other than you.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: That brother has lived three lifetimes, I swear.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I am convinced Shams and Woj were born in the same petri dish.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Are the Cavs the best team in the East now? I need a live feed on Kyrie.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Let me look at that lineup again</p>
<p>It’s ... not bad?</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Again: I’d start Hill over Clarkson, but Clarkson gives you some late-game flexibility.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: You definitely start Hill.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Nance actually wins the day here. </p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Him and Jordan Clarkson are about to become famous.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: I’ve never wavered in my belief that the Cavs are still better than Boston.</p>
<p>[1:50 PM]</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: They certainly will be better on defense with Nance in the mix. Oh my God. Alert.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: Minnesota is close to home. Might be ... good? Iunno.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Thibs-Rose reunion.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Just what a young team on the cusp of breaking through needs: Derrick Rose. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Derrick Rose is about to play 40 minutes a game until he tears his ACL for the 14th time.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Anyway: The Cavs are going back to the Finals.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Now, yes, I see that. I just can’t believe in the Raptors. And the Celtics rookies are going to go weak in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: But I still don’t think this team is built to challenge Golden State or Houston unless something goes drastically wrong for one of those two.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I love these little updates on deadline day.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Bruno!</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: No one is beating Golden State or Houston.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: After seeing that photo of Demar Derozan with Lil Romeo on their youth team, I just can’t believe in any team he’s on. It’s not fair to him, but that’s where I am.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: </p>
<p> [Our curmudgeonly manager] Tommy Craggs [1:52 PM] Thibs wants to finish the job he startedRose is gonna die at midcourtThat’s the only way for this NBA season to end </p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I can’t see it ending any other way.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: I can’t wait to see the salt levels on Kyrie’s face if the Cavs knock Boston out of the playoffs.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: </p>
<p>Travis Waldron: That’s a bad tweet.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: We’ve reached “corporate jokes” levels of trending.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: I know you love the brands, Maxwell, but leave them out of this.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: The Wolves should grab Deng and Noah too. By the way, there’s no way Thibs will not have run KAT and Wiggins into the ground by the time they are 27.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: It’s going to be so sad when he ruins KAT.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: I still think Noah is serviceable.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Ja’han. Please take that back.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Serviceable at what?</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: Lol, he’s a big man with good court vision. In a league where Zaza exists, there’s room for Joakim. Haha</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I’m pretty sure Noah is just partying in New York.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Anyway, I have to make a phone call. Cavs in 7.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: IN THE FINALS? Are you kidding me.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Necessarily ambiguous. Leave it up to the imagination.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Ridiculous, and I love it.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: There we go! Talk that talk, Travis! I’m still rolling with the Cavs!</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Look, I’m just here for the NBA going fully insane. God bless LeBron.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Travis is trying to end this chat as if something insane isn’t going to happen in the next hour.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: I’ll be back. The NBA is my drug.</p>
<p>[2:00 PM]</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: Dear God.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: What, like, that Kendrick Perkins?</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: The Enforcer.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Back from the dead.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: I just learned that as of two days ago, the Canton Charge’s Kendrick Perkins was planning to retire from the G League. Now he’s going to sit on the plane* next to LeBron. What a world.</p>
<p>*Not ready to assume he gets to sit on the bench.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I love the NBA. </p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: If you get in good with ’Bron, you’re set for LIFE.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: It’s the best thing we, as a country, have.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Knicks get in this!</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Mudiay lives.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: This is very Knicks, but I ... I kind of like it. Depending on what they trade him for. Since it’s the Knicks I’m going to assume it’s for Kristaps.</p>
<p>[2:05 PM]</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Hm.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Every time I see Woj tweet I get excited and now he wants me to care about Devin Harris. ANNOUNCE DEANDRE.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Is this a good trade? I guess I dig this trade for the Knicks. Trade a serviceable role player for a reclamation project that was drafted near the top of the draft just a couple years ago. </p>
<p>(As an aside, from a friend: “i have 10 tabs open and 6 of them are woj tweets.”)</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Who cares.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I’m going to go to my Knicks friends for reactions.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: I don’t care about anything but Tristan for DeAndre.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: It’s happening. I believe.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: I feel for Tristan. Dude never asked to play the five, yet we judge him on his inability to do so. Lol</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Me: “Knicks just traded McDermott for Emanuel mudiay. Immediate reaction?“ Knicks fan friend: “Why?” I guess that says it all.</p>
<p>[2:10 PM]</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: “Who are the Knicks.”</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: To be fair, he’s been rather despondent since Kristaps tore his ACL.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Oh, wait, I like it less now lol.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: You keep telling me about this trade and I forgot that New York or Dallas had NBA teams. @wojespn, announce DeAndre.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Missed this, but good. </p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: Astute observation, Joel. </p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I feel like DeAndre has been on the trading block since the first years of the Obama administration.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: Literally.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Posted at 10:03 a.m.:</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Damn. We should have known Isaiah was gone last night when he was waving his arms at the top of the key in OT and LeBron just ducked his head and went to the rack. 1 on 3.</p>
<p>[2:15 PM]</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: Lol, “I got this one, lil fella.”</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I’m so old I remember when LeBron was considered the greatest teammate in the league two years ago. </p>
<p>Travis Waldron: When your guy decides to go at Andrew Wiggins and Karl Towns by himself without even looking at you, you gotta see the writing on the wall.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: </p>
<p>Travis Waldron: My god.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Has anyone ever killed more of the goodwill surrounding them than I.T. in the last, oh, 10 months?</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Isaiah has had a worse past 365 days than the United States.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I.T. has been on the Lakers for like 5 minutes and he’s already ruining everything.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: My man just won’t let ANYONE tell him he’s better as a bench guy. He needs to take the Lou Williams route. I’m waiting for the Big Baller Brand-Isaiah chat.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: I need a LaVar-Isaiah Facebook show ASAP.</p>
<p>[2:20 PM]</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Kill me.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Isaiah is gonna end up in Lithuania with LeMelo and LiAngelo before Easter.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: And that would be an optimistic outcome. Is Isaiah Thomas going to be happy backing up 20-year-old rookie Lonzo Ball? (That was a joke.)</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Was it?</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I love when Woj sprinkles in a silly little trade like this. Lightens the mood.</p>
<p> [2:25 PM]</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: NOOOOOO.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Oh, come on.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: Drat.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Thirty more minutes. I think Woj has one more bomb in him.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: That means ... Oubre for DAJ is happening. I’m going to hate the NBA by the end of this.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: Where is Kyle Singler going to end up? That’s the real question.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I feel like there will be some automated high-frequency trades in the final 60 seconds. Ja’han always asks the right questions.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: I know everyone is wondering.</p>
<p>[2:30 PM]</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Here’s another guy who has had one foot out the door for a half-decade.</p>
<p>[2:35 PM]</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: My friend who doesn’t spend all day on the internet just texted: “Isaiah a laker?” What a tranquil life he leads.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: Wow, what a blessing.</p>
<p>[2:40 PM]</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: I’ve missed a bunch of Cavs games lately. Do either of you brothers know whether Cedi Osman is developing well?</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I literally have no idea. I just know LeBron jumped into his embrace last night.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: This is true. He’s earned the King’s blessing. He’s set.</p>
<p>[2:45 PM]</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Fifteen minutes left, and it’s quiet. Too quiet.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Still time for Ernie to ruin everything.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Assuming nothing else happens, who is the biggest winner here? You can say it, it’s fine.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: Suns. Kept Jared Dudley happy by literally doing nothing.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Wrong. I believe the Lakers won. Going to just step outside my box and say that. Today, we not only obtained a first-round pick, but essentially signed Paul George and LeBron James.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Short-term, over the next few months, I think Cleveland did a thing that counts as a win, but that’s largely because they did an offseason that was a loss. But I think they’re better positioned to win the East today than they were yesterday. Long-term, the Lakers had a good day.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Thank you Travis. Thank you for speaking truth to power.</p>
<p>[2:50 PM]</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: I’m ... let’s call it curious ... about what Utah’s process was here.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: I was going to say Lakers, but I hesitated because I don’t know what ultimately happens with that space they’ve made. Cavs today, potentially Lakers down the road assuming they don’t make all-time bad mistakes in the offseason.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Sheldon Mac is not the last-minute explosion I was hoping for.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Also, Joe Johnson is a winner for getting people to keep paying him to play basketball. God bless Joseph Johnson.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: As Bomani Jones says, Joe is a legend at the bank. For real.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: It’s official, and it’s weird. </p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Joe Johnson is the eighth-highest paid NBA player of all time.Joe Johnson has made $214 million.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Travis shut up for a second and let Ja’han digest this:</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: LORD. </p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Joe Johnson has made more money than Chris Bosh or Dwyane Wade. Joe Johnson is not just a legend at the bank, he is a first-ballot Hall of Famer at the bank.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Travis, literally no one cares about Joe Johnson.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: That’s their fault.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Not even Joe Johnson cares about Joe Johnson.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Joe Johnson is the American Dream.</p>
<p>[2:55 PM]</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: </p>
<p>Travis Waldron: That’s so disrespectful.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I like the move for the Suns by the way.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: I mean, we were playing Isaiah Canaan at point, Mike James before we let him go (Lol), Tyler Ulis, Devin Booker (against his wishes). We literally just need someone who can get the ball across half-court and pass it to Devin.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Ah yes, Elfrid Payton, the difference between 24 wins and 26.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: He’s good!</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Yes, but see, the Suns are not. The Suns are a top-8 League Pass Alert squad, though.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: We’re in the Bagley/Bamba/Young sweepstakes. If we didn’t win a single game all season except those against the Lakers and Spurs, I’d be elated.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: I feel like the NBA has one more trade in it. Three minutes.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Nah, Woj is already outside smoking.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: </p>
<p>**Woj closes phone**</p>
<p>**throws it into a trashcan**</p>
<p>**lights trashcan on fire**</p>
<p>“Game, baby”</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: **Shams breaks DeAndre for Tristan**</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: The greatest rivalry in sports.</p>
<p>[3:00 PM]</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: It’s 3 p.m. Is that it? I think that’s it.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: Verdicts? I still can’t believe the Cavs managed to flip their entire roster in a half-hour.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: That was perhaps the greatest hour in NBA Twitter history.We were the real winners today.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: We were. I’m taking the rest of the day off to celebrate.</p>
<p>Ja’han Jones: Haha, this has been better than Emojigate.</p>
<p>Travis Waldron: That seems like a good place to end it.</p>
<p>Maxwell Strachan: Oh wait.</p>
<p>Now we’re done.</p>

<p>Google Translate can sometimes get scrambled, as the chefs for the Norwegian Winter Olympics team learned the hard way this week.</p>
<p>Needing some eggs to feed their athletes while in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the chefs told Norway’s Aftenposten newspaper that they’d turned to the online translation tool to help them draft an order for a local grocery store.</p>
<p>They’d intended to order 1,500 eggs, the chefs said, to make omelets, fried eggs and other dishes for their team of over 100 athletes. But when a whopping 15,000 eggs were delivered to their kitchen, they realized their translation had been in error.</p>
<p>“There was literally no end to the delivery. Absolutely unbelievable,” chef Ståle Johansen told Afterposten, according to an NBC News translation.</p>
<p>Johansen said they fortunately were able to return the extra 13,500 eggs to the store but said the chefs will still be whipping up plenty of egg dishes for the Norwegian competitors. He added that his culinary team will be preparing food “almost 24 hours a day” to keep their athletes well-nourished. </p>
<p>Norway has the highest all-time Winter Olympics medal count, with 329 medals amassed since the first Winter Games in 1924. The Scandinavian nation is expected to yet again be one of the top countries to beat at this year’s games. </p>
<p>Cooking for Olympic athletes is no small feat, as Megan Chacosky, a chef for the U.S. Winter Olympics team, explained to Mic.com in an interview last month. “I often joke that it’s like making Thanksgiving dinner twice a day,” said Chacosky, who will reportedly help prepare about 3,000 meals for the American team while it’s in Pyeonchang.</p>
<p>Chacosky told ABC News that most athletes at the Games, which kick off this Friday, will be consuming 3,000 to 4,000 calories per day.</p>
<p>“The amount of travel these athletes do, in addition to their training, they’re putting their bodies to the max,” she said. “We try to get lots of fresh produce to get vitamins and minerals to help keep them healthy.”</p>

<p>It’s Mario time for one American athlete competing at Pyeongchang 2018.</p>
<p>Twitter user @douglasturtle on Wednesday joked that Olympic curler Matt Hamilton bears a resemblance to Nintendo’s famed animated Italian plumber video game character, Mario:</p>
<p>The U.S. Olympic Committee’s official @TeamUSA Twitter account joined in with the fun, lightheartedly asking its 1.9 million followers to “spot the difference” between these two pictures:</p>
<p>Which is exactly what some people did:</p>
<p>Hamilton also retweeted the committee’s post, which suggests he was down with the comparison.</p>
<p>The gentle ribbing doesn’t appear to have put Hamilton, 28, off his game. He’s representing America in the mixed doubles curling competition alongside his sister, Becca Hamilton, 27.</p>
<p>The siblings, from McFarland, Wisconsin, beat married Russian couple Anastasia Bryzgalova and Alexander Krushelnitskiy in their first preliminary match on Thursday.</p>
<p>The games formally open on Friday.</p>

<p>Growing up, siblings Matt and Becca Hamilton ate meals together, played outdoors together, celebrated holidays together ...</p>
<p>Now, they’re sharing an Olympic dream together.</p>
<p>The Hamiltons, of McFarland, Wisconsin, will be going for the gold as the U.S. mixed doubles Olympic curling team.</p>
<p>Mixed doubles curling is one of four new events being introduced at the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, according to Reuters. </p>
<p>Matt, 28, and Becca, 27, will also compete separately for the U.S. women’s and men’s teams.</p>
<p>Although the U.S. curling team is only ranked eighth in the world, Matt Hamilton believes he and his sis have a good chance in their opening match on Thursday against fourth-ranked Russia.</p>
<p>They face off against married curlers Anastasia Bryzgalova and Alexander Krushelnitskiy, but Matt suggests the connection he has with Becca is stronger than the bond between their competitors.</p>
<p>“I can’t divorce my sister,” he told Reuters. </p>
<p>Matt started curling 16 years ago, and Becca took up the sport two years later.</p>
<p>“He brought me into the game, so I guess what better partner can I find than someone that brought me up?” she told Inside Edition.</p>
<p>“She couldn’t find a better partner,” Matt quipped.</p>
<p>“I probably could,” his sister shot back.</p>
<p>Snappy patter like that may help the Hamiltons catch the attention of American TV viewers typically more interested in figure skating or ski jumping.</p>
<p>Matt describes the sport ― in which people push a 44-pound “stone” across the ice with a “broom” ― as a mix of shuffleboard, chess and bowling. “Oh, and Swiffering your floor,” he told Inside Edition.</p>
<p>Curling is the longest Winter Olympic contest: The first match starts before Friday’s opening ceremonies and the last game ends just hours before the Olympic torch is extinguished.</p>
<p>That means the Hamiltons will be spending a lot of time together in South Korea, which suits Becca just fine.</p>
<p>“I think it’s kind of come full circle now that Matt kind of got me into curling and has taught me a lot of things along the way,” she told NBC Sports. “So to be doing it at this level is a pretty surreal experience.”</p>

<p>The Eaton County, Michigan, sheriff’s office announced on Tuesday that John Geddert, the former U.S. women’s gymnastics Olympic coach who worked closely with former team doctor and convicted pedophile Larry Nassar, is facing a criminal investigation. </p>
<p>The Lansing State Journal reported on Tuesday that the sheriff’s office said “there are new people coming forward” with complaints against the former U.S. Olympic coach. The department said it could not comment about the details of the complaints as the investigation was ongoing. </p>
<p>Neither Geddert nor USA Gymnastics immediately responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.</p>
<p>Geddert was the head coach for the women’s gymnastics team during the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 London Olympics. He owned two training centers where Nassar worked and was reportedly very close with the disgraced physician, who has been accused by over 265 women of serial sexual abuse under the guise of medical treatment. Nassar repeatedly molested many young girls at Geddert’s training center Twistars. </p>
<p>USA Gymnastics suspended Geddert in January amid Nassar’s highly publicized sentencing hearings. A few hours later, Geddert announced his retirement. </p>
<p>Nassar will spend the rest of his life in prison after pleading guilty to 10 counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. Additionally, he is serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges.</p>
<p>During Nassar’s sentencing hearings, dozens of survivors accused Geddert of being physically and verbally abusive, with some saying he must have known about Nassar’s abuse. </p>
<p>“My mother once told me ‘If a boyfriend ever treats you the way John does, leave him,’” survivor Annie Labrie said during her victim impact statement. </p>
<p>At least one athlete said in her victim impact statement that Geddert walked into the room while Nassar was molesting her.</p>
<p> Geddert and Nassar first began working together at the Great Lakes Gymnastics Club. Later, in 1996, Geddert brought Nassar on to work at the gym he currently owns, Twistars USA Gymnastics Club.  </p>
<p> Geddert was competitive and was borderline abusive, verbally and physically, to gymnasts, according to Outside the Lines.  </p>
<p> “John’s very good at emotional manipulation. He can make you feel like nothing very quickly,” former office manager at Twistars, Priscilla Kintigh, told Outside the Lines. “Larry was the one to calm the girls down when they had a practice with John.”  Geddert is one of dozens of adults who surrounded Nassar for over two decades while the team doctor molested young athletes. Several officials at USA Gymnastics, Michigan State University and the U.S. Olympic Committee have resigned in the face of harsh criticism. MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon resigned in late January. The entire USA Gymnastics board resigned and the NCAA opened an investigation into how MSU handled the Nassar case.  In January, Congress passed a bill that aims to protect young athletes from sexual abuse and regulate governing bodies of amateur sports.  </p>

<p>Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier soaked in applause Tuesday night for perhaps the best NFL comeback of the season.</p>
<p>Shazier, who could not move his legs after a head-on tackle in early December during a game shown on “Monday Night Football,” stood up with assistance at a Penguins’ NHL game in Pittsburgh. He acknowledged the crowd with a raised No. 1 finger and a pat on his chest.</p>
<p>His prognosis appeared bleak after the injury and surgery, which resulted from this hit: </p>
<p>But last week, Shazier posted a photo showing him standing as he announced his release from the hospital. On Sunday, he confirmed a report from sports journalist Michele Tafoya that he was on an assisted-walking program, and said it “remains a struggle.”</p>
<p>Even so, quite a comeback.</p>

<p>New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski just suffered another loss.</p>
<p>Gronkowski returned Monday from his team’s Super Bowl defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles to find that his Foxborough, Massachusetts, home had been burglarized.</p>
<p>Foxborough Police Chef William D. Baker told the Boston Globe that the football star had been hit with a “double whammy.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you ever been the victim of a break-in, but when you are robbed and there is an intrusion into your personal space, it’s unpleasant whether you are Rob Gronkowski or Bill Baker,’’ Baker said. “For him, it’s a double whammy coming off the loss.”</p>
<p>Police wouldn’t reveal details of the crime.</p>
<p>“We are not releasing any information on the property stolen or possible suspects at this time to preserve the integrity of the criminal investigation,” Baker told HuffPost in an email Tuesday.</p>
<p>A recording of the police radio call at Broadcastify.com noted “multiple safes and possible guns taken,” The Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>Gronkowski, 28, made nine catches for 116 yards and two touchdowns in Sunday’s Super Bowl, and later grabbed headlines for not dismissing a report that he was pondering retirement.</p>

<p> The Winter Olympics in Pyeonchang, South Korea, are already stomach-churning ― and the competition hasn’t even started yet. The host country has called in the troops after pulling 1,200 civilian security guards from duty amid a norovirus outbreak, according to outlets. Lee Hee-beom, chairman of the Pyeongchang Olympics organizing committee, said Tuesday that the civilian guards will be sequestered until it is determined that they are “well,” CBS News reported. Dozens of guards were already hospitalized Sunday for sudden vomiting and diarrhea. “The military personnel ... will be responsible for security checks of the 20 venues as they take up jobs such as security searches, previously done by civilian safety personnel, until the patients’ condition is normalized,” a statement Monday from the Olympics committee said, per CNN. The infected guards were in stable condition, the statement said, and all Olympic living quarters and buses were being sterilized. </p>
<p>The 41 security guards diagnosed with the easily transmitted virus were staying in the same building, the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said Monday.</p>
<p> “KCDC dispatched an immediate response team to the Pyeongchang site to check additional people for symptoms, check the origin of the exposure, take measures to control infection and prevent spread,” the statement sent to media said. As of Tuesday morning, officials still had not determined the origin of the norovirus. But, CBS noted, they are focusing their investigation on food and water sources at the facility where the guards resided. They are also inspecting other facilities that rely on groundwater. According to the CDC, you can contract norovirus by drinking contaminated liquids, touching contaminated surfaces and putting fingers in your mouth, or having contact with someone who is infected ― for example, sharing a fork. Competition begins Wednesday and the opening ceremony is Friday. </p>

<p>The Philadelphia Eagles will celebrate their first-ever Super Bowl win at home with a championship parade on Thursday, and the city’s public school system wants to make sure students and teachers get to experience the magic. </p>
<p>In a tweet sent Monday afternoon, the School District of Philadelphia said that all schools and administrative offices will be closed on Thursday for the festivities. </p>
<p>“The excitement of the Eagles first Super Bowl victory is a once in a lifetime event,” the message read. “For this reason, we have decided to give our students, teachers & their families the chance to witness history.”</p>
<p>Superintendent William Hite followed up the tweet with his own note stressing the importance of attending school every other day while encouraging students to enjoy the parade.</p>
<p>After the Eagles flew to victory Sunday night against the New England Patriots, rowdy fans took to the streets of Philadelphia to party. There were reports of small fires and at least one overturned car, and the mayor said three arrests had been made as of Monday morning.</p>
<p>Several Eagles players have already indicated that they would not accept a still-hypothetical invitation from President Donald Trump to mark their win at the White House. </p>
<p>But all players should be present as the team brings home the Vince Lombardi Trophy to Philly for the first time.</p>

<p>Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson and another man were struck and killed on the side of an Indiana interstate highway early Sunday by a suspected drunk driver, police said.</p>
<p>Jackson, 26, had been traveling on Interstate 70 in an Uber about 4 a.m. when he suddenly felt “ill,” Indiana State Police said. His driver, Jeffrey Monroe, 54, pulled onto the shoulder and stopped, and both men stepped out, investigators said.</p>
<p>A pickup driven by Alex Cabrera Gonsales, 37, swerved onto the shoulder and plowed into both men, killing both, police said. Gonsales tried to flee the crash on foot, but didn’t get far before police captured him.</p>
<p>Police said they suspect Gonsales was intoxicated and was driving without a license.</p>
<p>The Colts shared the news of Jackson’s death on social media, saying the team would “miss him greatly.”</p>
<p>Several of Jackson’s current and former teammates also shared words of grief and shock on their personal Twitter pages.</p>
<p>Jackson, originally from Atlanta, was signed to the Colts’ practice squad in 2015 and began appearing in games in 2016. According to the IndyStar, Jackson played in all 16 games that season. He missed the 2017 season due to an injury, and had been hoping to make a comeback in 2018.</p>

<p>MINNEAPOLIS — Doug Pederson, who was coaching in high school less than a decade ago, out-coached New England Patriots legend Bill Belichick in a Super Bowl. With his backup quarterback. Let that sink in.</p>
<p>There will be many enduring moments from the Philadelphia Eagles’ 41-33 win in Super Bowl LII, but nothing will top Pederson going for it on fourth-and-goal at the 1-yard line and having the fortitude to call a trick play with a tight end passing to his quarterback.</p>
<p>“You really want to know what we call it?” Pederson said when asked about the trick play. “‘Philly Special.’”</p>
<p>“Philly Special” was actually borrowed from elsewhere. It seems to have its roots at Clemson, who ran it for a two-point conversion from DeAndre Hopkins to Tajh Boyd in 2012. Quarterback Nick Foles approached the line like he was going to call an audible. There was a direct snap to running back Corey Clement, who started right and pitched to tight end Trey Burton. Burton threw to Foles for a touchdown.</p>
<p>“We’re all sitting there on fourth down, wondering what’s going to come in, if we’re going to kick a field goal,” center Jason Kelce said. “Then we get the play in, and I can’t tell you how excited everybody in the huddle was to run that. We all felt like it was perfect.”</p>
<p>It’s one thing to run that on a random Saturday afternoon against Georgia Tech. It’s another thing to call it on fourth down with more than 100 million people watching.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what, for a coach to call that play in that situation — are you kidding me?” offensive coordinator Frank Reich said.</p>
<p>“That’s been Doug Pederson all year. He’s stayed confident in this group of guys,” Kelce said.</p>
<p>Pederson said he thought his team needed touchdowns, and not short field goals, to beat the Patriots. And that should be obvious to everyone. But you don’t see that line of thinking often in a league overrun by risk-averse coaches who would rather kick 19-yard field goals and avoid criticism if going for it doesn’t work out.</p>
<p>Pederson’s devil-may-care ways at the Super Bowl didn’t surprise any of the Eagles. Pederson put his foot on the gas when the season started and never let up. The Eagles led the NFL in fourth-down conversions. After Carson Wentz went down with an injury the Eagles didn’t go in a shell; they devised aggressive game plans specifically catered for Foles. When Pederson met with the team before the Super Bowl, he had a simple message: He wasn’t going to change anything about his approach just because of the magnitude of the game or who they were facing.</p>
<p>“He said he was going to be aggressive, that was his message pregame,” Ertz said. “He said if we were up, he was still going to be aggressive.”</p>
<p>Pederson stayed true to that. Some analysts figured there might be a run-heavy game plan to hide Foles. Foles threw 43 times for 373 yards, and consistently threw downfield. There are only a few coaches in the NFL bold enough to go for it on fourth-and-1 at their own 45 with less than six minutes left in a regular-season game, much less a Super Bowl. Pederson went for it, Zach Ertz caught a 2-yard pass. The Eagles scored the game-winning touchdown later in the drive.</p>
<p>“We knew coach was going to go for it,” receiver Alshon Jeffery said. “That’s what he’s been doing all year.”</p>
<p>Pederson will get credit for going for it on the fourth downs, and coaching up Foles to throw for more than 700 yards in the NFC championship game and Super Bowl. His mastery Sunday was also in the little things that weren’t as obvious. As Ertz explained his game-winning touchdown, he said the Patriots double-teamed him on similar plays earlier in the game. This time, the Eagles sent the running back in motion away from Ertz. Once a Patriots defender went with the back in motion, Foles and Ertz knew it was man coverage and Ertz was one-on-one. Foles hit his tight end on a slant route for the score. That’s not as splashy as “Philly Special,” but it’s another example of how Pederson and his staff out-coached the Patriots.</p>
<p>“They kept us off balance,” Belichick said.</p>
<p>And on the other sideline, cornerback Malcolm Butler stayed on the bench for vague reasons while Butler’s backup Eric Rowe got picked on. It wasn’t Belichick’s best night, while Pederson pushed every correct button.</p>
<p>“Our coach, Doug Pederson, should have won coach of the year,” Ertz said to a question that had nothing to do with Pederson. “He’s the best play-caller I’ve ever played with, the best coach I’ve ever played for.”</p>
<p>After Sunday, Pederson will be mentioned alongside the NFL’s best coaches. The Super Bowl win was a long way from his four seasons at Calvary Baptist Academy from 2005-08, when he was figuring out if he really wanted to coach. It’s even a long way from the beginning of this season, when he was still a mystery and one well-known analyst opined that Pederson was “less qualified to coach a team than anyone I’ve ever seen.” On Sunday, at the end of just his second season as a head coach, his creative and aggressive game plan got the best of Belichick, who will probably go down as the greatest coach ever. Pederson brought a Super Bowl title to Philadelphia, and it seems like he’s just getting started.</p>
<p>“I just come to work, the same person, and I don’t want to change,” Pederson said. “Hopefully we can win a couple more of these.”</p>

<p>MINNEAPOLIS – Surrounded by cameras and a sudden bandwagon of well-wishers, Nick Foles tried to bulldoze his way up the U.S. Bank tunnel. He clutched the hand of his wife Tori, who herself held their daughter Lily. The world suddenly wanted a word with Nick Foles, the discarded, unheralded, former backup Eagles quarterback who had just outdueled Tom Brady to lead Philadelphia to a 41-33 Super Bowl win.</p>
<p>It was all coming fast now, after always coming slow for the Foles family. For so long, it was just them, scraping and questioning and, in the end, believing. Believing in Nick. Believing in themselves and in their faith and in the idea that, sure, this outlandish, outrageous night out of their wildest dreams was possible.</p>
<p>An NFL employee tried to help them through the throng by promising there’d be plenty of time to talk with the Philadelphia quarterback.</p>
<p>“Nick Foles,” it was shouted, “is going to the MVP room.”</p>
<p>With that, Nick and Tori shot each other a look and a smile. It’s reasonable to assume Nick Foles didn’t know there was such a thing as a Super Bowl MVP interview room, let alone that such a sentence would ever be declared. Yet there were the Foles, Nick and Tori, a mostly anonymous couple out of the University of Arizona, marching right onto turf more familiar with Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen.</p>
<p>Two years ago Foles was ready to retire from football at age 26, frustrated with his situation, lacking in his motivation, uncertain either would ever improve.</p>
<p>Sunday, he outdueled Brady in one of the wildest Super Bowls ever. He threw for 373 yards and three touchdowns. He added a 1-yard touchdown reception on an all-timer of a trick play. Mostly though, he played with the poise and focus that belied the fact that until franchise quarterback Carson Wentz was injured in December, Foles was nothing but a backup, a journeyman, another name in the NFL’s parade of mediocre QBs.</p>
<p>When Wentz got hurt though, in came Foles. When the Eagles got here and found themselves in a shootout with Brady, who would chuck it for a record 505 yards and three touchdowns of his own, Foles never blinked.</p>
<p>“The stage is never too big for him,” said tight end Zach Ertz, who caught the game-deciding touchdown pass.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have to be Superman,” Foles said. “I have amazing teammates.”</p>
<p>He was Superman though. And that was the thing. The Eagles didn’t win because of a superior defense and a mistake-free day by a game manager of a quarterback. Brady was slashing the defense apart. They needed someone to do the same. They needed someone to be better than Brady.</p>
<p>So there was Foles, moving the Eagles up and down the field to the tune of 538 total yards. There was Foles, throwing brilliant passes – a 34-yard touchdown to Alshon Jeffrey, a 22-yard bullet to Corey Clement.</p>
<p>There was Foles, leading an offense that went 10-of-16 on third down, and 2-of-2 on fourth, including a conversion on the game-winning drive. There was Foles, running a fake-audible-turned-Wildcat-reverse pass back to Foles for a touchdown.</p>
<p>There was Foles, providing the battered and gasping defense with enough hope to know it needed to make just one play, one stop and the Super Bowl could be Philly’s. It came with 2:16 remaining, a strip sack of Brady after the Patriots hadn’t punted or turned it over all night.</p>
<p>It wasn’t much. With Nick Foles at the helm, it was enough.</p>
<p>And so there was Nick Foles, in the “MVP room”, waiting for a chance to speak to the media.</p>
<p>First he took a seat next to Tori and held Lily on his lap. The baby wore a green Eagles scarf across her head and pink, noise-cancelling head phones over her ears. He pulled a silver chain out from underneath his jersey and she began played with the cross at the end of it.</p>
<p>He was still wearing his uniform and his baseball cap said the Eagles had won the Super Bowl. Other than that, he looked as calm as ever, just a dad and his family.</p>
<p>Which was, he said, how this all worked in the first place.</p>
<p>“That’s what life’s about right there,” Foles said. “We’re Super Bowl champs, but time does stop when you look in your daughter’s eyes and you get to celebrate this moment. I got to look in my wife’s eyes. I get to celebrate this with her. They’ve been there. My wife’s been there through everything. My family has been through everything.</p>
<p>“I’m just grateful.”</p>
<p>Foles grew up in Texas and originally attended Michigan State before transferring to Arizona, in part to find playing time. There he met Tori, a volleyball player for the Wildcats. He was a third-round pick, and despite a Pro Bowl season in 2013 in Philadelphia, he was never anyone’s idea of a sure-fire star. Injuries held him to just eight games in 2014. He wound up on a bad St. Louis Rams team in 2015.</p>
<p>That’s when he was ready to quit. Football had been fun. It was never going to be like he dreamt it though.</p>
<p>Instead he went fishing, prayed a lot and leaned on his family. He decided to give it another shot. A year in Kansas City restored his enthusiasm, but did little for his career. Returning to Philly this year, he was second-string, an insurance policy that few thought could cash in like this.</p>
<p>All along though, he continued to believe and make others around him believe.</p>
<p>“He’s just the real deal,” said Dan Moore, his father-in-law. “He’s just a great person and even when he was ready to retire, I always believed he had the talent to be a star in this league, physically and mentally.”</p>
<p>He just needed his chance. Foles credits his faith for offering calm and perspective. Maybe he wasn’t having a career like Brady. He was still in the NFL, still chasing something, still surrounded by that family of his.</p>
<p>This game was a microcosm of his career. Little expected, except by him. Overlooked when compared to the other guy. Nothing to lean on but himself, his faith and those around him.</p>
<p>When you’re blessed with that, Foles said, a fourth-quarter drive when trailing the vaunted Patriots is nothing.</p>
<p>“I was really staying in the moment,” Foles said. “Just staying in the moment.”</p>
<p>Off to the side Tori smiled and Lily sat quietly. It all seemed so normal, a pack of media asking about this pass or that play, about besting Tom Brady, about winning the Super Bowl. If the rest of the world was surprised, they didn’t appear to be.</p>
<p>Nick Foles was in the MVP room. Of course, he was.</p>

<p>Have we seen the last of Gronk?</p>
<p>Reporters peppered a subdued Rob Gronkowski with questions about retirement after his New England Patriots lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl Sunday night. And he didn’t do much to shoot down the speculation.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old tight end had been under the NFL’s concussion protocol until Thursday. He caught nine Tom Brady passes for 116 yards and 2 touchdowns in Sunday’s 41-33 defeat.</p>
<p>Asked at a postgame press conference to confirm a report that he was “potentially retiring,” Gronkowski replied in the segment above: “I don’t know how you heard that but I mean I’m definitely going to look at my future, for sure. I’m going to sit down the next couple of weeks and see where I’m at.”</p>
<p>Pressed further about what would push him to retire, he said: “I’m not ready for these types of questions right now. I’m just going to sit down, reflect on the season, talk to my teammates.”</p>
<p>In a brilliant but injury-riddled career, Gronkowski has broken his left forearm twice, fractured his vertebra and torn the ACL and MCL in his right knee. He has also suffered a host of less serious problems for which he missed games.</p>
<p>But if he indeed is going to hang it up, it sounds like he’s going to give it more thought.</p>
<p>“We just lost,” he said. “I just wanna just sit back, relax the next couple of weeks. I really, really got nothing to say about that right now.”</p>

<p>MINNEAPOLIS – When it was over and Tom Brady had logged the greatest passing performance in Super Bowl history, his last emotional completion came on one knee. Moving through deafening silence just minutes after a 41-33 defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles, one of the toughest and most prolific losses of his career, the New England Patriots quarterback stepped behind a black curtain and dropped down as his wife and kids closed around him.</p>
<p>“Group hug,” Gisele Bundchen said.</p>
<p>Brady buried his face in Bundchen’s shoulder for a moment, then turned and whispered to one of his crying children.</p>
<p>“Hey buddy, it’s OK. We did our best and tried our hardest,” Brady said. “It will be OK. Now I get to pick you up and take you to school every day.”</p>
<p>For the GOAT, it was a rare and vulnerable moment in Super Bowl defeat, when there is hollow solace in having put on one of the greatest offensive shows in the history of the NFL’s biggest stage. But in the final equation, Sunday night meant little more than frustrating failure. After one of the more trying seasons of his career, the ultimate payoff had eluded him. And it did so in the cruelest fashion: beginning with the ball in his hands, in the waning moments that have come to define his career; but essentially ending with a sack and fumble that scuttled a potential game-winning drive.</p>
<p>“Losing sucks,” Brady said afterward. “That’s part of it.”</p>
<p>This is how Brady and the Patriots will be remembered after this one – with the Eagles hoisting the Lombardi Trophy; with Nick Foles at the MVP podium; and with significant change ahead for the franchise. Two coordinators will depart in the coming days. Roster changes appear inevitable, including the departure of once-beloved cornerback Malcolm Butler, who was benched by the coaching staff Sunday. And maybe even a little contemplation from Brady himself, who fought off questions Sunday night about another black curtain that is naturally and methodically drawing nearer.</p>
<p>“I expect to be back, so we’ll see,” Brady said. “I mean, it’s 15 minutes after the game ended, so I would like to process this a little bit. I wouldn’t see why I wouldn’t be back.”</p>
<p>From a performance standpoint, there’s little question of whether Brady can return and lead the Patriots after an offseason of retooling. He smashed his own Super Bowl record with 505 passing yards, meticulously dicing up an Eagles defense that repeatedly knocked him around. In arguably any other Patriots season, coming back from a 22-12 halftime deficit to a 33-32 lead deep into the fourth quarter would have resulted in a win. But this wasn’t like most other seasons. Instead, a Patriots defense that rebounded from a horrendous start in the regular season finished with a bookend of failure, allowing the Eagles to roll up 538 yards on offense.</p>
<p>If the punishment Brady took on offense doesn’t leave him with something to think about this offseason, parts of a mini rebuild should. Not only did tight end Rob Gronkowski say he’s going to contemplate his future in football this offseason, but the Patriots seem to have given up on Butler, who didn’t play a single defensive snap in a stunning coaching decision.</p>
<p>There’s also the overall performance of the defense, which was more overmatched against the Eagles than any other Patriots Super Bowl team. All of this has to be a bitter pill for Brady, who has consistently played with one of the most undervalued contracts in NFL history. In offseasons where football mortality is contemplated even more, it’s no small thing surrendering maximum earning capacity in a way that allows the Patriots to invest in the defense.</p>

<p>MINNEAPOLIS – In the wildest shootout in Super Bowl history, unheralded Nick Foles outdueled legendary Tom Brady to lead the Philadelphia Eagles to a Super Bowl title, defeating the New England Patriots, 41-33.</p>
<p>Foles went 28 for 43 for 373 yards and three touchdowns, including leading a come-from-behind, game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter. A back-up most of the season to Carson Wentz, Foles was particularly brilliant when it mattered the most, on third and fourth downs in clutch situations. He even caught a touchdown pass at the end of the first half.</p>
<p>New England somehow lost despite never punting or turning the ball over. Brady, seeking his sixth championship, broke his own Super Bowl record for most passing yards with 505. He went 28-for-48 and tossed XX touchdowns.</p>
<p>Brady was brilliant.</p>
<p>It was Foles who was the champion and Super Bowl MVP though.</p>
<p>Trailing for the first time in the game, 33-32 with 9:26, Foles led the Philly offense on a legendary game-winning drive. It included converting twice on third down and once on fourth down, often by the smallest of margins. It ended with a six-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Zach Ertz, who leapt across the goal line.</p>
<p>Ertz lost the ball on contact with the field just after he crossed the goalline. Replay ruled it a catch, determining he had made a football move and became a runner therefore the play was dead when the ball crossed the plane of the end zone.</p>
<p>In the third quarter, Foles hit running back Corey Clement on a 22-yard dime into double coverage. The running back initially controlled the ball, bobbled it a bit and then appeared to fail to get both feet in the end zone. Initially ruled a touchdown, it was upheld on a controversial replay review and brought one of the NFL’s most tired storylines – what’s a catch – to the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>After the Ertz score gave Philly the lead, Brady got the ball back with 2:21 remaining in the game, spurring thoughts of another dramatic Patriots comeback.</p>
<p>Not this time, though. The Eagles defense stepped up when Brandon Graham strip-sacked Brady, causing a fumble that was recovered by the Eagles. Philly kicked a field goal to extend the lead to eight.</p>
<p>With 1:05 remaining, Brady then attempted to drive New England again for a touchdown and two-point conversion but couldn’t do it.</p>
<p>It was the first sign of life by the Philly defense. New England, to that point, had neither punted, had a turnover or allowed a sack.</p>
<p>That’s the Eagles though, opportunistic, confident and more than capable of standing up to the NFL’s biggest bully and punching back.</p>
<p>The game was an offensive classic, setting multiple Super Bowl records, including most yards gained before the start of the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The Eagles led 22-12 after a wild, entertaining first half that saw a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>There was 683 total yards. A brilliant 37-yard Foles-to-Jeffrey touchdown pass. A 46-yard Rex Burkhead catch and rumble.</p>
<p>Tom Brady dropping a pass from Danny Amendola that hit him directly in the hands. Foles catching one for a touchdown on a daring fake-audible, wildcat snap, reverse, throw-back to the QB.</p>
<p>Each team missed an extra point. Philly failed on a two-point conversion. New England had a bad snap cost them a field goal. Patriots receiver Brandin Cooks was knocked out of the game on a violent hit.</p>
<p>There were gadget plays and huge gains galore.</p>
<p>Corey Clement had a 53 yard catch and run for the Eagles. LeGarrette Blount rumbled for 36 and added a touchdown. New England saw Danny Amendola haul one in for 50 and Chris Hogan for 43. James White scored on a 26-yard run.</p>
<p>The pregame festivities were mostly eventless. All players stood for the national anthem, as they have for the entire playoffs in a movement that had mostly faded away this season until it was rekindled by president Donald Trump in week three.</p>
<p>Pink sang it well after taking out a throat lozenge just before performing.</p>
<p>At halftime, Justin Timberlake performed a number of hit songs, including singing Purple Rain as the image of Prince, a beloved native of Minnesota who passed away last year, was projected onto a giant curtain inside U.S. Bank Stadium.</p>

<p>MINNEAPOLIS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Moments after a stunning Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, New England Patriots’ 40-year-old quarterback Tom Brady was not ready to retire, saying he would likely return and try again for his sixth National Football League title.</p>
<p>Brady, the face of the NFL with his five previous Super Bowl victories, suffered his third defeat in the championship game, losing the ball on a strip sack at a crucial time in the Philadelphia Eagles’ 41-33 victory.</p>
<p>“I expect to be back,” Brady said. “It’s 15 minutes after the game ended, so I would like to process this. I don’t see why I wouldn’t be back.”</p>
<p>The strip-sack play with a little over two minutes left and his team down five points overshadowed his Super Bowl record 505 yards passing. He completed 28 of 48 passes with three touchdowns and no turnovers, moving the ball so well that the Patriots never punted.</p>
<p>For all his success, though, two failed plays will stand out in Sunday’s loss.</p>
<p>On the strip sack, he dropped back to pass and came under pressure, with Philadelphia linebacker Brandon Graham knocking the ball loose and Philadelphia’s Derek Barnett recovering and advancing the ball to the Patriots’s 31-yard line.</p>
<p>That led to an Eagles field goal and an eight-point lead that held for the rest of the game.</p>
<p>“Those guys had a good rush and got it there and made a good play,” Brady said. “They made a good play at the right time.”</p>
<p>In another rare flop, he went out as a receiver on a trick play on third down in the second quarter but could not haul in the pass from receiver Danny Amendola, which was just beyond his reach.</p>
<p>Brady handed off to running back James White, who pitched it to Amendola on what appeared to be a reverse while Brady sneaked out into the flat, wide open. A catch would have resulted in a first down. Instead, it bounced off his outstretched hands.</p>
<p>“Danny made a good throw. I just didn’t make the play,” Brady said.</p>
<p>Asked if he caught the pass in practice, he said: “Yeah, I caught it. Didn’t catch it tonight.”</p>
<p>Dominant as the Patriots have been since Brady’s first championship after the 2001 season, he said: “No one is going to feel sorry for us.”</p>
<p>Nor will they feel sorry for Brady, who is revered in New England and in 2009 married Brazilian-born model Gisele Bundchen, the mother of their two children.</p>
<p>Brady has attributed his longevity in part to a strict diet of largely organic, plant-based foods, avoiding those he says contribute to muscle inflammation, while drinking 12 to 25 glasses of water per day, including 20 ounces (60 cl) fortified with electrolytes first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>He says he goes to sleep at 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p>For now, he will have the off-season to contemplate how the Patriots will return to football’s center stage.</p>
<p>“We’ll evaluate like we always do,” he said. “I’m pretty sure everyone is tired after a long year.”</p>

<p>The Super Bowl is one of the greatest visual spectacles on Earth, but at least one young kid at the game appeared to have found something more interesting on his phone, in the process creating the greatest meme of the day.</p>
<p>Justin Timberlake’s halftime performance grabbed headlines even before it started ― with speculations about whether he would address the 2004 ‘nipplegate’ controversy with Janet Jackson, if Jackson herself would make an appearance, and even rumors about a Prince hologram. As Timberlake ran through a medley of hits on the field, a large crowd of fans gathered around.</p>
<p>One of them was a 13-year-old from Massachusetts, identified as Ryan McKenna.</p>
<p>Timberlake singled the kid out in the middle of the crowd, snapping a quick selfie with him and then getting back to his performance. With the cameras firmly on him, hundreds of millions of people around the world looking directly at his face, McKenna did exactly what most people would do in an awkward situation: look deeply into their phone.</p>
<p>As other fans danced, sang and generally lost their minds, viewers at home saw McKenna grab his phone ― and inspire a stack of jokes. </p>
<p>People on social media couldn’t stop joking about what the kid was looking at that was so much more important than what he was doing, in the middle of the field, during the halftime show, at the Super Bowl. </p>
<p>Some people criticized the kid for not living in the moment.</p>
<p>But look, the kid wanted his selfie with Timberlake ― and he got it! So we know who the real winner is here.</p>
<p>The Twin Cities Pioneer Press caught up with McKenna after the halftime show. He said he was recording a video of the performance and then, as Timberlake neared, he turned his phone around to switch modes and take a photo.</p>
<p>“It’s been so crazy,” McKenna told the Pioneer Press. “I don’t even know what to think. All my friends have been texting me and stuff. It’s insane.”</p>
<p>Ryan’s dad John McKenna told the Pioneer Press that his phone “started blowing up” following the TV broadcast of the moment.</p>
<p>“It died, like, instantly after it happened. We had friends from all over reaching out. I couldn’t believe it.” </p>

<p>Fans in Philadelphia promptly took to the streets on Sunday night after the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots, 41-33, for the team’s first Super Bowl championship.</p>
<p>Fans shot off fireworks, climbed poles ― despite the fact that many had been greased ― scaled buildings, marched, chanted and made a whole lot of noise. </p>
<p>But there were also reports of small fires and at least one overturned car, as well as smashed windows, damage to stores and poles being completely removed out of the ground. </p>
<p>Three people were arrested during the rowdy celebrations, a spokeswoman Mayor Jim Kenney’s office on Monday. </p>
<p>“Tens of thousands came out and celebrated this amazing victory last night, and but for a handful of bad actors the celebration was peaceful and jubilant,” according to the statement. “We’re thankful for our PPD for their assistance in getting the crowds dispersed and people home safely.”</p>
<p>Police have not yet released specific figures such as the number of injuries.</p>
<p>“We have had several acts of vandalism where windows have been smashed, and some injuries have been reported around light poles that have been pulled down,” the Philadelphia Police Department said in a statement to The New York Times. “We have one report of looting at a gas station. There have been no fatalities.”</p>
<p>Roughly a dozen Eagles fans scaled an awning attached to the Ritz Carlton hotel in downtown Philadelphia, causing the structure to collapse. It’s not clear if anyone was injured. </p>
<p>At least two phone poles were toppled and at least one person was seriously injured, CBS Philadelphia reported.</p>
<p>The city’s mayor urged fans to “celebrate safely.”</p>
<p>“We know you have waited years, some for decades, for the chance to crown your Birds as champs,” Kenney said in a statement Sunday. “I urge everyone to celebrate in a way that is safe and respectful to everyone from neighbors to strangers. Go forth and celebrate, but do so in a way that will make Philadelphia shine.”</p>

<p>Wide receiver Torrey Smith, defensive end Chris Long and safety Malcolm Jenkins have all said they won’t be going, NJ.com reported.</p>
<p>Jenkins said during an appearance Monday on CNN’s “New Day” that he does “not anticipate” attending the White House celebration. </p>
<p>“My message has been clear all year,” Jenkins said. “I’m about, you know, creating positive change in the communities that I come from, whether it be Philadelphia, New Jersey, Ohio, Louisiana or this entire country.</p>
<p>“I want to see changes in our criminal justice system,” he continued. “I want to see us push for ... [economic] and educational advancement in communities of color and low-income communities. And I want to see our relationships between our communities and our law enforcement be advanced.”</p>
<p>Several members of last year’s championship team, the New England Patriots, also refused to attend a White House ceremony in order to protest Trump’s policies. Since then, relations between the president and NFL players have only worsened.</p>
<p>In recent months, Trump has urged the league to fire or suspend players who took a knee during the national anthem in order protest racial inequality and police brutality.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he’s fired?’” Trump said during a speech in Alabama in September. </p>
<p>After Trump’s speech, more players began kneeling during the national anthem. He continued to slam their actions on Twitter and in speeches, and even raised the issue ― without mentioning the NFL specifically ― during his State of the Union address. </p>
<p>But players insist that they’re demonstrating to bring attention to important issues, not to disrespect the flag or the anthem. </p>
<p>“They call it the anthem protest,” Smith told NJ.com. “We’re not protesting the anthem. It’s a protest during the anthem. I understand why people are mad or may be offended when someone takes a knee.”</p>
<p>Long made his intentions clear in a podcast interview last week.</p>
<p>“No, I’m not going to the White House,” he told the “Pardon My Take” podcast. “Are you kidding me?”</p>
<p>Long was on the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots last season and was among several players who declined the White House visit. </p>
<p>“[When] my son grows up, and I believe the legacy of our president is going to be what it is, I don’t want him to say, ‘Hey Dad, why’d you go [to the White House] when you knew the right thing was to not go?’” Long said, according to the Washington Post. </p>
<p>Eagles running back LeGarrette Blount also skipped the visit last year when he was a member of the Patriots. Although he hasn’t announced his intentions this year, Blount expressed strong feelings last time around. </p>
<p>“I just don’t feel welcome into that house,” Blount said at the time. “I’m just gonna leave it at that.”</p>
<p>Last year Trump withdrew his White House invitation to the NBA champion Golden State Warriors after two-time MVP Steph Curry said he didn’t want to go. </p>

<p> Former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor Larry Nassar on Monday was sentenced to 40 to 125 years in prison for sexually abusing young athletes under the guise of medical treatment.  Nassar, 54, was sentenced in a Charlotte, Michigan, courtroom on three counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, adding to long prison terms he already faces for additional sex crimes. “I am not convinced that you truly understand that what you did was wrong and the devastating impact that you have had on the victims, their families and friends,” Judge Janice Cunningham told Nassar in court before handing down the punishment. “Clearly you are in denial. You don’t get it. And I do not believe that there is a likelihood that you could be reformed.” Nassar read a statement in court before he was sentenced.  “The words expressed by everyone that has spoken, including the parents, have impacted me to my inner-most core,” he said. “With that being said, I understand and acknowledge that it pales in comparison to the pain and trauma and emotions that you all feel. It’s impossible to convey the depth and breadth of how sorry I am to each and everyone involved.”  Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis, in her closing argument, reminded the judge how far-reaching Nassar’s abuse was.  “The breadth of the defendant’s abuse and destruction is nearly infinite,” the prosecutor said. ”... Few sports were saved from his predatory behavior, over a dozen different sports brought athletes to him who he abused.” Povilaitis also applauded the bravery of survivors who spoke against Nassar.  “We are taught to trust. We have to trust ... We are, above all, taught to trust doctors, especially those who appear to be world-class doctors,” she said. “I truly believe we’ve seen the worst humanity in the last few weeks and we’ve also seen the best.”  The disgraced former physician, who is accused of sexual abuse by more than 265 young women, pleaded guilty to the charges on Nov. 22. He is already serving 40 to 175 years in prison on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree, and an additional 60 years on child pornography charges.  The sentencing comes after more than 60 survivors delivered powerful victim impact statements in court to Nassar.  Former gymnast Tiffany Dutton said during the sentence hearing that she came forward with her story because of the “courage and bravery” of the other women who have already accused Nassar.  “It takes a monster to sexually assault a child,” she said. “But it takes a monster backed by ego, experience and power ― fueled by multiple institutions ― to sexually assault a child in front of their own mother.”  Among Nassar’s victims are Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney and Simone Biles. According to court documents, Nassar served as team doctor for USA Gymnastics, various MSU sports teams and at a local Michigan gym called Twistars. As such, he gained the trust of girls and their families, which gave him cover for exams during which he fondled and digitally penetrated the girls.  Larissa Boyce, the first woman to report Nassar’s abuse back in 1997, ended her impact statement on a powerful note.  “My sisters, they have risen up and they have spoken their truths,” Boyce said, referring to the hundreds of survivors. “Don’t forget. Don’t forget these truths. Don’t forget me. Don’t forget my story. Don’t forget the 265 ‘me toos.’ Don’t forget us.”     The hearing became violent on Friday morning when Randall Margraves, a father of three girls who were abused by Nassar, attacked the disgraced doctor in court.  “I would ask you to, as part of the sentencing, to grant me five minutes in a locked room with this demon. Would you do that? Would you give me one minute?” Margraves asked Cunningham before he lunged at Nassar.  Several officers escorted Margraves out of the courtroom in handcuffs, but Cunningham did not hold Margrave in contempt of court. The father later apologized, telling the judge: “I lost control and I apologize a hundred times... I’m not here to upstage my daughters, I’m here to help them heal.”   </p>
<p> In January, Nassar sat through a weeklong sentencing hearing where 169 survivors and family members read impact statements. Raisman, along with fellow Olympians Maroney and Jordyn Wieber, read statements.  “Larry, you do realize now that we ― this group of women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time ― are now a force and you are nothing,” Raisman said. “The tables have turned, Larry. We are here and we are not going anywhere.” Former gymnast Rachael Denollander was the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar in September 2016, a year before the #MeToo movement took off. USA Gymnastics then announced that they had previously relieved Nassar of his duties in 2015, and he was subsequently fired from his faculty position at MSU. He was arrested for possessing at least 37,000 images of child pornography in December 2016, and in July pleaded guilty to three federal counts relating to child pornography.     Although Nassar will spend the rest of his life behind bars, many are wondering if the institutions that employed him for so long will be held accountable. Dozens of survivors have called for an investigation into USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and MSU.  “I knew that he abused me. I reported it,” said survivor Amanda Thomashow in her statement during the earlier sentencing hearing. “Michigan State University had the audacity to tell me I did not understand the difference between sexual assault and a medical procedure.” The Detroit News reported that at least 14 MSU staffers and representatives were warned about Nassar’s abuse over the course of two decades, and failed to stop it.  Several officials at USA Gymnastics, MSU and the U.S. Olympic Committee have resigned in the face of harsh criticism. MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon resigned last week. The entire USA Gymnastics board resigned, and former Olympic coach John Geddert retired. The NCAA has also opened an investigation into how MSU handled the case.   At the end of January, Congress passed a bill that aims to protect young athletes and regulate governing bodies of amateur athletics.   “[This bill] goes across all amateur sports, not just gymnastics, not just swimming ― it’s all amateur sports to protect all kids,” Nassar survivor and former gymnast Jeanette Antolin said at a news conference about the bill. “Because all kids should be able to go and do sports without having to worry about adult predators.”       </p>

<p>It is a virtual certainty that when players from the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots line up on opposite sides of the field ahead of Sunday’s Super Bowl LII in Minneapolis, Minnesota, none of them will kneel, raise a fist or protest in any other fashion.</p>
<p>This is, in part, a product of circumstance: No Patriots player protested all season, and none of the teams that still had protesting players at the end of the NFL’s regular season managed to make the playoffs. It is, in another version of events, a sign of a victory won by the players on behalf of the issues of racial justice and oppression their protests had sought to highlight: The Eagles’ Malcolm Jenkins, who for much of the 2017 season raised his fist during the playing of the national anthem, agreed to halt his protests after striking a controversial deal with the NFL whereby the league will pour millions of dollars into various social and racial justice-oriented campaigns.</p>
<p>And yet, the protests that started with former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in 2016 will be notably missing from football’s main event, another entry in the history of black athletes’ protest and the freighted absences it creates.</p>
<p>This was, as HuffPost columnist Jamil Smith wrote this week, the “blackest year in NFL history” ― a season defined by Kaepernick’s lack of a contract and claims that he had been blackballed. A season defined by the continuation of the protests he began and by President Donald Trump’s repeated attacks on the “son of a bitch” players who spoke out against America’s racism and his own. A season defined by the NFL’s doddering responses that, at every turn, were geared more toward stopping the protests by any means necessary to appease the anxious white members of its audience than understanding the protests’ purpose or their significance.</p>
<p>This was the season the underlying dynamic of the sport, and of professional sports in general, was laid bare: Black men make up some three-quarters of the participants in a league that exploits their labor for the entertainment of largely white fans and the enrichment of mostly white owners. Which is why, when a black athlete removes himself from the normal proceedings of American sports, or when he is removed by force or by silent decree, a charged space forms. Kaepernick, Craig Hodges, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, the Wyoming Black 14 — the story of black agitation in sports is the story of profound absences.</p>
<p>And so, at Super Bowl LII, notwithstanding Monday night’s Black Lives Matter protest in St. Paul, the NFL’s blackest year will end with the absence of agitation itself.</p>
<p>The last time Minneapolis hosted a Super Bowl, in 1992, a series of protests against the Washington Redskins, who won that game, touched off the modern version of the movement against the team’s racist name. A lawsuit against the team’s trademark protections followed later that year; only this past fall did a second version of that suit fall at the hands of the Supreme Court. </p>
<p>The NFL and Washington’s owner have remained intransigent in the face of continued opposition to that name. The league has argued for more than two decades now that “Redskins” is not a “dictionary-defined racial slur,” as Native American groups say, but a symbol of “honor” and “respect” — waving away any suggestion that the stereotyping of Native Americans might exacerbate the inequalities and disparities they face in a country that for centuries has tried to eradicate them. </p>
<p>Perhaps, as Jenkins argued after his splintered Players Coalition reached its deal with the NFL, the league will be more forthcoming and less cynical in its efforts to help its black players address the problems they and their communities still face.</p>
<p>But there are reasons to share in the skepticism felt by players like 49ers safety Eric Reid, one of the first to join Kaepernick’s protest. Reid split with Jenkins and the Players Coalition over what he saw as a deal meant only to put a stop to the protests.</p>
<p>The NFL’s brass has long seen its league as separate from America’s problems, a bastion of unity that stands above the political and social issues that divide and define us. </p>
<p>Last year, ahead of Super Bowl LI in Houston ― home to millions of Latino immigrants and more refugees than any other city in our country ― reporters peppered NFL commissioner Roger Goodell with questions about Trump’s attempts to ban refugees from certain majority-Muslim countries. They asked about his plans to build a wall along the Mexican border. Goodell demurred, pointing back to the ideals of unity, pretending that the NFL is an inherently apolitical institution.</p>
<p>This is a lie, of course. The NFL owes its existence as a multibillion-dollar corporation to politics and political activism, and it is plenty willing to engage in the sort of politics that boost its bottom line: It stymies concussion research; it zealously pursues taxpayer funding for stadium construction; it lobbies for beneficial tax and antitrust treatment in Congress. And it continuously wraps itself in Americana, patriotism and militarism to pander to the white folks it sees as its primary fan base. </p>
<p>But these are the politics of self-preservation and self-enrichment, and they work best when paired with a furious backlash against any effort to change the status quo. The messages of the protesting players are distorted as somehow offensive to the military, or as a form of “reverse racism.” Athletes and sports commentators are ordered to “stick to sports.” Trump has harnessed the white backlash to the protests. Now others are, too: This week, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster (R) issued a proclamation calling on the state’s residents to stand during the anthem before the Super Bowl. </p>
<p>NFL owners ― many of whom financially supported Trump ― were eager adopters of the argument that the protests from Kaepernick, Jenkins and dozens of other players had turned off white fans. And so under the guise of Goodell’s oft-stated mantra of protecting “the shield” — a metonym alluding to the league’s heraldic symbol — they sought to end the protests in an effort to keep the show going and the dollars flowing. </p>
<p>So even if the league is genuine in its efforts to partner with the Players Coalition, it is surely thrilled that the demonstrations won’t continue Sunday night, that nothing will distract fans, or sponsors, or media, or anyone else from the spectacle at hand.</p>

<p>By Steve Keating</p>
<p>MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - The New England Patriots band will break up after the Super Bowl and they have every intention of going out on a high note when they take on the underdog Philadelphia Eagles in Sunday’s National Football League championship game.</p>
<p>Playing in their third Super Bowl in four years the Patriots success could be their dynasty’s demise with offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels and defensive mastermind Matt Patricia poised to move to the head coaching ranks soon after the Vince Lombardi trophy is hoisted.</p>
<p>The three pillars of the Patriots empire, quarterback Tom Brady, coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft, remain in place but even there cracks in the foundation have begun to appear with an ESPN report this month detailing dissension at the top of the New England ranks.</p>
<p>The Patriots, however, have rarely been distracted from their objective. Even the Deflategate scandal that swirled around the team in 2015 could not cause them to lose focus as they beat the Seattle Seahawks to be crowned champions.</p>
<p>“We prepare for all situations that we can going into a game,” Belichick told reporters. “We have a game plan, as the game unfolds then we’ll adjust as we go.</p>
<p>“Every game is different, every team’s different, every situation is a little bit different so we’ll just do what we normally do.”</p>
<p>Normally that means winning championships. </p>
<p>Brady and Belichick have teamed up to win five Super Bowls, including two in the last three years and another on Sunday would tie them with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most by any franchise.</p>
<p>Number six will once again hinge on the arm and play of their evergreen 40-year-old quarterback, who has faced as many questions about retirement during Super Bowl week as he has about the Eagles pass rush.</p>
<p>NO GOOD REASON</p>
<p>Statistically, there certainly would seem no good reason for Brady to hang up the cleats.</p>
<p>He led the NFL in passing yards this season with 4,577 while his 32 touchdown passes ranked third.</p>
<p>For those looking for a sign of decline there has been none.</p>
<p>He has his team back in the Super Bowl for the third time in four years and has had the type of season that has once again placed him in the most valuable player conversation.</p>
<p>Brady could be without his favorite target in tight end Rob Gronkowski, who remains under concussion protocol, but will have plenty of weapons at his disposal including Danny Amendola, who had two touchdown grab catches in their comeback win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC championship game.</p>
<p>The Patriots and Eagles have met once before in the Super Bowl, in 2005 when New England beat Philadelphia 24-21 and Brady will be the only player from either team on the field on Sunday who took part in that game.</p>
<p>Since then New England has been back to the Super Bowl four times, winning it twice. Philadelphia has been back once.</p>
<p>The Eagles have made it to their third Super Bowl despite losing number one quarterback Carson Wentz to a knee injury in Week 14 after leading his team to a 10-2 record.</p>
<p>The loss looked a devastating blow to the city’s hopes of celebrating a first Super Bowl title but back-up Nick Foles has stepped up, leading Philadelphia to playoff wins over the Atlanta Falcons and Minnesota Vikings. </p>
<p>The key to victory for Philadelphia will be the play of their defensive line, which is among the league’s best, and putting pressure on Brady.</p>
<p>The Eagles will give the Patriots the respect they have earned and deserve but will not be intimidated.</p>
<p>“All I can tell you is, we’re coming home with that trophy,” Philadelphia wide receiver Alshon Jeffery said.</p>

<p>A Spirit Airlines flight full of Philadelphia Eagles fans, heading from Los Angeles, Calif., to Philadelphia, Pa., appeared to be getting a bit rowdy Friday evening ahead of Sunday night’s Super Bowl. The flight attendant took to the loud speaker to tell the passengers to “tone it down a little bit.” </p>
<p>“I know you’re excited,” he continued in a video posted to Twitter by one passenger.</p>
<p>Eagles fans booed the crew’s instructions and instead broke out into the team’s fight song, singing “Fly, Eagles, fly, on the way to victory!”</p>
<p>Among those passengers was Eagles fan Tony Hermosillo of Lawndale California (responsible for the above video), who traveled to Philadelphia to watch the big game with the home team fans. </p>
<p>“The mood was amazing,” Hermosillo told CNN. “Everyone was friendly and excited.” </p>
<p>The Philadelphia Eagles face off against the New England Patriots Sunday at 6:30 p.m. at the U.S Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minn.</p>

<p>At least 27 girls and women said disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar sexually assaulted them while he was under FBI investigation for similar behavior, according to a new Saturday report from The New York Times. </p>
<p>Nassar first came under FBI suspicion in July 2015 after the agency received complaints from three top-tier female athletes, including two Olympic gymnasts. He was permitted to continue practicing medicine until September 2016, when the Indianapolis Star published damning accusations against him. </p>
<p>The sluggish pace of the FBI investigation ― split between agents in three cities ― allowed Nassar’s abuse to continue unnecessarily, the Times suggested. In a statement, the FBI responded, saying its investigation “transcended jurisdictions,” pointing to bureaucratic inefficiency as a possible explanation for the slow pace. (Bureaus in Indiana, Michigan and Texas were involved in the case.)</p>
<p>The list of young women accusing the now-convicted doctor of sexual abuse currently stands at 265. Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years in prison on seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in January, and he is currently awaiting sentencing on another three counts.</p>
<p>His case has prompted furious questions from accusers and their family members demanding to know why Nassar’s abuse continued for more than two decades. </p>
<p>The FBI investigation was slow from the start. USA Gymnastics officials first alerted agents about Nassar’s behavior 41 days after they were told a coach overheard a conversation between gymnast Maggie Nichols and Olympian Aly Raisman about the doctor’s uncomfortable techniques. Nassar was then a respected sports physician who worked at Michigan State University and traveled with USA Gymnastics. </p>
<p>A third gymnast, Olympian McKayla Maroney, then emerged as a “central complainant,” per the Times.</p>
<p>The information was quickly shared with the gymnasts’ parents and officials at USA Gymnastics, but it took more than a month for it to land at the FBI. Nichols’ mother told the Times that now-former USA Gymnastics president Steve Penny repeatedly asked her to keep the matter quiet as the organization figured out what to do.</p>
<p>The investigation into Nassar’s abuse accelerated with the 2016 Indianapolis Star report, containing accusations from two women not involved in the FBI’s probe. Nassar is expected to spend the rest of his life behind bars.</p>

<p>Sunday’s Puppy Bowl XIV will include two extra special canine athletes.</p>
<p>Every year, the event, which involves a bunch of adorable puppies frolicking around, serves as Animal Planet’s counter-programming to the Super Bowl. All of the participating dogs come from animal shelters or rescue groups, and this year, two of the puppies are animals rescued from Puerto Rico in the wake of Hurricane Maria.</p>
<p>Kaleb Jr. and Archer, both mixed-breeds, were transported to the U.S. mainland by The Sato Project, a nonprofit focused on helping Puerto Rico’s stray dogs, ABC News reports.</p>
<p>The Sato Project has sent puppies to the Puppy Bowl for the past seven years, according to Bustle, but this year its participation takes on a new significance as Puerto Rico struggles to recover from the hurricane. As of Wednesday, nearly 30 percent of Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority customers still had no power.</p>
<p>“We’re hoping these little dogs on Sunday are going to fly the flag high and proud and people will once again start to realize that the crisis isn’t over there and we are a part of the USA,” Sato Project founder Chrissy Beckles told ABC 7.</p>
<p>Kaleb Jr. and Archer have already been adopted by families in New York state, and both have been given new names — Murphy and Maddox, respectively, AM New York reports. They’re still called Kaleb Jr. and Archer in Puppy Bowl XIV promotional materials, though, so those are likely the names that will be used when the program airs.</p>
<p>Both pups now appear to have great lives and loving homes, according to what their families told AM New York. Maddox, aka Archer, is a “super loving” puppy who enjoys belly rubs. And Murphy, aka Kaleb Jr., is a friendly, sociable dog whose hobbies include trying to sneak bites of steak and chasing a cat named Milton.</p>
<p>The Sato Project still has other dogs available for adoption, though. The group is also accepting applications for temporary dog foster homes as well as for volunteers in both New York and Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>An independent investigation will look into former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar’s serial sexual abuse, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) announced on Friday, after widespread calls from athletes and public officials for greater scrutiny of the institutions that many say enabled his years of assaulting young women.</p>
<p>An outside law firm, Ropes and Gray, will lead the probe, the USOC said in a statement, aiming “to determine when individuals affiliated with USA Gymnastics or the USOC first became aware of any evidence of Nassar’s abuse of athletes, what that evidence was and what they did with it.”</p>
<p>Last week, a Michigan judge sentenced Nassar to up to 175 years in prison after he sexually assaulted more than 140 young women, including many Olympic gymnasts.</p>
<p>Many survivors and their families, as well as lawmakers and other public officials, have called for investigations into the institutions where Nassar worked, questioning the extent to which members knew about his abuse and whether they tried to cover it up.</p>
<p>Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles said earlier this week that she was surprised that the USOC had not contacted her to discuss Nassar’s abuse.</p>
<p>“I was one of their top athletes advocating for not only gymnastics but for the Olympics and all of that,” Biles said. “I think it’s kind of crazy, but hopefully they’ll reach out.”</p>
<p>Shortly following his sentencing last week, the USOC issued an open apology to Nassar’s victims and announced that it would allocate funding to testing, treatment and counseling for Nassar’s victims. It added it would institute systemic changes.</p>
<p>“We are sorry for the pain caused by this terrible man, and sorry that you weren’t afforded a safe opportunity to pursue your sports dreams,” the letter read.</p>
<p>It also issued an ultimatum to USA Gymnastics, the sport’s governing body, calling on its entire board to resign, or it would strip the organization’s certification.</p>
<p>According to the USOC, Ropes and Gray will have wide latitude in their investigation, which will “take as long as necessary to get to the truth.” Both the USOC and USA Gymnastics have agreed to turn over documents and provide interviews, and the firm will release a public report with its findings.</p>

<p>ZURICH, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Twenty-eight Russian athletes have had their Olympic doping bans overturned and their results from the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi reinstated after their appeals were upheld by sport’s highest tribunal on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said in a statement that it had found insufficient evidence during last week’s hearing in Geneva that the 28, banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), were guilty of anti-doping violations in Sochi.</p>
<p>However, it is not clear yet whether any of the 28 will be able to compete in the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, which start on Feb. 9.</p>
<p>“With respect to these 28 athletes, the appeals are upheld, the sanctions annulled and their individual results achieved in Sochi 2014 are reinstated,” said the Lausanne-based tribunal.</p>
<p>Eleven other athletes were confirmed by CAS to have committed doping violations. However, CAS reduced their lifetime Olympic bans to a suspension from this year’s Games.</p>
<p>The IOC had previously banned Russia from Pyeongchang as a result of its “unprecedented systematic manipulation” of the anti-doping system.</p>
<p>Individual Russian athletes are able to compete as neutrals if they can prove their anti-doping credentials but the IOC said on Thursday that the 28 would not necessarily be invited to Pyeongchang. “Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation,” it said.</p>
<p>The confirmation of eleven cases “clearly demonstrates once more the existence of the systemic manipulation of the anti-doping system at the Olympic Winter Games Sochi 2014,” it added.</p>
<p>The IOC regretted that CAS “did not take this proven existence of the systemic manipulation of the anti-doping system into consideration for the other 28 cases.”</p>
<p>Cross-country skier Alexander Legkov, who won gold in the 50 kilometers and silver in 4x10 km, and Alexander Tretyakov, who won gold in the men’s individual skeleton, were among those to be cleared.</p>
<p>Bobsleigh double gold medallist Alexander Zubkov was one of the eleven whose doping offenses were confirmed.</p>
<p>Russian Olympic Committee President Alexander Zhukov said the CAS ruling had restored the “good name” of Russian athletes, Interfax news agency reported.</p>
<p>Jim Walden, lawyer for Russia’s former anti-doping chief-turned whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov, said the ruling provided “a very small measure of punishment for some athletes but a complete ‘get out of jail free card’ for most.”</p>
<p>Walden added that Rodchenkov “testified fully and credibly” at CAS and his evidence was verified by forensic evidence and other whistleblowers.</p>
<p>Russia has repeatedly denied any state involvement in the doping which was exposed by an independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).</p>
<p>CAS said its mandate was “not to determine generally whether there was an organized scheme allowing the manipulation of doping control samples....but was strictly limited to dealing with 39 individual cases and to assess the evidence applicable to each athlete on an individual basis.”</p>
<p>A total of 43 Russian athletes were banned by the IOC. Three more are still waiting to have their appeals heard and one ― bobsledder Maxim Belugin ― has not appealed. </p>

<p>Over 265 young girls and women have accused former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse under the guise of medical treatment. </p>
<p>Judge Janice Cunningham announced the updated number on Wednesday in a Charlotte, Michigan, courtroom during Nassar’s second sentencing hearing ― on three additional counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. </p>
<p>“We have over 265 identified victims and an infinite number of victims in the state, in the country, and all over the world,” Cunningham said in the small courtroom Wednesday morning. </p>
<p>The three counts Nassar is being sentenced for include two girls between the ages of 13 and 15 years old, and one who is under 13. The charges focus on specific allegations of sexual abuse at a gymnastics club in Dimondale, Michigan, called Twistars. Nassar pleaded guilty to all three counts in November and is expected to receive a minimum of 25 to 40 years in prison. </p>
<p>Last week, the disgraced physician was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on seven child sexual abuse charges. Nassar is a serial child sexual predator and has pleaded guilty to digitally penetrating young athletes while treating them as a medical doctor. His youngest survivor was 6 at the time of the abuse. He’s already serving 60 years on child pornography charges. </p>
<p>A large number of the 265 identified survivors are the 156 women who read their impact statements in court during Nassar’s weeklong sentencing hearing that began on Jan. 16. Another 65 survivors are expected to read impact statements during this hearing, which is expected to go into next week. Cunningham noted in court that she expects that number to increase as the hearing continues. </p>
<p>About 30 women read victim impact statements in court on Wednesday, either in person or via video message, or had their statement read by a representative from the attorney general’s office. Many of the women said they were inspired to come forward with their stories after listening to the 150-plus women give their impact statements last week. </p>
<p>“No high schooler should have to know the inside of a court as well as I do,” victim and former gymnast Jessica Thomashow said in the first statement. </p>
<p>Thomashow, whose sister Amanda was also abused by Nassar, says as a gymnast she had been taught to grit her teeth and simply swallow pain, even during Nassar’s “treatments.”</p>
<p>“Larry Nassar is evil,” Thomashow said. “What you did to me was twisted, you manipulated me and my entire family. How dare you. ... For the rest of my life, I’m going to have to heal from what you did.”</p>
<p>Watch survivor and victim Annie Labrie give her impact statement below. </p>
<p>Another former gymnast, Tiffany Dutton, says she came forward with her story because of the “courage and bravery” of the other women who have already accused Nassar. Dutton said her mother was in the room when Nassar molested her.</p>
<p>“It takes a monster to sexually assault a child,” she said. “But it takes a monster backed by ego, experience and power, fueled by multiple institutions, to sexually assault a child in front of their own mother.” </p>
<p>An anonymous survivor, identified only as victim No. 124, called out MSU in her statement. </p>
<p>“Larry you might not remember me but I certainly remember you,” an assistant to the attorney general’s office read the statement. “You ― Larry Nassar ― used and abused my body for years for your own sexual gratification. ... MSU, I’m looking at you too. Lou Anna I know you resigned but you owe me and the other survivors one hell of an apology.” </p>
<p>Several officials at USA Gymnastics, MSU and the U.S. Olympic Committee have resigned in the face of harsh criticism. MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon resigned last week. The entire USA Gymnastics board resigned, and former Olympic coach John Geddert retired. The NCAA also opened an investigation into how MSU handled the Nassar case. On Tuesday, Congress passed a bill that aims to protect young athletes from sexual abuse and regulate governing bodies of amateur sports. </p>
<p>Nassar’s sentence will be handed down sometime next week. </p>

<p>New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said Monday night that he doesn’t want radio station WEEI to sack the host who called his 5-year-old daughter Vivian “an annoying little pissant.”</p>
<p>Alex Reimer used those words on Thursday commenting on a Facebook documentary about Brady in which the child informs her father she’s going to play soccer. Reimer was suspended indefinitely by the station. Brady on Monday morning cut short his weekly interview on another WEEI show to express his dismay over the comment and said he’s considering whether to stop appearing on the show.</p>
<p>But Brady struck a magnanimous tone later Monday in Minneapolis, the site of Sunday’s Super Bowl between the Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>“We all have careers and we all make mistakes,” he said at a press conference in the segment above from Boston’s CBS affiliate. “I’d hate for someone to have to change their life because of something like that. It’s certainly not what he intended.”</p>
<p>Brady also addressed what he said to WEEI earlier. “Any parent is protective of their kid,” he said. “I’ve never strayed away from criticism, that’s part of sports. But I don’t think my children or any other children deserve to be in that. That’s how I felt.”</p>

<p>Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman said she’s not satisfied with the 40- to 175-year prison sentence for former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor Larry Nassar, who has been accused of sexually abusing more than 150 girls. </p>
<p>“It’s like he got one year for each person, like that’s not enough,” Raisman told Us Weekly. </p>
<p>Raisman, a three-time Olympic gold medalist, revealed in November that Nassar abused her under the guise of medical treatment. Fellow gymnasts Simone Biles, Jordyn Wieber and McKayla Maroney also accused the former team doctor of sexual abuse.</p>
<p>“He’s gonna die in jail, but any number is never enough,” Raisman said. “I’m glad because so many people are watching and I hope that it does set an example to all the other abusers out there that their time is up and that abuse is never OK.”</p>
<p>Raisman has been an outspoken critic of USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University for allowing Nassar’s abuse for more than two decades. </p>
<p>“We have to fix the problem and the organizations,” Raisman said. </p>
<p>Before Nassar’s sentencing hearing began on Jan. 16, Raisman tweeted that USA Gymnastics is “100 percent responsible” for the abuse, adding: “We must understand how this happened to make sure it never occurs again... The system has to change so that athletes are safe.” </p>
<p>Raisman was one of more than 150 women to deliver victim impact statements in court during Nassar’s weeklong hearing. </p>
<p> “Larry, you do realize now that we, this group of women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time, are now a force and you are nothing,” she said in court.  </p>
<p>Nassar was sentenced last week on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. He had already been serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and awaits sentencing on three additionally counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. </p>
<p>“When I was little I only thought that I could be hurt by a stranger,” Raisman told Us Weekly. “I mean, you have to teach kids that it could be someone that you’re very close with and... we have to teach them grooming techniques so they understand the warning signs of a predator.” </p>

<p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has ordered additional law enforcement to investigate allegations of sexual assault at Walker County’s Karolyi Ranch, the former training facility for USA Gymnastics athletes.</p>
<p>Abbott’s Tuesday request asks that the Texas Rangers, a statewide law enforcement agency, join the Walker County Sheriff’s Office in its ongoing investigation. </p>
<p>“The public statements made by athletes who previously trained at the Karolyi Ranch are gut-wrenching,” Abbott said in a statement. “Those athletes, as well as all Texans, deserve to know that no stone is left unturned to ensure that the allegations are thoroughly vetted and the perpetrators and enablers of any such misconduct are brought to justice. The people of Texas demand, and the victims deserve, nothing less.”</p>
<p>USA Gymnastics, which had used Karolyi Ranch as its national team training center since 2001, cut ties with the Huntsville facility earlier this month after more than 140 women came forward with allegations that former team doctor Larry Nassar had sexually abused them, many while at the facility, under the guise of medical treatment. </p>
<p>More than 160 women and family members delivered impact statements during Nassar’s weeklong sentencing hearing. Nassar, who was already serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges, was given a 40- to 175-year prison sentence on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree and now awaits additional sentencing on three more counts of the same charge.</p>

<p>Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette says his office will conduct an “independent, thorough, transparent and prompt” investigation into Michigan State University in the wake of the Larry Nassar scandal.</p>
<p>According to dozens of survivors, Nassar sexually abused MSU athletes under the guise of medical treatment for over two decades during his tenure as the school’s trainer. Nassar was recently sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.</p>
<p>“It is abundantly clear that a full and complete investigation of what happened at Michigan State University — from the president’s office down — is required,” Schuette said during a Saturday news conference. “My department ... will find out who knew what and when, who took action, who failed to take action, what did or did not happen, and what should have happened.”</p>
<p>Schuette said the investigation began last year, but the attorney general’s office waited to announce the news until every survivor read her victim impact statement in court during sentencing. Over 160 survivors and family members read victim impact statements in court this month after a weeklong sentencing hearing for Nassar. </p>
<p>The investigation will be led by Bill Forsyth, a veteran prosecutor from Kent County, Michigan, with 42 years of experience who was named as the special independent counsel. Michigan State Police director Col. Kriste Etue, her team and a team of prosecutors from the attorney general’s office will assist in the investigation. </p>
<p>“I’ve been doing this for a long time and I have never seen anything like this,” Forsyth told CNN. </p>
<p>Schuette said this investigation is “priority one” for him and his office. </p>
<p>“No individual and no department at Michigan State University is off-limits,” he added. “Too many voices of too many victims had been unheard for too long.”</p>
<p>Schuette said he has asked Patrick Fitzgerald, MSU’s independent investigator turned legal counsel, to turn over any and all information the attorney has gathered while working on the Nassar case “to ensure our investigation leaves no stone unturned.” (Scroll down to see a copy of the letter from Schuette and Forsyth to MSU’s board of trustees obtained by HuffPost.) Once the investigation is concluded, Schuette said, the report will be available to the public. </p>
<p>In a statement following Schuette’s announcement, MSU’s board of trustees said it supports the investigation. </p>
<p>“We are committed to taking the right actions to create a culture that provides a safe environment for all members of our community, and the transition to new leadership will be a key component in helping us change course. The Board will play an integral role in these efforts and in making MSU a leader locally and nationally in preventing sexual abuse,” the statement reads. “We cannot change the past, but we can and will devote our time and resources to foster healing and move forward together.”</p>
<p>Nassar, who is serving an additional 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and awaits sentencing on three other counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, will be in prison for the rest of his life. Many of his survivors, however, are asking for the institutions that enabled him for so long to be held accountable. </p>
<p>Multiple Nassar victims say they reported his behavior to MSU coaches and other officials, but their complaints were repeatedly brushed under the rug. Others question whether USA Gymnastics knew of Nassar’s rampant abuse. At least 14 MSU representatives knew about Nassar’s abuse and failed to report it.</p>
<p>“I knew that he abused me. I reported it. Michigan State University had the audacity to tell me I did not understand the difference between sexual assault and a medical procedure,” survivor Amanda Thomashow said during her victim impact statement. </p>
<p>Fellow survivor Olivia Cowan added a similar sentiment in her impact statement: “MSU knew what was being done to these athletes and decided to turn a blind eye to keep their reputation strong and their pockets full.”</p>
<p>In the wake of the Nassar sentencing, heads have begun to roll with the resignation of MSU President Lou Anna K. Simon. The entire USA Gymnastics board resigned and former Olympic coach John Geddert retired. The NCAA opened an investigation into MSU and a congressional committee is scrutinizing major sports organizations, including USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee, about their policies against sexual abuse. </p>
<p>“We will put a bight light in every corner of the university,” Schuette said. “This will be done right. Period.” </p>

<p>Note to Pink: When you perform the national anthem at the Super Bowl next Sunday, be prepared for rough criticism.</p>
<p>Viewers checked Brett Young hard against the boards after his rendition at the NHL All-Star Game in Tampa, Florida, on Sunday. We didn’t think his performance was that bad. But people on Twitter sure did.</p>
<p>Now you judge.</p>
<p>The complaints about pace appear to be especially harsh. Yahoo pointed out that the rendition clocked in at about 1 minute, 50 seconds (we got 1:40-ish), well short of Alicia Keys’ 2:36 performance at the 2013 Super Bowl.</p>
<p>As for quality, Roseanne Barr made sure the bar will remain forever low with her 1990 version at a baseball game.</p>

<p>The Cleveland Indians will stop using their Chief Wahoo logo on game jerseys and caps starting in 2019, according to The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The decision has the support of the MLB, which has urged the team to decrease its use of the logo in recent years. Notably, the logo won’t be going away entirely. The ban extends only to on-field displays, meaning Chief Wahoo will still be a fixture on merchandise that’s available throughout northern Ohio.</p>
<p>“Major League Baseball is committed to building a culture of diversity and inclusion throughout the game,” MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred Jr. said in a statement Monday.</p>
<p>“Over the past year, we encouraged dialogue with the Indian’s organization about the Club’s use of the Chief Wahoo logo. During our constructive conversations, [team owner] Paul Dolan made clear that there are fans who have a longstanding attachment to the logo and its place in the history of the team,” Manfred continued. “Nonetheless, the club ultimately agreed with my position that the logo is no longer appropriate for on-field use … and I appreciate Mr. Dona’s acknowledgement that removing it from the on-field uniform by the start of the 2019 season is the right course.” </p>
<p>Manfred acknowledged the logo’s deeply problematic nature in April 2017, when the league awarded the 2019 All-Star Game to the Indians, and in related meetings pressured the team to “transition away from the Chief Wahoo logo,” MLB spokesman Pat Courtney said.</p>
<p>At the time, Bob DiBiasio, the Indians’ senior vice president of public affairs, indicated the team would be receptive to a future change. </p>
<p>“We certainly understand the sensitivities of the logo ― those who find it insensitive and also those fans who have a long-standing attachment to its place in the history of the team,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We fully expect to work with the Commissioner throughout the remainder of this season on finding a solution that is good for the game and our organization.”</p>
<p>The long-simmering issue escalated in the fall of 2016 during the American League Championship Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Indians, when an indigenous Canadian filed suit, seeking to prevent the logo from being used during games in Ontario.</p>
<p>The Change the Mascot campaign, a group that has long opposed the offensive logo, welcomed the Indians’ decision as a recognition “that Native Americans do not deserve to be denigrated as cartoon mascots.”</p>
<p>The group used the news to once again revive calls for the Washington football team to take similar action.</p>
<p>“For too long, people of color have been stereotyped with these kinds of hurtful symbols ― and no symbol is more hurtful than the football team in the nation’s capital using a dictionary-defined racial slur as its team name,” Oneida Nation Representative Ray Halbritter, the group’s leader, said in an emailed statement.</p>
<p>“Cleveland’s decision should finally compel the Washington football team to make the same honorable decision,” Halbritter continued. “Washington Owner Dan Snyder needs to look at Cleveland’s move and then look in the mirror and ask whether he wants to be forever known as the most famous purveyor of bigotry in modern sports, or if he wants to finally stand on the right side of history and change his team’s name.</p>
<p>“We hope he chooses the latter.”</p>
<p>The NFL team didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Tom Brady abruptly cut short a weekly radio interview Monday because a host at the same station called his 5-year-old daughter Vivian “an annoying little pissant.”</p>
<p>WEEI’s Alex Reimer made the remark on Thursday, and the Super Bowl-bound quarterback politely reprimanded the “Kirk & Callahan” team at the same station this morning. Brady, who has been a constant guest for years, said he would decide later if he’ll ever return to the show. </p>
<p>Reimer has been suspended indefinitely, the station said last week.</p>
<p>“I’ve tried to come on this show for many years and show you guys a lot of respect,” he said in the audio above. “I’ve always tried to come on and do a good job for you guys, so it’s very disappointing when you hear that, certainly with my daughter or any child. They certainly don’t deserve that.”</p>

<p>MELBOURNE, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Even after 20 grand slam titles, the tears gushing down Roger Federer’s cheeks after winning his sixth Australian Open crown on Sunday showed the competitive fires still rage within the 36-year-old Swiss.</p>
<p>Having regained control to put down sixth seed Marin Cilic 6-2 6-7(5) 6-3 3-6 6-1 under a closed roof at Rod Laver Arena, Federer promptly lost it at the end of his victory speech.</p>
<p>“And my team, I love you guys. Thank you,” Federer, cradling the Norman Brookes Cup, said with a quivering voice before breaking down in tears.</p>
<p>The show of emotion triggered a standing ovation in the terraces, the tears spreading to his wife Mirka and parents in the players’ box.</p>
<p>Tennis great Rod Laver, 79, snapped the moment on his mobile phone for posterity.</p>
<p>Joining Novak Djokovic and Roy Emerson as the only men to win six Australian Open trophies, Federer also emulated Laver by winning his fourth grand slam title after his 30th birthday.</p>
<p>“It is a different emotion, clearly. The first (grand slam title) is like ‘oh my god! I was able to win one’. The rest now doesn’t really matter at this point,” Federer told host broadcaster Channel Seven in front of hundreds of fans at Melbourne Park’s Garden Square.</p>
<p>“This one here tonight reminded me more of maybe the 2006 win when I beat (Marcos) Baghdatis in the finals.</p>
<p>“I had a great run to the finals (in 2006) and was a huge favorite going in ... I was just so relieved when everything was said and done I think I felt the same way tonight.</p>
<p>“That is why I couldn’t speak, it was terrible.”</p>
<p>Having qualified for an astonishing 30th grand slam final, Federer admitted that nerves had got the better of him during a scorching hot day as he waited to take his place for the evening match.</p>
<p>“My thoughts were all over the place. All day I was thinking ‘What if I lost? What if I won?’ Every minute of the day,” he said. “Thank God I slept to 11.”</p>
<p>The nerves returned for the Swiss at several stages through the three-hour three-minute clash, and he felt the trophy slipping from his grasp after the fourth set.</p>
<p>He had to save two break points in an epic service game at the start of the fifth set before riding the momentum home as Cilic’s power game wavered.</p>
<p>“At the end of the second (set) I got nervous and that is the reason I lost the second set and I couldn’t take control of the match,” added Federer.</p>

<p>In a show of support for the courageous survivors who were abused by sports doctor Larry Nassar, students flooded the stands with teal at Michigan State University’s basketball game Friday night.</p>
<p>The sea-colored supporters covered the Breslin Student Events Center’s student section, also known as the Izzone, for coach Tom Izzo. Teal is the official color of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, which occurs in April, according to the National Violence Resource Center.</p>
<p>MSU beat the University of Wisconsin, 76-61.</p>
<p>Over 140 women have accused Nassar of sexual abuse, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney and Simone Biles. </p>
<p>After dozens of women delivered emotional statements in court, Nassar, 54, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison for child sexual abuse this week. </p>
<p>Some students channeled Raisman’s fierce words to Nassar ― “You are nothing” ― by printing the statement on their apparel.</p>
<p>Raisman, who revealed in November that she was also a victim, expressed her disgust with Nassar last week in court.</p>
<p>“Larry, you do realize now that we, this group of women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time, are now a force and you are nothing,” the Olympic gymnast told the doctor.</p>
<p>“The tables have turned, Larry. We are here, and we are not going anywhere.”</p>
<p>In the wake of Nassar’s sentencing, MSU has faced its own firestorm of criticism. The university’s president, Lou Anna Simon, and athletic director, Mark Hollis, have succumbed to the pressure and resigned this week.</p>
<p> Nassar’s victims blame Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics for enabling the doctor to treat athletes even after allegations of abuse were reported. </p>
<p> Over the course of two decades, eight young women say they told at least 14 MSU staffers and representatives about Nassar’s sexual abuse, yet university officials did nothing to stop him, The Detroit News reported last week.  </p>
<p> Simon told Detroit News that she learned about abuse compliants against Nassar in 2014, when a Title IX complaint and police report were filed. </p>
<p> The university didn’t officially fire Nassar until September 2016. </p>

<p>Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman on Friday called on the U.S. Olympic Committee to first complete a full independent investigation into USA Gymnastics before the sport’s governing body elects new leaders.</p>
<p>Raisman tweeted her statement to the USOC in response to their letter to USAG on Thursday, in which they called for the entire board of directors to resign or else the sport’s governing body would lose their certification.</p>
<p>On Friday, USAG said it would comply with the USOC’s request to have all members of the board’s remaining 18 members resign. USAG chairman Paul Parilla, vice chairman Jay Binder and treasurer Bitsy Kelley resigned Monday.</p>
<p>In the Thursday letter, USOC CEO Scott Blackmun gave the USAG a list of steps it must take to reform the organization, including electing an interim board by the end of next month and cooperating in an independent investigation.</p>
<p>Raisman, however, believes that the investigation should be completed ― and all the people who enabled Larry Nassar’s abuse ousted ― before new members are elected to the board.</p>
<p>“I feel very strongly that unless and until an independent investigation is competed, we cannot be sure (1) we know the full extent of the problem, (2) that all the people who contributed to the problem have been removed and replaced, and (3) that the changes will effectively address the problem,” Raisman said in the statement.</p>
<p>The gymnast insisted that Nassar had more victims who haven’t yet spoken out and said that it was necessary to uncover any USAG staff or board members who may have “fostered” Nassar’s actions.</p>
<p>“What possible reason could there be for not making it a priority to know these things,” Raisman asked. “If we don’t investigate, it’s possible an individual who enabled Nassar could be appointed to the board OR the board could have the difficult task of overseeing staff that enabled Nassar.”</p>
<p>Raisman offered the USOC her own set of requirements, asking Blackmun to ensure the investigation operates “with complete independence” and requesting that the investigation’s findings be made public at the same time it’s delivered to the USOC and USAG.</p>
<p>Raisman, who was one of more than a hundred women who were molested by Nassar, has become one of the most vocal proponents to demand public accountability from the individuals and organizations who enabled Nassar’s rampant abuse.</p>
<p>During an interview with the “Today” show on Thursday, Raisman criticized USAG and the USOC for prioritizing winning over athletes’ safety.</p>
<p>Nassar “did not have a medical license in Texas, which is where we went to the ranch and trained,” Raisman said on the show. “It’s a national team training center and the Olympic training center ... so what does that say about USA Gymnastics and United States Olympic Committee? Whether they knew or didn’t know, that’s a big problem and we need to investigate how this happened.”</p>
<p>“For so long they put medals, reputation and money over the safety of athletes,” Raisman added. “Even now, you see the United States Olympic Committee ― they just spoke out Monday for the first time. They just released a statement for the first time. They have been quiet this whole time.”</p>

<p>Michigan State University’s top two coaches said they have no plans to quit their jobs despite a damning ESPN “Outside the Lines” report that claimed the school mishandled complaints of sexual abuse and violence against women involving its athletic department.</p>
<p>Mark Dantonio and Tom Izzo ― head coaches of MSU’s football and basketball teams, respectively ― sought Friday night to tamp down rumors of their departures following the ESPN report.</p>
<p>The school’s sexual abuse scandal began with accusations of serial assault of female gymnasts by former MSU doctor Larry Nassar, who was sentenced earlier this week to a lengthy prison term on seven counts of first-degree criminal sexual misconduct. MSU President Lou Anna Simon and Athletic Director Mark Hollis bowed to pressure to resign amid criticisms that school officials mishandled complaints of sexual abuse by Nassar years before he was formally charged in 2016.</p>
<p>But the scope of the scandal is widening. According to the ESPN report, MSU has attempted to shield people in its football and basketball programs accused of sexual abuse and violence against women in order to maintain the school’s reputation. ESPN said it found a “pattern of widespread denial, inaction and information suppression” in MSU’s response to sexual assault complaints involving the school’s athletic department.</p>
<p>At least 16 members of the football team have been accused of sexual assault or violence against women since Dantonio became head coach in 2007, ESPN reported, based on interviews and public records.</p>
<p>Dantonio called claims that he mishandled such accusations “completely false.” At a brief press conference, he said that “every incident reported in that article was documented by either police or the Michigan State Title IX office” that deals with gender equality issues.</p>
<p>He added: “I have always worked with the proper authorities when dealing with the cases of sexual assault.”</p>
<p>Rumors that he would be resigning are “absolutely false,” Dantonio also said.</p>
<p>The ESPN report said Dantonio appeared to make a false statement to reporters last spring when he referred to abuse complaints made against football players in 2017 as “new ground for us.”</p>
<p>The coach began his Friday remarks by addressing the scores of young women abused by Nassar. “It was absolutely heartbreaking to hear their stories and the pain and suffering they went through,” he said.</p>
<p>Izzo, asked about the ESPN report following a MSU basketball game, said he hadn’t had enough time to think about it.</p>
<p>“We will cooperate with any investigation going forward,” he said. “That’s about all I have to say about it.” </p>
<p>Asked about the resignation rumors, Izzo said, “I’m not going anywhere, in my mind.”</p>
<p>He added: “I’m definitely not retiring. And there’s a lot of things that happened today that are part of life. I’m gonna worry about my team, I’m gonna worry about the survivors, I’m gonna worry about what I do.”</p>
<p>In one incident detailed in the ESPN report, a student basketball coach, Travis Walton, was allowed to continue working after he was charged with assaulting a woman at a bar. Walton allegedly became agitated when the women asked him to leave her table, where she and a group were commemorating a deceased friend.</p>
<p>Later, a woman went to then-Athletic Director Hollis to accuse Walton and two MSU basketball players of raping her. According to ESPN, the student coach was dismissed from his job, but the players stayed on the team and in school.</p>
<p>The woman did not pursue her allegation with police, ESPN reported.</p>
<p>Sources told the outlet that abuse complaints involving members of MSU’s athletic department were often handled internally, sometimes even by coaches.</p>
<p>The Nassar case, which affected several of the country’s finest women gymnasts, raised sharp questions over MSU’s ability to process abuse complaints. Young women and girls reported the now-disgraced physician multiple times over decades, but he was not stopped.</p>
<p>A Lansing State Journal report published Friday accused the university of withholding information about an investigation it conducted into Nassar’s behavior following a 2014 complaint because it could open the school to lawsuits.</p>
<p>MSU is currently under investigation by the NCAA and Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette.</p>
<p>The NCAA, however, faced criticisms of its own when The Athletic outlet reported on Friday that the group’s president, Mark Emmert, was told about more than three dozen sexual assault reports made against MSU athletes, but did nothing about it.</p>
<p>MSU students showed support for abuse survivors at the school’s Friday night basketball game. Decked out in teal, the official color of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, some had adorned their outfits with poignant phrases from statements Nassar’s 160-plus accusers read in court this month. </p>

<p>The U.S. Olympic Committee is giving USA Gymnastics’ board of directors six days to resign or else have the entire organization stripped of its certification as a national governing body.</p>
<p>The call for the board’s resignation is one of six requirements that the USOC has handed to USAG in an attempt to completely reform the organization in the aftermath of the sexual abuse scandal involving Larry Nassar. The requirements were listed in a letter from USOC CEO Scott Blackmun to USAG’s board of directors.</p>
<p>The letter was reviewed by USA Today and obtained by BuzzFeed.</p>
<p>The first three requirements focus on the board’s resignation and the selection of a new board. The current board has six days to resign and an interim board needs to be established by Feb. 28.</p>
<p>USOC is also launching an independent investigation into USAG to find out who knew about Nassar’s rampant sexual abuse of female gymnasts, who should’ve known, and which officials failed to report the allegations.</p>
<p>According to Blackmun, an interim board must be selected a new board must be seated within 12 months. Requirements also include having a USOC-designated liaison present at all USAG board meetings, progress reports and an independent investigation into the extent of Larry Nassar’s abuse.</p>
<p>“Our position comes from a clear sense that USAG culture needs fundamental rebuilding,” Blackmun wrote to the baord. “This was the overarching finding in the Daniels report and it was demonstrated again in the recent testimony of Nassar’s victims.”</p>
<p>The Deborah Daniels’ Report, which Blackmun referred to, is the result of a six-month independent investigation commissioned by USAG and aimed at fixing problems within the organization. In June, Daniels, a former prosecutor, gave 70 recommendations to the organization, including prohibiting adult members from being alone with minor gymnasts.</p>
<p>Blackmun’s letter was submitted one day after Nassar, the 54-year-old disgraced sports doctor, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison for child sexual abuse. Nassar is accused of sexually assaulting more than one hundred athletes, including many Olympic gymnasts, under the guise of medical treatment. </p>
<p>During a week of victim impact statements, many of Nassar’s victims harshly criticized the leaders of USAG and Michigan State University, where Nassar worked, for allowing the doctor to continue treating athletes even while he was being investigated for sexual abuse.</p>
<p>On Monday, the chair, vice chair and treasurer of USAG resigned. The board of directors consists of 21 members. </p>
<p>In his letter to the board, Blackmun said that USAG must cooperate with an independent investigation looking into “exactly who knew and who should have known of USAG athlete reports of abuse by Dr. Nassar (and when) and did not report these allegations appropriately.” The investigation will also look into “systematic failures that may have contributed to these failures to report.” </p>
<p> Over 140 women have accused Nassar of sexual abuse, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney and Simone Biles. Court documents revealed that Nassar used the cover of medical treatments to fondle and digitally penetrate the gymnasts while he was the team doctor for USAG and MSU sports teams. In her victim impact statement, Raisman lashed out against her abuser in a powerful speech. </p>
<p>  “Larry, you do realize now that we ― this group of women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time ― are now a force and you are nothing,” Raisman said. “The tables have turned, Larry. We are here and we are not going anywhere.”  </p>

<p>The entire USA Gymnastics board has agreed to resign in the wake of a pervasive sexual abuse scandal involving disgraced team doctor Larry Nassar.</p>
<p>The decision is one of six demands the U.S. Olympic Committee laid out in a letter to the organization Thursday, seeking to reform the organization and prevent similar conduct from happening in the future.</p>
<p>Had USA Gymnastics not conceded to the requirements, the USOC would have terminated its status as a national governing body.</p>
<p>“USA Gymnastics completely embraces the requirements outlined in the Jan. 25, 2017 letter from the United States Olympic Committee and appreciates the opportunity to work with the USOC to accomplish change for the betterment of our organization, our athletes and our clubs,” the organization said in a statement Friday.</p>
<p>“We understand that the requirements imposed by the letter will help us enhance our ability to build a culture of empowerment throughout the organization, with an increased focus on athlete safety and well-being,” the statement continued. “Our commitment is uncompromising, and we hope everything we do makes this very clear.”</p>
<p>Three board members already resigned earlier this week, a move John Manly, an attorney who represents more than 100 Nassar victims, dismissed in a statement to HuffPost as “a public relations ploy to save a sinking ship of an organization.”</p>
<p>As a part of the USOC demands, USA Gymnastics must also seat a new board within 12 months, cooperate with an independent investigation into why it failed to escalate athletes’ reports of abuse by Nassar, and complete various organization-wide trainings.</p>
<p>That investigation is in addition to a separate independent inquiry, concluded last June, which resulted in 70 recommended organizational changes, including a prohibition on adult members being alone with minor gymnasts; a prohibition on unrelated adults sharing or being alone in a sleeping room with gymnasts; and prohibiting adult members from having out-of-program contact with gymnasts via email, text and social media.</p>

<p>“Charles Barkley would pick Krispy Kreme donuts for the first pick,” the Los Angeles Lakers fan wrote.</p>

<p>Olympic gymnasts Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and Jordyn Wieber are happy with the sentence of former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, who will spend the rest of his life behind bars for molesting children. </p>
<p>All three have accused Nassar of sexually abusing them under the guise of medical treatment, along with over 150 other women who share the same allegations. On Wednesday afternoon ― after a weeklong sentencing hearing where 169 survivors and family members read impact statements ― Nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. </p>
<p>In statements posted to Twitter, the three Olympians shared how grateful they are to the other survivors who spoke out against Nassar. </p>
<p>“Thank you fellow survivors for you courage, strength, and leadership, you have all had an overwhelming impact on me and I am proud to stand with you all ― today, tomorrow, and every day that follows,” Raisman wrote on Wednesday night. </p>
<p>The former USA team doctor and former Michigan State University trainer is already serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and awaits sentencing on three more counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.</p>
<p>Along with thanking her fellow survivors, Raisman thanked her family and friends, the larger gymnastics community, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina and the prosecutors and law enforcement that worked so tirelessly to get this case heard. </p>
<p>“As we continue to process our pain and suffering, it is my hope that in some way, sharing our impact statements is part of our healing process,” Raisman wrote. </p>
<p>Biles thanked both Aquilina and the other women who read impact statements during Nassar’s sentencing hearing. </p>
<p>“THANK YOU, YOU ARE MY HERO,” Biles wrote to Aquilina and added to her fellow survivors: “He will no longer have the power to steal our happiness or joy. I stand with every one of you.” </p>
<p>Wieber quoted a poem from Nikita Gill, adding: “Thank you to Judge Aquilina. Thank you to EVERY SINGLE person that came forward and shared their story, both in and out of the courtroom.” </p>

<p>The Philadelphia Eagles’ Fletcher Cox said Wednesday that he’d never watched the Super Bowl. In person. On television. Ever.</p>
<p>The defensive tackle, who will get a chance to play in the Super Bowl on Feb. 4 against the New England Patriots, excited reporters’ curiosity when asked about his memories of the big game at a press conference.</p>
<p>“Nah, man. You know, I don’t really watch football,” he answered during a surprising exchange covered by several outlets. “Ya’ll know that.”</p>
<p>“Not even the Super Bowl?” the reporter asked.</p>
<p>“Nah, I don’t watch sports. You know that.”</p>
<p>Another journalist, just to clarify, chimed in, “Not any of them?”</p>
<p>And Cox stuck to his guns, saying “No, I don’t watch sports.”</p>
<p>A similar exchange can be seen in a short clip posted on Twitter by SB Nation:</p>
<p>But evidence suggested otherwise. </p>
<p>This 2015 Cox tweet, found by Sports Illustrated, was posted shortly after the Patriots’ Malcolm Butler intercepted the Seattle Seahawks’ Russell Wilson to seal New England’s Super Bowl victory.</p>
<p>Freezing Cold Takes noticed the same thing, plus a comment about the 2012 game. </p>
<p>So maybe he listened to it on the radio?</p>

<p>Now that’s confidence in the underdog.</p>
<p>An unidentified gambler on Wednesday bet millions of dollars on the Philadelphia Eagles against the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl, an MGM sportsbook executive in Las Vegas told ESPN.</p>
<p>The casino’s Jay Rood wouldn’t divulge the gambler’s name or the exact amount of the bet. He said the person is a repeat customer, and made a “multimillion-dollar” wager on the Eagles. ESPN noted that the amount is one of the biggest reported Vegas sports bets in recent history.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sports handicapper and Pregame.com founder RJ Bell tweeted early Thursday that a gambler known as Sir Let It Ride had plunked down $3 million on the Eagles in Vegas and was looking to wager more. That may give credence to the video report above that Sir Let It Ride planned to risk a total of $10 million on the Eagles.</p>
<p>Sir Let It Ride won $14 million on the World Series between the victorious Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers, Sports Illustrated reported previously.</p>
<p>Sir Let It Ride’s identity isn’t known, but he’s reportedly younger than 30 and is Eastern European. And he appears to really like the Eagles in the big game.</p>
<p>As of Thursday morning, the Patriots were favored to win by 4.5 points or more at many sports books.</p>
<p>The Super Bowl is Feb. 4 in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>The vice chairman for Michigan State University’s board of trustees appeared to dismiss the damning Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal on Monday while defending the school’s president against calls to resign.</p>
<p>During an interview with Michigan radio show “Staudt on Sports,” trustee Joel Ferguson insisted that university president Lou Anna Simon was “the best president [MSU’s] ever had” and would not be leaving her post.</p>
<p>“She’s a fighter. Her overall, what she’s done for this university, she’s not going to get run out of there by what somebody else did,” he said.</p>
<p>Ferguson expressed the board’s support for Simon despite revelations that the school allowed Nassar, who is accused of sexually abusing over 140 women, to treat patients even while he was being investigated by university police for sexual assault. Nassar is serving a 60-year sentence on federal child pornography charges. In November, he pleaded guilty to 10 counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree.</p>
<p>Ferguson said that trustees met for a five-hour meeting, yet spent only 10 minutes talking about Simon.</p>
<p>“We had so many other things we were going over, we unanimously decided in that meeting right away ... we were going to support her staying as the president,” Ferguson said. “There’s so many more things going on at the university than just this Nassar thing.”</p>
<p>Hours after Ferguson’s radio interview, the NCAA announced it would be launching a formal investigation into the university’s handling of the allegations against Nassar.</p>
<p>Many were outraged that Ferguson appeared to dismiss the Nassar scandal.</p>
<p>Nassar’s victims blame Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics for enabling him to treat athletes even after allegations of abuse.</p>
<p>Over the course of two decades, eight young women say they told at least 14 MSU staffers and representatives about Nassar’s sexual abuse, yet university officials did nothing to stop him, the Detroit News reported last week. </p>
<p>The women say their warnings go back as far back as 1997, though Simon told Detroit News that she learned about Nassar’s abuse in 2014, when a Title IX complaint and a police report were filed.</p>
<p>The university didn’t officially fire Nassar until two years later, in September 2016.</p>
<p>“I was informed that a sports medicine doctor was under investigation,” Simon told Detroit News on Wednesday. “I told people to play it straight up, and I did not receive a copy of the report. That’s the truth.” </p>
<p>Olivia Cowen, who said Nassar abused her 10 years ago, delivered a victim’s impact statement in front of the former physician last week while holding Michigan State University accountable for his abuse. She is one of more than a hundred women who are delivering victim impact statements during Nassar’s week-long sentencing hearing.</p>
<p>“I’ve gone from a raving fan of MSU to now seeing green and white in the very same way I see Larry Nassar,” Cowan said in court last Wednesday. “I want MSU and USAG to know what they have done is on the very same level of accountability as the crime Nassar has committed.”</p>
<p>Cowan later added, “As if the struggle of what Larry Nassar did isn’t bad enough, it’s horrifying that MSU and USA Gymnastics are not stepping up to the plate to admit their wrongdoing.”</p>
<p>An editorial in the State News, Michigan State University’s independent student-run newspaper, also called for Simon to resign, urging the president to “make the right choice, because time’s up.”</p>
<p>Several state lawmakers have also asked Simon to step down as university president.</p>
<p>But Ferguson told “Staudt on Sports” that the university board of trustees wanted to keep Simon as president, and emphasized her ability to make money.</p>
<p>“When you go to the basketball game, you walk in that new Breslin [Student Events Center], and the person who hustled and got all those major donors to give money was Lou Anna Simon,” he said.</p>
<p>Ferguson added that while the board of trustees wants Simon as president, trustees would be happy to have the attorney general review the investigation independently. </p>
<p>“Whatever they say, we’ll live with that,” Ferguson said. “But we certainly won’t do anything before the thing, because we actually believe that ... our senior people were not complicit in what this pervert did.”</p>

<p>The NCAA has formally opened an investigation into Michigan State University’s handling of the allegations against Larry Nassar, the school’s disgraced former team doctor who has been accused of sexually abusing more than 140 women, The New York Times reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The NCAA confirmed the news in a statement late Tuesday.</p>
<p>“The NCAA has sent a letter of inquiry to Michigan State University regarding potential NCAA rules violations related to the assaults Larry Nassar perpetrated against girls and young women, including some student-athletes at Michigan State,” the group said. “We will have no further comment at this time.”</p>
<p>Jason Cody, a spokesman for Michigan State University, said the school’s athletic department had received the letter and was reviewing it.</p>
<p>More than a hundred women have read victim impact statements during Nassar’s week-long sentencing hearing, set to conclude later this week. The physician pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct and faces a minimum of 25 years in prison. He was already sentenced to 60 years in prison in December for child pornography.</p>
<p>Many of the women say they told parents, coaches and trainers at Michigan State University about Nassar’s abuse, but that the allegations were overlooked or hidden.</p>
<p>Michigan State University’s former gymnastics coach Kathie Klages retired last February as allegations against Nassar began to pile up. She has been accused of covering up the accusations, according to the Times.</p>
<p>Jessica Smith, who said Nassar abused her for months when she was 17, told HuffPost’s Alanna Vagianos that many of those involved haven’t faced proper punishment for overlooking the complaints.</p>
<p>“I’m sick of MSU trying to look good instead of be good,” Smith said earlier this month.</p>

<p>The U.S Olympic Committee issued an open letter on Wednesday apologizing to the victims of former gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar.</p>
<p>Minutes after Nassar was sentenced to serve 40 to 175 years in prison on counts of criminal sexual conduct, the USOC published a letter to his victims, which included Team USA gymnasts Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney. Nassar pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting young girls under the guise of medical treatment.</p>
<p>The USOC published its letter after hearing 169 survivors and their family members gave victim impact statements for more than a week leading up to Nassar’s sentencing. The convicted sex offender preyed on more than 140 young athletes during his time working for USA Gymnastics and various Michigan State University sports teams. </p>
<p>“We are sorry for the pain caused by this terrible man, and sorry that you weren’t afforded a safe opportunity to pursue your sports dreams,” the USOC statement read.</p>
<p>The USOC said the purpose of its letter was to apologize to the victims and lay out the steps the organization would take to protect athletes. The committee vowed to initiate changes within the USOC and the national governing bodies that oversee individual sports to prevent abuses in the future.</p>
<p>“We Must Change the Culture of the Sport,” the statement listed as the first change: “This was the primary recommendation of the independent Deborah Daniels Report on USA Gymnastics and the athlete testimony underlined its importance. We heard athletes describe being unsure or unaware of how to report abuse and to whom, and sometimes even what constitutes abuse. We heard athletes describe being afraid or discouraged from reporting abuse.” </p>
<p>In the letter, the USOC also announced it would launch an investigation by an independent third party to see how Nassar was enabled to commit his abuses for so long. Three USA Gymnastics directors resigned on Monday and the USAG suspended Olympic gymnastics coach John Geddert, who had a close relationship with Nassar. USAG also cut ties with the national team training center, Karolyi Ranch, where much of Nassar’s abuse occurred.</p>
<p>“We need to know when complaints were brought forward and to who,” the USOC statement read. “This investigation will include both USAG and the USOC, and we believe USAG will cooperate fully. We will make the results public.”</p>
<p>Raisman, a six-time Olympic medalist, accused the USAG of victim-shaming and enabling years of sexual misconduct. The 23-year-old gymnast called out the organization earlier this month in a series of tweets where she said the problem extended beyond Nassar and former USAG President Steve Penny. </p>
<p>“We must investigate to figure out the many flaws in @USAGym system,” Raisman tweeted. “We must understand how this happened to make sure it never occurs again. This problem is bigger than Penny and Nassar. The system has to change so that athletes are safe. Enablers need to be held accountable.”</p>
<p>The USOC also announced in its letter that it would devote funds to testing, treatment and counseling for Nassar’s victims. </p>

<p>Hey, Super Bowl, you may have some unfriendly visitors coming your way.</p>
<p>A video of abusive Philadelphia Eagles fans taken Sunday by a Minnesota Vikings supporter has gone viral. The footage shows the home team faithful hurling F-bombs and raising middle fingers in 80 seconds of sheer ugliness before the Eagles prevailed in the NFC Championship to reach the big game.</p>
<p>“A short snippet of what we walked through to get into the stadium!” Vikings fan April Thomas said of the video, which she posted Sunday. She tagged it #phillyfansshouldbeashamed. The clip has been viewed millions of times.</p>
<p>If there were a Super Bowl for swearing, these folks would have advanced to it, so consider yourself warned:</p>
<p>Thomas didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>At least this group didn’t pelt the Vikings’ team bus with beer cans afterward as another did ― reinforcing the Philly loyalists’ notorious reputation.</p>
<p>Here’s more reported beer can-throwing ― at Vikings fans this time:</p>
<p>Remember, this is the same fan base that legendarily booed Santa Claus and pelted him with snowballs at an Eagles game.</p>

<p>Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor who treated some of America’s best athletes, was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison Wednesday for sex crimes that have shaken the sport’s governing body.</p>
<p>Nassar, 54, will spend the rest of his life behind bars as a result of Michigan Circuit Judge Rosemarie Aquilina’s sentence on seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree. </p>
<p> “I’ve just signed your death warrant,” Aquilina said after handing down the sentence.  </p>
<p>The judge gave a lengthy and powerful explanation of how she viewed Nassar’s apology and calculated his sentence. “It was not treatment what you did. It was not medical,” she told Nassar. “You do not deserve to walk outside of a prison ever again.” </p>
<p>She also called on federal authorities to investigate how Nassar’s abuse was allowed to go on for so long. “Justice requires more than what I can do on this bench,” Aquilina said. </p>
<p>Michigan Assistant Attorney General Angela Povilaitis called Nassar a “master manipulator” in her closing argument. </p>
<p>“The breadth and ripple of this defendant’s abuse and destruction is nearly infinite,” Povilaitis told the court. “The defendant is a twisted, beloved, renowned doctor who used his prestige to gain trust of these girls and exploit them.”</p>
<p>Nassar, in his statement to the court, said he will carry his victims’ words “for the rest of my days.” </p>
<p>“Your words these past several days have had a significant emotional effect on myself and has shaken me to my core,” Nassar said, turning to face survivors in the courtroom. “I also recognize what I’m feeling pales in comparison to the pain, trauma and emotional destruction you are all feeling.”</p>
<p>Nassar, 54, pleaded guilty to the crimes on Nov. 22, and admitted that he sexually assaulted young girls under the guise of medical treatment. He’s already serving a 60-year sentence on federal child pornography charges, and still faces sentencing for three additional criminal sexual conduct crimes in Michigan. Prosecutors had asked the judge to sentence Nassar to 40 to 125 years.</p>
<p>The judge allowed Nassar’s victims to deliver or read impact statements in her Lansing, Michigan, courtroom. For seven days, Nassar was forced to listen as 169 survivors and family members read statements that were emotional, cathartic and powerful.</p>
<p>“Little girls don’t stay little forever. They turn into strong women that return to destroy your world,” Nassar family friend Kyle Stephens said in her impact statement last week. Stephens, who said Nassar began molesting her when she was 6, was the first woman to read her statement in court. </p>
<p>Over 140 women have accused the now-disgraced doctor of sexual abuse, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, McKayla Maroney and Simone Biles. According to court documents, Nassar gained the trust of girls and their families, which then gave him cover for exams that allowed him to fondle and digitally penetrate the girls as team doctor for USA Gymnastics and various Michigan State University sports teams. </p>
<p> “Larry, you do realize now that we ― this group of women you so heartlessly abused over such a long period of time ― are now a force and you are nothing,” Raisman said in her victim impact statement. “The tables have turned, Larry. We are here and we are not going anywhere.” </p>
<p> Raisman revealed in November that Nassar sexually abused her during her time on the USA Gymnastics Olympic team.   “I was just so scared and nervous about what people were going to think,” Raisman said in a November interview. “I was a textbook victim, brainwashed to believe I was fine.”  Many of Nassar’s victims told how the abuse has affected them, with stories of PTSD, family issues, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, intimacy issues, a distrust of men, a distrust of doctors, shame, guilt and suicidal thoughts. “I was a carefree silly little girl until this happened, and afterwards there was a cloud and the cloud has followed me into every relationship in my life, especially the most important ones,” survivor Lyndsy Carr said in her statement.  Dancer Jessica Smith told of debilitating migraines she experiences because of the trauma from Nassar’s abuse.  “Since being victimized, I suffer from a rare form of extreme migraines that no neurologist has been able to fully understand or diagnose,” Smith said in court. ”... These migraines begin with half of my body going numb, including my tongue, causing me to be unable to speak. I also lose basic functioning skills such as fine motor and even gross motor. The effects of my migraines can cause me to be confused and unable to think straight for up to days after the initial searing headaches. This in addition to my anxiety and inability to sleep leaves me in an unhealthy state both physically and emotionally.”   </p>
<p>The first public allegation against Nassar came in September 2016, a year before the #MeToo movement took off. He was let go by USA Gymnastics in 2015, and was subsequently fired from his faculty position at MSU. He was arrested for possessing at least 37,000 images of child pornography in December 2016, and in July pleaded guilty to three federal counts relating to child pornography. He was sentenced to 60 years in prison in December.</p>
<p>Many of Nassar’s victims said they told coaches, parents and trainers about the abuse, but it continued. The Detroit News reported that at least 14 Michigan State University staffers and representatives were warned about Nassar’s abuse over the course of two decades, and failed to stop it. </p>
<p>Dozens of victims called out the university and USA Gymnastics.</p>
<p>“A simple fact is this: If Michigan State University, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee had paid attention to any of the red flags in Larry Nassar’s behavior, I never would have met him, I never would have been ‘treated’ by him, I never would have been abused by him,” Maroney said in her impact statement. </p>
<p>MSU doctor Brooke Lemmen and MSU gymnastics coach Kathie Klages have both resigned in the face of mounting accusations. The dean of MSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, William D. Strampel, took a medical leave from his position in December.</p>
<p>The president of USA Gymnastics, Steve Penny, resigned in March. Three of the organization’s directors resigned this week, and John Geddert, who coached the American 2012 Olympic team and reportedly was close with Nassar, was suspended.</p>
<p>“I knew that he abused me. I reported it,” Nassar victim Amanda Thomashow said in her impact statement. “Michigan State University had the audacity to tell me I did not understand the difference between sexual assault and a medical procedure.”</p>
<p>Emma Ann Miller, 15, in an emotional impact statement this week, said that after Nassar’s case, she and other survivors will be coming for the school. </p>
<p>“The best part of my story, titled Miller vs. MSU, is I know I’m not alone,” Miller told the judge. “You see, Your Honor, we are just getting started.”</p>
<p>CORRECTION: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this story said Kyle Stephens was a gymnast. In fact, she was a Nassar family friend.</p>

<p>Jake Tapper, the CNN host who often calls out President Donald Trump and politicians of both parties, went further afield on Monday to offer his views on the Super Bowl. Well, on one team in particular.</p>
<p>“The Patriots are cheaters, Brooke,” he told CNN colleague Brooke Baldwin. “The Patriots cheat. This is just a fact as established by investigations. They’re a cheating team. .. I mean, the facts speak for themselves.”</p>
<p>Tapper posted a photo of him in team garb attending the Philadelphia Eagles’ NFC title win over the Vikings with his father on Sunday. So clearly the guy has his bias as his favorite team prepares to face the Patriots in the Super Bowl on Feb. 4. </p>

<p>Heck, why not.</p>
<p>His CNN associate, Patriots fan John Berman, hit back on Twitter and a fun little social media scrimmage ensued. </p>

<p>UPDATE: 3:45 p.m. ― Former women’s Olympic coach John Geddert is retiring from gymnastics, he announced Monday in an email to athletes who train at his Michigan gym and their families.</p>
<p>He sent the email, which was obtained by the Lansing State Journal, shortly after USA Gymnastics announced his suspension. </p>
<p>“At a time when we should only be paying attention to the courageous young women who have demonstrated their commitment to the truth, the governing body of our sport is doing everything to upstage their victim statements,” he wrote. </p>
<p>Geddert wrote in the email that he was “not perfect” but said he was “deeply committed to protecting the safety and well-being” of his athletes. </p>
<p>“Most of you have noticed that I have been taking a back seat this year,” Geddert wrote. “This has been party of my exit strategy to retire at age 60. Well 60 is here... Gymnastics has been my life for 45 years. I really know nothing else. I have poured every ounce of my being into creating a place where aspiring kids could be challenged and directed towards their goals.” (Read the full email here.) </p>
<p>PREVIOUSLY:</p>
<p>USA Gymnastics has suspended former women’s Olympic gymnastics coach John Geddert, who reportedly was close to former team doctor Larry Nassar, the organization said Monday night.</p>
<p>Geddert was the head coach for the women’s gymnastics team during the 2011 World Championships and the 2012 London Olympics, and was personal coach to Olympic champion Jordyn Wieber. He reportedly was close with Nassar, who awaits sentencing in Michigan on sex crimes charges, and owned two training centers where Nassar worked as team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. </p>
<p>“John Geddert has been suspended under the interim measures provisions of Section 10.5 of USA Gymnastics’ Bylaws. USA Gymnastics is unable to comment further as this is a pending matter,” the organization said in a statement. </p>
<p>Neither Geddert nor USA Gymnastics immediately responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.</p>
<p>Three USA Gymnastics directors resigned on Monday amid criticism that the organization failed to protect its athletes from Nassar. </p>
<p>According to USA Gymnastics bylaws, Section 10.5 states that interim measures “may be imposed to ensure the safety and well-being of the gymnastics community or where an allegation is sufficiently serious that an Adverse Party’s continued participation could be detrimental to the sport or its reputation.”</p>
<p>Nassar, accused of sexually abusing more than 140 girls and women, is sitting through a sentencing hearing on charges of first-degree sexual misconduct in Lansing, Michigan. The hearing, which began last week, is continuing this week as 144 women are set to read victim impact statements. </p>
<p>According to a recent investigative report from Outside the Lines, Geddert and Nassar “were all but inseparable, professionally and socially,” and some people questioned whether Geddert knew about Nassar’s predatory behavior.</p>
<p>At least one athlete said in her victim impact statement during that Geddert walked into the room while Nassar was molesting her.</p>
<p>Geddert and Nassar first began working together at the Great Lakes Gymnastics Club. Later, in 1996, Geddert brought Nassar on to work at the gym he currently owns, Twistars USA Gymnastics Club. According to court documents, several young women say they were sexually abused by Nassar at Twistars. </p>
<p>Geddert was competitive and was borderline abusive, verbally and physically, to gymnasts, according to Outside the Lines. </p>
<p>“John’s very good at emotional manipulation. He can make you feel like nothing very quickly,” former office manager at Twistars, Priscilla Kintigh, told Outside the Lines. “Larry was the one to calm the girls down when they had a practice with John.” </p>
<p>Nassar is already serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. Prosecutors are seeking at least 40 additional years on the molestation charges.</p>

<p>The 95th witness to deliver an impact statement at the sentencing hearing for disgraced former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University doctor Larry Nassar said the school is still billing her family for appointments where she was allegedly sexually abused.</p>
<p>Emma Ann Miller, 15, stood beside her mother in a Lansing, Michigan, courthouse on Monday to deliver her statement. In her powerful, 19-minute testimony, Miller said she had known Nassar for years and experienced frequent sexual abuse by the doctor.</p>
<p>The last “treatment,” she said, occurred in August 2016, a week before MSU terminated his employment following a complaint filed against him by Rachael Denhollander. </p>
<p>“I’m possibly the last child he will ever assault,” Miller said.</p>
<p>She said that even in the wake of dozens of women and girls coming forward with allegations of Nassar’s sexual abuse, “My mom is still getting billed” by MSU Sports Medicine “for appointments where I was sexually assaulted.”</p>
<p>A representative from MSU told HuffPost on Monday that “patients of former MSU physician Larry Nassar will not be billed.”</p>
<p>Nassar was sentenced to 60 years in federal prison in December on child pornography charges. He has also been accused of serially sexually abusing over 125 women when they were minors. The former USAG doctor pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct in November.</p>
<p>Amid the disturbing revelations about Nassar’s conduct, many of his victims have accused MSU and USAG of not doing enough to halt the abuse. The Detroit News reported last week that at least 14 MSU staffers and representatives were warned about Nassar’s sexual abuse over the course of two decades and allegedly did nothing to stop it.</p>
<p> MSU has repeatedly denied covering up Nassar’s behavior.  </p>
<p>  “Any suggestion that the university covered up Nassar’s horrific conduct is simply false,” MSU spokesperson Jason Cody told HuffPost earlier this month. “Nassar preyed on his victims, changing their lives in terrible ways. ... MSU is truly sorry for the abuse all victims suffered, the pain it caused, and the pain it still causes.” Amid the criticism of USAG, three members of its board of directors ― including Chairman Paul Parilla ― resigned, effective on Sunday In her statement, Miller urged Nassar to “do the right thing” by writing down a list of all the times officials with MSU, USAG or Twistars, a local gymnastics club, might have stopped him. “Tell us who knew what and when,” she said. “Tell us about the signs MSU, Twistars, USAG should have seen but didn’t.” She added that while doing so might not affect his sentence, “it may just start you down on your road of reformation.” “Just remember, Larry, it’s never too late to do the right thing.” Alanna Vagianos contributed to this report.  </p>

<p>Football fans were utterly distressed Sunday night as the New England Patriots secured a spot in yet another Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The Patriots scored in the last quarter of the AFC championship against the Jacksonville Jaguars in a 20-24 win. Jacksonville was leading for the majority of the game and was up by 3 points in the fourth quarter when Patriots receiver Danny Amendola scored with less than 3 minutes left in the game.</p>
<p>This marks the eighth Super Bowl appearance for the team since 2000, and while Patriots fans are rejoicing, quite a few football fans are tired of the team’s repeated arrival to the biggest game in the NFL. </p>

<p>Better stock up on body oil, Pyeongchang.</p>
<p>Pita Taufatofua, the swooned-over shirtless Tongan flag-bearer from the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, qualified for the Winter Olympics in cross-country skiing over the weekend.</p>
<p>“A miracle happened,” he wrote on his Instagram.</p>
<p>After failed bids in Poland and Armenia in the last few weeks, he barely beat Sunday’s deadline for qualifying, the Wall Street Journal reported. Taufatofua earned his Olympic berth at an event in Isafjordur, Iceland.</p>
<p>“I gave it absolutely everything,” he told the Journal. “I died at the end.”</p>
<p>Taufatofua was able to meet a five-race standard with the help of four roller-skiing events on dry land prior to his successful snow trial, the Journal noted. </p>
<p>Taufatofua was a bigger hit in the opening and closing ceremonies in Rio than he was in his sport, taekwondo. He lost in the first round.</p>
<p>Given that his first skiing lesson was in January of last year, according to CNN, his presence will likely give the games more of a PR jolt than anything.</p>
<p>He told the Journal he is planning his games entrance, if he can round up the funding to get there. A parka won’t make quite the splash his coconut-oil-slathered torso did during the last go-round, so it’ll be interesting to see what he comes up with.</p>

<p>Three USA Gymnastics directors have resigned amid fierce criticism that the organization failed to protect its athletes from team doctor Larry Nassar, a serial predator whose sentencing hearing continues this week. </p>
<p> “USA Gym Board of Directors executive leadership ― Chairman Paul Parilla, Vice Chairman Jay Binder & Treasurer Bitsy Kelley ― tendered their resignations, effective Jan. 21, 2018,” a tweet from the organization on Monday says. “The Board of Directors will identify an interim chairperson until a permanent selection is named.” The announcement comes during Nassar’s sentencing hearing on 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct, which began Jan. 16 and will end later this week. The former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor has been accused of sexually abusing over 140 young girls under the guise of medical treatment over the course of two decades. </p>
<p>Kerry Perry, president and CEO of USA Gymnastics, said she supports the resignations. </p>
<p>“We believe this step will allow us to more effectively move forward in implementing change within our organization,” Perry said in a statement. “As the board identifies its next chair and fills the vacant board positions, we remain focused on working every day to ensure that our culture, policies and actions reflect our commitment to those we serve.”</p>
<p>USA Gymnastics did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for further comment. </p>
<p>Attorney John Manly, who represents more than 100 Nassar victims, called the resignation “a public relations ploy” in a statement to HuffPost. </p>
<p>“In speaking with some of our clients this morning, all of them wondered whether USAG will change the position they have taken in court that USAG had no duty to warn its member gymnasts even though they knew Larry Nassar was a molester,” he said. “Until that happens, this move is simply a public relations ploy to save a sinking ship of an organization.”</p>
<p>Manly demanded Congress open an investigation into how the U.S. Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics and MSU have handled the Nassar accusations. He added that many of the board members who remain were “well aware of USAG’s concealment of sexual abuse, its non-compliance with reporting statutes and harsh treatment of sexual abuse survivors.” </p>
<p>“It should not have more than 100 young women publicly baring their souls about their sexual assault by Larry Nassar to finally get USAG to act,” Manly said. “It’s important to note that 54 USAG Coaches have been credibly accused of sexually molesting little girls and boys in the last 20 years. Child molestation is a cancer in USAG and those responsible need to be completely ousted from the organization so there is nothing left of their influence.”</p>
<p>More than 100 women have read victim impact statements during Nassar’s sentencing. Many called out USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University for disregarding or failing to report warnings about Nassar’s abuse. </p>
<p>It appears the organizations “only see us as a financial burden that needs to be silenced and squashed, devalued and discredited all while trying to say they are sorry it happened to us and are on our side,” survivor Larissa Boyce recently told HuffPost. </p>
<p>Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman wrote in a series of tweets this month that USA Gymnastics is “100 percent responsible” for Nassar being allowed to continue his abuse for so long. </p>
<p>  “We must understand how this happened to make sure it never occurs again,” Raisman tweeted. ”... The system has to change so that athletes are safe. Enablers need to be held accountable.”   </p>
<p>The president of USA Gymnastics, Steve Penny, resigned in March 2017 amid the investigation.</p>
<p>Nassar is already serving 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and faces a minimum of an additional 25 years on the sexual misconduct charges. </p>

<p>Jim Johannson, assistant executive director for USA Hockey and the general manager of the 2018 American Olympic team without NHL players, has died at the age of 53.</p>
<p>USA Hockey announced that Johannson passed away in his sleep early Sunday morning at his home in Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p>
<p>“We are beyond shocked and profoundly saddened,” USA Hockey executive director Pat Kelleher said in a statement. “As accomplished as Jim was in hockey, he was the absolute best, most humble, kind and caring person you could ever hope to meet. His impact on our sport and more importantly the people and players in our sport have been immeasurable. Our condolences go out to his entire family, but especially to his loving wife Abby and their young daughter Ellie.”</p>
<p>Johannson was with USA Hockey since 2000 in various roles. During his time, Team USA won 64 medals (34 gold, 19 silver, 11 bronze) in international tournaments.</p>
<p>He played college hockey at Wisconsin (1982-86), helping the Badgers win an NCAA title his freshman year. He played for the United States in the 1988 and 1992 Olympics, scoring two goals. He was drafted by the Hartford Whalers in the seventh round in 1982 but didn’t make it to the NHL, playing in the International Hockey League from 1987 to 1994.</p>
<p>Johannson helped assemble the 2018 men’s team, which will be using non-NHL players for the first time since the 1994 Olympics. Tony Granato, one of Johannson’s teammates on the 1988 team, is the coach of this year’s U.S. Olympic team for the Games starting Feb. 9 in South Korea.</p>
<p>“Jim’s positive influence was enormous and will be felt for generations to come,” said Jim Smith, president of USA Hockey. “He was widely respected across the world and his genuine nature helped advance our sport in so many ways. Today, we are a medal contender every time we put a team on the ice for international competition, and he played a major role in helping us get to that point. Our heartfelt condolences go out to his entire family. It’s a sad day for all of us.”</p>

<p>Accusations from eight young women about the former USA Gymnastics and MSU team doctor’s behavior reportedly reached trainers, coaches, an MSU police detective and MSU President Lou Anna Simon, dating back to 1997. Simon learned about the problem in 2014 when a Title IX complaint and a police report were filed against an unidentified doctor. </p>
<p>“I was informed that a sports medicine doctor was under investigation,” Simon told the News on Wednesday after she appeared in court for Nassar’s sentencing hearing. “I told people to play it straight up, and I did not receive a copy of the report. That’s the truth.” </p>
<p>MSU has repeatedly denied covering up Nassar’s behavior in any way. </p>
<p> “Any suggestion that the university covered up Nassar’s horrific conduct is simply false,” MSU spokesperson Jason Cody told HuffPost earlier this month. “Nassar preyed on his victims, changing their lives in terrible ways. As President Simon has said, MSU is truly sorry for the abuse all victims suffered, the pain it caused, and the pain it still causes.” According to the Detroit News, the people who were told of Nassar’s abuse include former MSU head gymnastics coach Kathie Klages, current volleyball team trainer Lianna Hadden, current gymnastics team trainer Destiny Teachnor-Hauk, former MSU clinical psychologist Dr. Gary Stollak and officers at the Meridian Township Police Department.  The eight women who reported Nassar’s abuse to the university include gymnast Larissa Boyce, runner Christie Achenbach, softball player Tiffany Thomas Lopez, Nassar family friend Kyle Stephens, soccer and tennis player Brianne Randall-Gay and gymnast Amanda Thomashow (whose sister Jessica has also accused the doctor). </p>
<p> Larissa Boyce, who is believed to be one of the first victims to report Nassar’s behavior, said she talked to Kathie Klages in 1997. The gymnastics coach allegedly told Boyce that she must have misunderstood the medical procedure. Now 37, Boyce said Nassar abused her from 1997 to 2001, beginning when she was 16.   “They are denying any responsibility, saying they didn’t know a predator was among them,” Boyce told HuffPost earlier this month. “That is like a slap in the face to the ... girls who over the past 20 years told multiple MSU employees and [they] did nothing about it. How is that not showing their complete negligence?”  Christie Achenbach said she reported Nassar’s behavior to assistant running coach Kelli Bert in 1999, but nothing ever came of it. Bert told the Detroit News that she didn’t recall the interaction.  “If he had done something sexual, I believe I would have reported that immediately,” Bert said.  Tiffany Thomas Lopez said she told Lianna Hadden, then an MSU softball trainer, in 2000 that Nassar had sexually abused her during a medical exam. Hadden reportedly told another trainer, Destiny Teachnor-Hauk, who assured Thomas Lopez that the exam was “actual medical treatment.” During this week’s sentencing hearing, Jennifer Rood Bedford, a former MSU volleyball player, said she also reported Nassar’s behavior to Hadden, who allegedly discouraged her from filing a complaint.  “Everyone trusted him so I told myself I needed to trust him, too,” Rood Bedford said in her victim impact statement. Now she said, “I constantly ask myself: Did I have the power to stop him?”  Since Nassar’s abuse went public in 2016, many victims have alleged that MSU and USA Gymnastics employees failed to comply with mandatory reporting regulations when they were told about his behavior. Olympic gymnast and Nassar abuse survivor Aly Raisman called out USA Gymnastics earlier this month in a series of tweets. “You are 100% responsible. It was mandatory to get ‘treatment’ by Nassar,” she wrote, adding, “The system has to change so that athletes are safe. Enablers need to be held accountable.”  </p>
<p> Six of Nassar’s accusers recently told HuffPost that they don’t believe MSU and USA Gymnastics have faced sufficient punishment for their failures.   “I’m sick of MSU trying to look good instead of be good,” said Jessica Smith, who alleges that Nassar abused her for a few months when she was 17.  MSU gymnastics coach Klages and MSU doctor Brooke Lemmen have both resigned in the face of mounting accusations. The dean of MSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, William D. Strampel, took a medical leave from his position in December. The president of USA Gymnastics, Steve Penny, resigned in March 2017 after public scrutiny of the matter.  “I think that everyone that either was reported to by victims, or that had knowledge that this was going on and didn’t do anything, should have been terminated immediately, and that’s not the case,” 18-year-old survivor Morgan McCaul told HuffPost. “I feel like this sends a big message to victims that there are no consequences for what these people did.” Head over to the Detroit News to read the full report.    </p>

<p>USA Gymnastics announced on Thursday afternoon that it’s severing ties with the organization’s national team training center, Karolyi Ranch.</p>
<p>“USA Gymnastics has terminated its agreement with the Karolyi Ranch in Huntsville, Texas,” USA Gymnastics president and CEO Kerry Perry said in a statement to HuffPost. “It will no longer serve as the USA Gymnastics National Team Training Center.”</p>
<p>Karolyi Ranch, which has served as USA Gymnastics’ national team training center since 2001, has been the home of many elite American gymnasts including Aly Raisman, Maggie Nichols and Simone Biles. All three gymnasts, and several others, say former team doctor Larry Nassar sexually abused them at the training center. More than 140 women have accused Nassar of sexually abusing them under the guise of medical treatment over two decades.</p>
<p>“It has been my intent to terminate this agreement since I began as president and CEO in December,” Perry said. “Our most important priority is our athletes, and their training environment must reflect this. We are committed to a culture that empowers and supports our athletes.”</p>
<p>She added that USA Gymnastics has canceled next week’s training camp for the women’s national team. </p>
<p>“We are exploring alternative sites to host training activities and camps until a permanent location is determined,” Perry said. “We thank all those in the gymnastics community assisting in these efforts.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Karolyi Ranch could not be reached by HuffPost for comment.</p>
<p>A statement posted to the training center’s website reads: “After nearly four decades of spiriting young gymnasts towards greatness in sport, our yearly tradition of the Karolyi’s Gymnastics Camp has come to an end. Bela, Martha, and the rest of the camp staff wish to sincerely thank all participants, USA Gymnastics, and everyone who has been a part of our extended family for 35 years of unforgettable memories. ” </p>
<p>Earlier this week, Biles revealed that she was sexually abused by Nassar while she was training at the Karolyi Ranch. </p>
<p>“It is impossibly difficult to relive these experiences and it breaks my heart even more to think that as I work towards my dream of competing in Tokyo 2020, I will have to continually return to the same training facility where I was abused,” 20-year-old Biles wrote on Twitter. </p>
<p>Olympic team member Aly Raisman has continued to call out USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee for failing to properly address the Nassar abuse. </p>
<p>“To see [Simone] write that about having to go back to the ranch ... I hope USA Gymnastics listens, because they haven’t listened to us so far,” Raisman told ESPN in an interview on Tuesday. “I hope they listen and I hope they don’t make any of the girls go back to the ranch. No one should have to go back there after so many of us were abused there.” </p>
<p> A sentencing hearing for Nassar began this week after he pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct in November 2017. The hearing was originally set to feature around 80 victim impact statements from survivors and family members. Now, over 100 people are reading impact statements and, according to Judge Rosemarie Aquilina, sentencing won’t conclude until next week. Nassar is already serving a 60-year sentence on child pornography charges. </p>

<p>Washington State quarterback Tyler Hilinski, 21, was found dead Tuesday night in Pullman, Wash.</p>
<p>Hilinski died from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his apartment. The Pullman police department issued a statement confirming his death and said that there was a suicide note near his body.</p>
<p>“Pullman Police detectives and the Whitman County Coroner’s Office are conducting a thorough investigation to confirm the suspected cause and manner of death,” the statement read in part.</p>
<p>The police went to his apartment to do a welfare check after the redshirt sophomore failed to show up for practice earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Hilinski was a backup for the Cougars but started the team’s bowl game against Michigan State last month. He completed 39 of 50 passes for 272 yards with two touchdowns and one interception in a 42-17 loss.</p>
<p>Hilinski was widely expected to be the starter heading into the 2018 season after ending last year 130 of 179 (72.6 percent) for 1,176 yards with seven TD passes and seven interceptions.</p>
<p>Washington State University president Kirk H. Schulz tweeted, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the Hilinski family”</p>
<p>A native of Claremont, Calif., Hilinski went to Upland High School in southern California before spending three years in Pullman.</p>

<p>A coach who sent more than 100 girls to Larry Nassar for medical treatment told the former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University team doctor to “go to hell” in court Wednesday.</p>
<p>Thomas Brennan, a former gymnastics coach, attended Nassar’s second day of sentencing in East Lansing, Michigan. Nassar abused many of the young women Brennan coached.</p>
<p>Brennan stood next to a gymnast he used to coach, Gwen Anderson, as she gave an emotional victim impact statement in court. </p>
<p>“I am a middle school teacher and I teach kids,” said Anderson, who decided at the last minute to break her anonymity and read her statement herself. “Every single day I am reminded how young and defenseless we were when Larry Nassar assaulted us. ... We were just kids.”</p>
<p>Nassar, 54, has sat through dozens of victim impact statements since Tuesday morning, often times openly weeping. During Anderson’s statement, however, Nassar didn’t seem to be listening as he scribbled notes in a notebook.</p>
<p>“Look at her!” Brennan yelled at Nassar during the young survivor’s statement. </p>
<p>After Anderson finished, Brennan looked Nassar directly in the face and said, “For the record, go to hell.” When Judge Rosemarie Aquilina asked if Brennan would like to add anything, the former gymnastics coach stepped up to the mic. </p>
<p>“I’ve probably sent well over 100 kids to him over the years. So the guilt I feel for that is hard to fathom,” said Brennan, who is currently an exercise physiologist. “He didn’t only deceive these girls ― which is, honest to God, that’s the worst of the worst is what he did to these girls. ... But what you did to everybody else who trusted you and sent girls your way is disgusting, reprehensible, unforgivable.”</p>
<p>Brennan thanked Aquilina for letting him speak, and added that “it’s more about her,” gesturing to Anderson. </p>
<p>Aquilina, who has spoken after every survivor’s impact statement, reminded Brennan that the “blame lies solely with the defendant.” </p>
<p>Nearly 100 victims and family members are slated to give impact statements this week during Nassar’s sentencing hearing on 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct. The former physician is already serving a 60-year sentence on child pornography charges. </p>

<p>Here’s a distraction the New England Patriots may not need as they prepare to face the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday in the AFC Championship: Their newly acquired linebacker, James Harrison, posted a photo Tuesday of an AK-47-style gun that appears to be customized for him.</p>
<p>“That new Deebo Draco,” Harrison wrote of the semi-automatic firearm, which bears his uniform number, 92, and the brand logo for his “Deebo” nickname.</p>
<p>Neither Harrison nor the Patriots immediately responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.</p>
<p>Harrison’s affection for guns has been chronicled before. The hard-hitting veteran star, who was acquired by the Patriots in December after he was cut by the Pittsburgh Steelers, once told Men’s Journal that the best way to stop campus shootings is to arm all teachers and students. A photo of a shirtless Harrison posing with two guns topped the article.</p>
<p>“It is a ridiculous image for kids to see,” ESPN wrote in 2011 of the picture. </p>
<p>Harrison admitted to police in March 2008 that he broke down a bedroom door, slapped his girlfriend in the face and broke her cellphone during an argument, but charges were dropped when he entered a counseling program.</p>
<p>Harrison’s photo of the Draco invited backlash (and some admirers).</p>
<p>“This is not necessary!!” one Instagram user wrote. “What kind of example you’re setting?!..Smh”</p>
<p>“Dumbass glorifying guns,” another said.</p>
<p>One responder referenced the Second Amendment’s right to bear arms. “This is the musket the founders had in mind right? SMH” </p>
<p>“Sad. You need a gun for what? Don’t agree with you here,” another commenter said.</p>

<p>USA Gymnastics said Wednesday it will not seek to penalize Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney for breaking a confidentiality agreement to speak out against former team doctor Larry Nassar, an admitted sexual predator whose sentencing hearing began this week. </p>
<p>The organization “will not seek any money” from Maroney if she speaks in court during Nassar’s hearing, USA Gymnastics spokeswoman Leslie King told HuffPost in a statement Wednesday. A 2016 confidentiality agreement with USA Gymnastics exposes Maroney to fines if she publicly speaks about Nassar’s abuse.</p>
<p>“USA Gymnastics has not sought and will not seek any money from McKayla Maroney for her brave statements made in describing her victimization and abuse by Larry Nassar, nor for any victim impact statements she wants to make to Larry Nassar at this hearing or at any subsequent hearings related to his sentencing,” King said. “This has been her right and USA Gymnastics encourages McKayla and anyone who has been abused to speak out. USA Gymnastics remains focused on our highest priority ― the safety, health and well-being of our athletes and creating a culture that empowers and supports them.”</p>
<p>Maroney tweeted in October that Nassar began abusing her when she was 13 under the guise of medical treatment. More than 140 women have now accused Nassar of serial sexual abuse, including Olympians Gabby Douglas, Aly Raisman and, this week, Simone Biles. </p>
<p>A sentencing hearing for Nassar began this week on 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct. The hearing is set to feature impact statements from 98 victims and family members. Nassar is already serving a 60-year sentence on child pornography charges. </p>
<p>Maroney signed a confidentiality agreement with USA Gymnastics in December 2016 as part of a $1.25 million settlement that requires her to keep her allegations against Nassar quiet. Her tweet, as well as an impact statement at Nassar’s sentencing, potentially violate the agreement.</p>
<p>Model Chrissy Teigen stepped forward on Tuesday, tweeting that she would be “absolutely honored” to pay any fines Maroney faces for speaking out against Nassar. </p>
<p>Maroney, in a statement through her attorneys, said she was overwhelmed by the offer. </p>
<p>“I’m shocked by your generosity, and I just want you to know how much hope your words bring to all of us!” Maroney said. “I just can’t get over the fact that someone I don’t personally know is sticking up for me, let alone a strong woman that I’ve looked up to for years.” </p>

<p>Gymnast Simone Biles has come forward with allegations of sexual assault against Larry Nassar, the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University who has been accused of abusing more than 140 women.</p>
<p>Biles, a 5-time Olympic medalist who helped vault the U.S. team to supremacy in Rio de Janeiro two years ago, said Monday that she was a victim of Nassar’s yearslong campaign of assault.</p>
<p>“I too am one of the many survivors that was sexually abused by Larry Nassar,” Biles wrote in a message posted to Twitter. “Please believe me when I say it was a lot harder to first speak those words out loud than it is now to put them on paper. There are many reasons that I have been reluctant to share my story, but I know now it is not my fault.”</p>
<p>USA Gymnastics responded to Biles’ statement late Monday evening.</p>
<p>“USA Gymnastics is absolutely heartbroken, sorry and angry that Simone Biles or any of our athletes have been harmed by the horrific acts of Larry Nassar,” the organization told HuffPost. “USA Gymnastics’ support is unwavering for Simone and all athletes who courageously came forward to share their experiences. We are our athletes’ advocates. USA Gymnastics will continue to listen to our athletes and our members in our efforts of creating a culture of empowerment with a relentless focus on athlete safety every single day.”</p>
<p>Biles joins several other high-profile Olympians, including Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, and McKayla Maroney, who say Nassar used his position to abuse them under the guise of medical treatment.</p>
<p>Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct in November and will be sentenced on Jan. 16. Several of the charges each carry sentences of up to life in prison.</p>
<p>Dozens of other women have also come forward with allegations against Nassar, but some worry that their own experiences of abuse are going relatively unnoticed.</p>
<p>“A lot of people seem to believe it’s only Olympians that this [abuse] happened to, which isn’t true,” Alexis Alvarado, another abuse survivor, told HuffPost’s Alanna Vagianos.</p>
<p>Biles’ fellow gymnasts, including Raisman, shared words of support after she posted Monday’s message.</p>
<p>“I am so proud of you. You are incredible Simone,” Raisman said, while once again calling for an investigation into USA Gymnastics. Raisman said earlier on Monday that she would not attend Nassar’s sentencing because it would be too traumatic.</p>
<p>Biles said it was “impossibly difficult to relive” her abuse. She added that she would work toward competing in the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, but worried about returning to “the same training facility where I was abused.” She also called for an inquiry into Nassar’s decades of abuse.</p>
<p>“We need to know why this was able to take place for so long and to so many of us,” she said. “We need to make sure something like this never happens again.”</p>

<p>Sunday night’s game between the Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints ended in remarkable fashion after Vikings receiver Stefon Diggs ran a last-second touchdown into the end zone, sending his team to the NFC Championship.</p>
<p>Vikings fans around the country erupted in chaos and exaltation after the catch, which gave Minnesota the 29-24 victory as Diggs threw his helmet into the air and cheering teammates quickly surrounded him. The Vikings will face the Philadelphia Eagles next Sunday, and the winning team will head to the Super Bowl next month in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The Vikings quickly launched a hashtag, #MinneapolisMiracle, soliciting reactions from fans. Some videos show viewers appearing to fall over during the final moments of the game, and one man’s Apple Watch reportedly sent him a heart rate warning after his BPM skyrocketed.</p>
<p>But the Vikings victory was extraordinary for one fan in particular—one older than the entire National Football Association itself.</p>

<p>Larry Nassar, the disgraced former Michigan State University and USA Gymnastics team doctor, has been accused of sexual abuse by 140 women. That’s nearly as many victims as the Jerry Sandusky, Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein scandals combined.</p>
<p>Yet Nassar’s name is not dominating national news. It doesn’t have people protesting outside his home. It hasn’t become a punchline for every late-night television host.</p>
<p>Days before his sentencing on Jan. 16, many of Nassar’s victims are wondering the same question: Why does no one seem to care about their story? </p>
<p>“I remember when the Penn State scandal was talked about at length for months and months and even years. This is nearly five times the size and no one knows about it,” sexual abuse survivor Morgan McCaul told HuffPost. </p>
<p>A dancer and first-year college student, McCaul is one of the dozens of plaintiffs anonymously named in lawsuits against Nassar, MSU and USA Gymnastics. The 18-year-old said that Nassar began sexually abusing her when she was just 12 years old in 2012. The abuse continued for three years.</p>
<p>McCaul described how she’s repeatedly had to explain to professors why she needs to miss class or an exam because of an upcoming court date. Often times, she said, they have no idea about the Nassar case. </p>
<p>“It’s been hard to reckon with, especially because these are people that I expect to be educated,” said McCaul, who attends the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, which is only an hour away from MSU. “Even people that are teaching at universities don’t know that this went on.” </p>
<p>‘I Haven’t Sensed The Outrage’</p>
<p>HuffPost spoke with six survivors who are suing Nassar, MSU and/or USA Gymnastics: McCaul, Alexis Alvarado, Jessica Smith, Christine Harrison, Larissa Boyce (who have all come out publicly since the lawsuits were filed) and “Jane Doe” (who wants to remain anonymous). All six women ― three gymnasts, two dancers and a soccer player ― shared a similar sentiment, that the country doesn’t seem to care what happened to them. </p>
<p>“I haven’t sensed the outrage,” said Boyce, who alleges that Nassar began abusing her when she was 16 and continued from 1997 to 2001.</p>
<p>Alvarado believes the country has essentially ignored the trauma inflicted on her and the other women because they’re not famous athletes. The 19-year-old said that Nassar sexually abused her for six years starting when she was 12.</p>
<p>“A lot of people seem to believe it’s only Olympians that this [abuse] happened to, which isn’t true,” she said. </p>
<p>Alvarado has a point. Although the Nassar scandal has rocked MSU and the surrounding community of East Lansing (thanks to stellar reporting from local news outlets), it seems the only times that Nassar’s name made national news were when Olympians ― including gymnasts Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney ― came forward with accusations.</p>
<p>Other survivors believe their stories haven’t made front-page headlines because they’re female athletes.</p>
<p>“I think it plays into the importance that we put on male athletics versus female athletics,” McCaul said. “This is a case of gymnasts and dancers and figure skaters, not football players or basketball players. I think it’s sexism, to be honest. There’s no other explanation for why this many women have come forward and it’s not big news.”</p>
<p>Smith, who said that Nassar abused her for a few months when she was 17, also sees a connection between the identities of Nassar’s victims and the lack of public attention. </p>
<p>“It’s hard to feel like, if I was an Olympic gymnast, maybe this would be different. If I was a football player at MSU or a basketball player at MSU, then maybe the public and MSU as an institution would care more,” she said.</p>
<p>Decades Of Abuse By A Trusted Doctor</p>
<p>Nassar, 54, sexually abused young athletes ― many of whom were top-tier gymnasts and dancers ― for decades under the guise of medical treatment. According to court documents, he gained the trust of girls and their families, which then gave him cover as he used his exams to fondle and digitally penetrate the girls in the vagina and anus.</p>
<p>He treated many of these athletes for years during his tenures as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics, the doctor for various MSU sports teams and the sports medicine doctor at the Michigan gymnastics training gym Twistars. </p>
<p>The first allegation against Nassar came out publicly in September 2016, a year before the explosive rise of the #MeToo movement. He had already been let go by USA Gymnastics in 2015 and was subsequently fired from his faculty position at MSU. In December 2016, he was arrested for possessing at least 37,000 images of child pornography, and in July 2017, he pleaded guilty to three federal counts relating to child pornography. He was sentenced to 60 years in prison this December.</p>
<p>In November, Nassar also pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct and is awaiting sentencing for those crimes. He said in a statement to the court that he’s “so horribly sorry” for what he did and he hopes the victims and the community can heal. </p>
<p>Nassar faces a minimum sentence of 25 years in prison for the sexual misconduct counts. The Michigan attorney general’s office has reportedly asked the judge to sentence him to 40 to 125 years.</p>
<p>‘Sick Of MSU Trying To Look Good Instead Of Be Good’</p>
<p>It’s safe to say that Nassar has been condemned as a sexual abuser by both the law and public opinion, and will likely die in prison. But what about the institutions that enabled his crimes to go on for so long?</p>
<p>Many of Nassar’s victims say they told parents, coaches, MSU trainers and even police what was happening behind closed doors. Time and time again, the girls’ claims were allegedly disregarded or swept under the rug. </p>
<p>“I’m sick of MSU trying to look good instead of be good,” Smith said.</p>
<p>Multiple university employees allegedly did not comply with mandatory reporting regulations when they were told about the abuse. MSU doctor Brooke Lemmen and MSU gymnastics coach Kathie Klages have both resigned in the face of mounting accusations. The dean of MSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, William D. Strampel, took a medical leave from his position in December. The president of USA Gymnastics, Steve Penny, resigned in March 2017 after public scrutiny of the matter.</p>
<p>None of them, Smith and the other women who spoke to HuffPost believe, have faced sufficient punishment for their failures. </p>
<p>“I think that everyone that either was reported to by victims, or that had knowledge that this was going on and didn’t do anything, should have been terminated immediately, and that’s not the case,” McCaul said. “I feel like that sends a big message to victims that there are no consequences for what these people did.” </p>
<p>Boyce knows all too well the consequences of people in power not following mandatory reporting regulations. She said that she told Klages about Nassar’s behavior in 1997 and that the coach told her she must have misunderstood the medical procedure. At 16, Boyce was so ashamed and confused that she continued seeing Nassar for years, during which time he kept abusing her.</p>
<p>Klages did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.</p>
<p>“It seems like MSU, USAG, and Twistars only see us as a financial burden that needs to be silenced and squashed, devalued and discredited all while trying to say they are sorry it happened to us and are on our side,” Boyce said. “They are denying any responsibility, saying they didn’t know a predator was among them. That is like a slap in the face to the seven girls who over the past 20 years told multiple MSU employees and [they] did nothing about it. How is that not showing their complete negligence?” </p>
<p>The university’s response to the allegations has made an already grueling process that much more difficult, Harrison said.</p>
<p>“It’s insulting as a victim to have to beg for answers as to why Nassar was enabled for as long as he was,” she said. “MSU did not take ownership of what they let go on. ... The enablers should be charged and a thorough investigation should be set in motion, but we have yet to see any of those actions put in motion.” </p>
<p>MSU has denied covering up Nassar’s behavior in any way.</p>
<p>“Any suggestion that the university covered up Nassar’s horrific conduct is simply false,” MSU spokesperson Jason Cody told HuffPost earlier this month. “Nassar preyed on his victims, changing their lives in terrible ways. As [MSU] President Simon has said, MSU is truly sorry for the abuse all victims suffered, the pain it caused, and the pain it still causes.”</p>
<p>MSU and Twistars filed separate motions on Friday to dismiss the lawsuits against their organizations. USA Gymnastics filed a similar motion last month, citing the statute of limitations.</p>
<p>“Nassar’s conduct is disgusting, and USAG deplores Nassar’s crimes. But Nassar, not USAG, is liable for Nassar’s criminal actions,” USA Gymnastics attorney Andrew Portinga wrote in court documents.</p>
<p>‘We Aren’t Just Jane Does ― We Are Individuals With Feelings’</p>
<p>McCaul and dozens of other Nassar victims plan to read impact statements at his sentencing hearing, which starts on Tuesday. In McCaul’s impact statement, she grapples with her dream of becoming a doctor.</p>
<p>“I am studying pre-medicine, and I sometimes question whether or not I still believe physicians can be good people,” she writes. </p>
<p>All six women who spoke to HuffPost talked about how hard it’s been to come forward with their stories. More than one described the experience as an “emotional roller coaster.” Many plan to use their impact statements to discuss the after-effects of Nassar’s abuse: depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, extreme migraines, panic attacks, stomach issues, shame, insomnia, nightmares, suicidal thoughts ― the list goes on and on. </p>
<p>All of them agreed, however, that they’ve found solace and comfort in one other.</p>
<p>Harrison said she hopes the public understands that behind every Jane Doe in these lawsuits, there is a young woman working through years of trauma. </p>
<p>“The abuse that happened to us survivors is something that will affect us for the rest of our lives,” Harrison said. “I came forward to share my story and identity because others need to know we aren’t just Jane Does ― we are individuals with feelings.” </p>
<p>Now a dance teacher, Smith said that back in November she looked around at her students ― many of whom are young girls ― and realized she had to come forward with her story. The day her accusations went public, a 7-year-old student gave her a card decorated in glitter and hearts that read, “You’re my hero.” </p>
<p>“I just looked at her and held back tears, and she was beaming smiling,” Smith said. “She had no idea how her small gesture gave me so much assurance.”</p>

<p>Aly Raisman just called out USA Gymnastics for victim-blaming the 120-plus women who have accused former team doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse. </p>
<p>In a series of tweets on Wednesday, the Olympic gold medalist wrote that USA Gymnastics is “100 percent responsible” for Nassar’s rampant sexual abuse, and called for an investigation into the organization.</p>
<p>″@USAGym STOP VICTIM SHAMING,” Raisman wrote. “Your statements are hurtful. If you did not believe that I & others were abused than why pressure & manipulate us? WE WERE MOLESTED BY A MONSTER U ENABLED 2 THRIVE FOR DECADES. You are 100% responsible. It was mandatory to get ‘treatment’ by Nassar.” </p>
<p>Raisman seems to be referring to USA Gymnastics’ most recent statement in which the organization responds to top-tier gymnast Maggie Nichols’ new allegations that Nassar sexually abused her while treating a back injury. In the statement, USA Gymnastics denied that the organization covered up Nassar’s abuse, and applauded Nichols for coming forward. But it says Nichols and a second athlete “did not provide reasonable suspicion that sexual abuse had occurred.”</p>
<p>Raisman said USA Gymnastics should have done much more to protect athletes from the now-imprisoned serial predator. </p>
<p> “We must understand how this happened to make sure it never occurs again,” she tweeted. ”... The system has to change so that athletes are safe. Enablers need to be held accountable.”  </p>
<p>Raisman, along with Olympians Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney, have alleged that Nassar abused them for years under the guise of treatment. </p>
<p>"‘Treatment sessions’ with him always made me feel tense and uncomfortable,” Raisman wrote in her book Fierce. “I would grit my teeth trying to convince myself that all this was part of the healing process. The truth was he never made my injuries feel any better, but I always obeyed because he had a reputation for being the best doctor.”</p>
<p>All of Nassar’s victims claim that he abused them during routine medical exams; some say they were as young as 12 at the time.</p>
<p>Nassar, 54, pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct in November and is awaiting sentencing. He was sentenced to 60 years in prison in December for possessing child pornography. </p>
<p>Sentencing on the sexual misconduct charges is scheduled for Jan. 16, when victims will be allowed to read impact statements. </p>

<p>The Major League Baseball Players Association is reportedly investigating an agent for allegedly filming his clients while they were showering.</p>
<p>Jason Wood was fired Wednesday from his position as president of baseball for Career Sports Entertainment, which specializes in representing athletes and sports media personalities. The termination came after an unidentified baseball player showering at Wood’s home found a camera, according to the news site FanRag Sports.</p>
<p>The player reportedly confronted Wood and then fired him as his agent. Multiple sources told the sports news outlet that Wood filmed clients in the shower.</p>
<p>No names for the alleged victims have been released, but Wood’s clients include Andrew Benintendi of the Boston Red Sox, Riley Pint of the Colorado Rockies and Joey Wentz of the Atlanta Braves.</p>
<p>Danny Martoe, president of CSE Talent, released a statement after Wood was fired:</p>
<p> For over 32 years, CSE Talent has prided itself on our moral and ethical standards and have built a solid reputation within the industry. We take pride in working with people who represent these values. It’s unfortunate that CSE Talent aligned itself with someone who didn’t uphold these same standards and therefore we chose to terminate with cause Wood’s employment. </p>
<p>The MLB Players Association hasn’t publicly commented on Wood, but confirmed to ESPN that he is being investigated. The New York Daily News reported that he has been suspended by the union pending that inquiry.</p>
<p>HuffPost reached out to Wood, who did not immediately respond.</p>

<p>DENVER ― If Terrell Davis were stuck on a deserted island with an NFL quarterback and the two of them had to hatch an escape plan, he’d want it to be Russell Wilson.</p>
<p>But first he’d need to know a little more about how he ended up stranded on a deserted island with an elite QB in the first place:</p>
<p>“Why would I be escaping a deserted island with a quarterback?”</p>
<p> “What’s my escape route? We flying off? We on a boat?”</p>
<p>In the end, the 2017 Pro Football Hall of Fame inductee, two-time Super Bowl champion, three-time Pro Bowler and historically great former Broncos running back said he’d have to go with Wilson because “he’s mobile” and “there’s all sorts of situations he’s able to get himself out of.”</p>
<p>Davis, 45, talked about that, player safety, anthem protests and more in an interview with HuffPost on Thursday morning. Davis was speaking to reporters as part of a promotional push for Verizon’s new rewards program, VerizonUp. (Note: Verizon owns HuffPost’s parent company, Oath.) The interview has been lightly edited for clarity and transcribed below:</p>
<p>HuffPost: Let’s say tomorrow you wake up, and you’ve been named NFL commissioner, with the absolute power to change anything in the league. What’s the first thing you’d do? </p>
<p>Davis: I would go back to giving teams more time to practice. More time for padded practices, more time to develop players. They’ve really taken it away from the players ― and a lot of that has been done by the NFL Players Association ― but it’s kind of cheating the players in their development.</p>
<p>Training camp is important. The way we’re preparing players coming out of college. Especially the offensive linemen and running backs, in trying to get the running game going, you need actual practice in pads. It’s hard to really get that running game going when you’re just doing simulated drills or you’re doing walk-throughs. I know what it meant to me to get those reps in, and I’m sure it would benefit a lot of other players.</p>
<p>What’s stopping NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell or the NFLPA from doing that?</p>
<p>It all comes back to players’ safety, and I think the one thing that hurts it is you have some coaches who abuse it, and that’s why they installed it initially. You had some coaches who were practicing super long ― two practices a day with pads on. I’m not sure how you could bring that back and try to make sure that it’s not being abused and that it’s being used properly. </p>
<p>If you could time travel, what advice would you give yourself before your first preseason game in 1995, when you were pretty sure you wouldn’t make the team?</p>
<p>Just be ready for the opportunity. When it comes, it’s going to come. I can’t tell you when, but when it comes ― be ready.</p>
<p>I know you fought through migraines in the past. Are you worried about chronic traumatic encephelopathy at all and how CTE might affect you in the future?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think you certainly have to be. This sport is relatively new, and we’re just now starting to see players getting older, getting their brains examined and having signs of CTE, so why would I think that I’m in the clear?</p>
<p>There are things that have happened in my life where I might forget something, and, of course, my first thought is, “Is this from playing football or am I getting older?” And I’m not sure. I have a wife and three kids, and you’re always concerned about your health. Are you going to be around when they get older? Yeah, I think about it.</p>
<p>I do know that [when I played] 18 years ago, I thought I wouldn’t let my kids play football. I’ve changed my tune for a number of reasons: One, the sport has changed and the awareness is there. If you get dinged and you see stars, you now have to go through the proper protocol, so I like what they’re doing with that. Going back to the grassroots, people growing up playing football are taught differently. The equipment is better. Techniques are being taught differently in terms of where your head should be placed. They don’t hit as much on all levels. Everything they’ve done to decrease the chances of head collisions I’ve been happy with. </p>
<p>Both of my sons play flag football, and they want to play tackle. And when it’s time to play tackle, I’m going to let them play.</p>
<p>What would you tell NFL players who are concerned about CTE and are looking at their future, thinking of leaving the league early?</p>
<p>The first thing to do is look at what their history is. If they have a history of concussions, then I can’t tell anybody to continue to play. It’s really an individual decision. If you don’t have a history of it and you haven’t had any concussions or signs of head trauma, I would tell them the game is safe. And it’s getting safer every day. I don’t tell players whether they should play or not, it’s just up to them.</p>
<p>If you were stuck on a deserted island with a QB who’s currently in the league and you had to escape, who would it be, and why?</p>
<p>[Laughing] Why would I be escaping a deserted island with a quarterback? Depends on how we’re getting off the island. What’s my escape route? We flying off? We on a boat?</p>
<p>Give me Russell Wilson, man. I’m a Russell fan. He’s got all the attacks. He’s mobile, he’s able to deal, there’s all sorts of situations he’s able to get himself out of. He’s a one-man showdown up there in Seattle. I like Russell.</p>
<p>You came up with your famous touchdown celebration, the Mile High salute, as a sign of respect for servicemen and women. Is there any advice you’d give players who are kneeling during the anthem in protest of racial inequality?</p>
<p>No. Those players weren’t kneeling because they don’t like the military. I stand. I also understand people who don’t want to stand for the anthem and why they’re doing it: It’s not about our military, it’s not about them not liking America. They’re just bringing attention to an issue in the communities that they come from. And I’m all for that.</p>
<p>  This is a country where we’re taught to fight for things we believe in and speak for people who don’t have a voice. I’ve spoken to a number of servicemen and women who have shared that they don’t mind ― that that’s what they fought for, for us to have that platform and to have the right to do that. So long as it’s a peaceful assembly in protest, they were all for that.  I would say, too, that the first time people were protesting it brought awareness to that. Now, the second thing is, what’s the plan after that? If you’re still kneeling and there’s no plan, then you’re just kneeling to be kneeling. If there’s not a plan behind it after the first couple of times, then that’s probably not the best course of action.  I didn’t have an issue with it, because I understood why the players were kneeling. Is it foolish to try to keep politics out of sports? I don’t think you can. I understand the NFL doesn’t want to deal with that. Former Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan had some rules with our locker room: Two things we don’t talk about, religion and politics. And I understand, because those issues get heated. But it’s woven into our culture now that when we do something, people [insert politics]. It’s part of where we are now. I’m not saying it’s foolish to try and keep it out, I think it’s almost impossible to keep it out.  Are you surprised Colin Kaepernick went unsigned? No. I’m not surprised. In this league, they don’t need everybody. They want you, but they don’t need you. Obviously the issues that were happening with him, those owners weren’t willing to take that risk. And then, not really knowing if he’s going to be a good quarterback or not. He’s better than some QBs in this league, but is it worth the risk for them? I’m not shocked he wasn’t signed. If you hadn’t ended up in football, what do you think you would have ended up doing? Oh, my goodness. I don’t know. I don’t look at life like that. I know my first move, if I’d been cut in training camp, would have been to go back to Georgia and parlay my relationships at Georgia with alumni and maybe work in Atlanta somewhere. Maybe that would’ve been my first move, but other than that, I have no idea what my life would’ve turned out to be. Are you concerned at all with the drop in NFL TV viewership? I’m not. Maybe there’s a few reasons why that happened. NFL viewership has gone up every year, and at some point it corrects. And it may have plateaued this year, may have even shrunk a little bit, but I think that’s OK. It’s such a big industry, and the fan base the NFL has is tremendous. Now ― next year, if it happens again, I think the league be saying, “OK, what’s going on now?” But I think it’s going to go up again this year.  What is the future of Thursday Night Football? It seems like it’s hated by players and fans. Do you see it going away? I don’t see it going away anytime soon. There’s too much money the league is making on Thursday Night Football, and I know some of the players hate it, but... There’s not enough groundswell and enough people pushing back against Thursday Night Football for it to just go away. I don’t see that happening.   </p>

<p>Gymnast Maggie Nichols alleged Tuesday that she was among the young women sexually abused by former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University doctor Larry Nassar. </p>
<p>In a statement released by Nichols’ attorney, the former elite gymnast alleged that Nassar sexually abused her “numerous times,” starting when she was 15 years old. </p>
<p>“Recently, three of my friends and former National Team members who medaled at the 2012 Olympics have bravely stepped forward to proclaim they were sexually assaulted by USA Gymnastics Team physician Dr. Larry Nassar,” Nichols said in the statement, obtained by Time magazine. “Today I join them.”</p>
<p>Nichols said she was the first victim to alert USA Gymnastics of Nassar’s abuse in 2015, which subsequently led to his arrest in 2016. She wrote that she was discussing Nassar’s treatment with a teammate during practice one day when a coach overheard.</p>
<p>“I had never told my coach about these treatments,” Nichols said. “After hearing our conversation she asked me more questions about it and said it doesn’t seem right ... so she did the right thing and reported this abuse to the USA Gymnastics staff.” </p>
<p>Nassar has been accused of serial sexual abuse by over 125 young women, including elite gymnasts Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney. All of the victims claim that Nassar abused them during routine medical exams; some say they were as young as 12 at the time of the alleged abuse. </p>
<p>The disgraced physician pleaded guilty to 10 counts of first-degree sexual misconduct in November and is awaiting sentencing. The 54-year-old was sentenced to 60 years in prison in December for possessing child pornography. </p>
<p>Nichols began competing as a top-tier gymnast when she was 13 and made the U.S. Women’s National team at 14. She retired in 2016 after failing to make the 2016 Olympic team due to injury. </p>
<p>The 20-year-old revealed that she is one of the dozens of unidentified plaintiffs currently suing USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University. </p>
<p>“Up until now, I was identified as Athlete A by USA gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University,” she said. “I want everyone to know that he did not do this to Athlete A, he did it to Maggie Nichols.” </p>
<p>The alleged abuse began in 2015 when Nichols joined the national team and began having back problems. </p>
<p> When I was 15 I started to have back problems while at a National Team Camp at the Karolyi Ranch. My back was really hurting me, I couldn’t even really bend down, and I remember he took me into the training room, closed the door and closed the blinds. At the time I thought this was kind of weird but figured it must be okay. I thought he probably didn’t want to distract the other girls and I trusted him. I trusted what he was doing at first, but then he started touching me in places I really didn’t think he should. He didn’t have gloves on and he didn’t tell me what he was doing. There was no one else in the room and I accepted what he was doing because I was told by adults that he was the best doctor and he could help relieve my pain. </p>
<p>Nichols also said that during the time the alleged sexual abuse took place, Nassar contacted her on Facebook and complimented on her looks. </p>
<p>“I was only 15 and I just thought he was trying to be nice to me,” she said. “Now I believe this was part of the grooming process I recently learned about.”</p>
<p>She plans to submit her statement to an Ingham County, Michigan, court during sentencing for Nassar on Jan. 16, ESPN reports. Victims will be allowed to read impact statements on that date. </p>
<p>Nichols said that neither USA Gymnastics nor the U.S. Olympic Committee provided a “safe environment” for her and her teammates. She also said that Michigan State University “ignored complaints against Larry Nassar ... going back 20 years.” If the school had acted on these complaints, Nichols wrote, she “would never have been abused by him.” </p>
<p>“We were subjected to Dr. Nassar at every National Team Camp, which occurred monthly at the Karolyi Ranch [in Huntsville, Texas]. His job was to care for our health and treat our injuries,” Nichols said. “Instead, he violated our innocence.”</p>
<p>Nassar’s attorneys, Matthew Newburg and Shannon Smith, declined to comment to HuffPost.</p>
<p>MSU spokesperson Jason Cody told HuffPost that the university denies allegations that it covered up Nassar’s behavior in any way. </p>
<p>“Any suggestion that the university covered up Nassar’s horrific conduct is simply false. Nassar preyed on his victims, changing their lives in terrible ways,” Cody said. “As [MSU] President Simon has said, MSU is truly sorry for the abuse all victims suffered, the pain it caused, and the pain it still causes.”</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for USA Gymnastics also denied allegations that the organization covered up Nassar’s behavior in a lengthy statement to HuffPost. </p>
<p>“Contrary to reported accusations, USA Gymnastics never attempted to hide Nassar’s misconduct,” the statement read, in part. It also laid out a timeline of the FBI’s investigation into Nassar.</p>
<p>“The suggestion by plaintiff’s counsel John Manly, who indicates that he is representing Maggie, that USA Gymnastics tried to silence athletes or keep the investigation secret to avoid headlines before the Rio Olympics and to protect Los Angeles’ Olympic bid is entirely baseless. USA Gymnastics kept the matter confidential because of the FBI’s directive not to interfere with the investigation.”</p>
<p>The spokeswoman added that “USA Gymnastics is committed every day to ensuring our athletes are safe and further developing a culture of empowerment.”</p>
<p>“The new CEO Kerry Perry is eager to meet and talk with Maggie and others who can help guide and lead these efforts,” the statement read. “USA Gymnastics has and will continue to take specific and concrete steps to prevent future abuse by vigorously enforcing the USA Gymnastics Safe Sport Policy. We are focused on further developing a culture that has safe sport as a top priority throughout the organization.”</p>

<p>Alabama defensive back Kyriq McDonald was carted off the field on a stretcher after collapsing on the sidelines during Monday night’s CFP National Championship Game against Georgia.</p>
<p>McDonald, who has not seen playing time for the Crimson Tide, appeared to be awake and alert as he was taken off the field.</p>
<p>The freshman from Madison, Ala. fell near the end of the third quarter as Alabama was trying to mount a comeback from a 13-0 halftime deficit.</p>

<p>True freshman Tua Tagovailoa hit DeVonta Smith with a 41-yard touchdown pass in overtime early Tuesday morning, giving Alabama a dramatic 26-23 win over Georgia in the championship game of the College Football Playoff at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.</p>
<p>“The resiliency of this team to come through in the second half ... I’m so proud of our players to come back after the first half we played wasn’t very good,” Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban said.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs (13-2) got the ball first in overtime and took a three-point lead on a 51-yard field goal by Rodrigo Blankenship. After Tagovailoa was sacked for a 16-yard loss on first down, he found Smith wide open down the left side for the play that turned him into an instant legend in Alabama.</p>
<p>Alabama forced overtime when Tagovailoa hit Calvin Ridley for a 7-yard touchdown pass on a 4th-down play with 3:49 remaining, capping its rally from a 13-point halftime deficit.</p>
<p>The Crimson Tide had a chance to win it at the end of regulation, but Andy Pappanastos pulled a 36-yard field goal try wide left as time expired. It was his first miss in 14 career attempts of 36 yards or shorter.</p>
<p>Blankenship finished 14- and 13-play drives with 41 and 27-yard field goals for a 6-0 Georgia lead with 7:33 left in the second quarter. The Bulldogs made it a 13-0 game at halftime when wide receiver Mecole Hardman took a direct snap and scored on a 1-yard run with seven seconds remaining.</p>
<p>Saban told his quarterbacks at halftime that he was going make the switch from Jalen Hurts to Tagovailoa and see how that impacted the offense.</p>
<p>“I just thought we needed to throw the ball in the game, and I thought he could do it better,” Saban said of the true freshman out of Hawaii.</p>
<p>Tagovailoa had seen only mop-up duty through the course of the regular season until being thrown into the spotlight in the national title game.</p>
<p>“I found out when we were in the locker room,” Tagovailoa said. “Coach brought the quarterbacks together and made the statement that, ’Tua, you’re going to start the second half and we’re going to rotate the quarterbacks ... see how things go. And we went from there.”</p>
<p>The move to Tagovailoa paid dividends on his second possession. He led a seven-play, 56-yard drive that ended with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Henry Ruggs with 8:52 left in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Georgia responded exactly two minutes later with a stunning score. Freshman Jake Fromm heaved a bomb down the right sideline for Hardman, who made the catch, eluded a tackle and tight-roped 80 yards to the end zone for a 20-7 advantage.</p>
<p>Pappanastos brought Alabama within 20-13 with 43 and 30-yard field goals, giving Tagovailoa the chance to play the hero’s role.</p>
<p>Tagovailoa started the second half and completed 14 of 24 passes for 166 yards and three touchdowns with an interception. Fromm was 16 of 32 for 232 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions.</p>
<p>It was the sixth national championship for Saban, tying him with Bear Bryant for the most in the bowl era. This one denied the Bulldogs their first national title since 1980.</p>
<p>“It’s not just about winning a championship,” Saban said. “Every team wants to be successful and as a coach, you want to see them reach their full potential. But as a college coach, and the thing that I like about college coaching, you have an opportunity to affect people.</p>
<p>“The message to the team tonight after this game? ’I hope that you take something from this game, and the resiliency that you showed in this game, and it helps you be more successful in life. So, it’s not just about winning a championship.”</p>
<p>Georgia coach Kirby Smart, a former assistant under Saban, said he expected the Crimson Tide to make a switch at quarterback coming out of halftime.</p>
<p>“We’d seen him on tape,” Smart said. “We told everyone at halftime that there was no question that they were going to him. Because they were struggling and they needed some momentum.</p>
<p>“He provided them some juice, and got them some momentum. He’s a good player.”</p>
<p>Hurts was engaged on the sideline throughout the second half, talking with coaches and encouraging Tagovailoa.</p>
<p>“He was going to step in and do his thing,” Hurts said when asked what his thoughts were when Saban told him of the quarterback change at halftime. “We have a lot of guys in the QB room that play really well. He stepped in and did his thing ... did his thing for the team. He’s built for stuff like this, he has that impact. I’m so happy for him and so happy for this team.</p>

<p>While many Alabama players will remember the Crimson Tide’s 26-23 national title game victory over Georgia as the pinnacle of a glorious season, center Bradley Bozeman may have a different recollection.</p>
<p>The senior used the occasion to propose to girlfriend Nikki Hegstetter just moments after the overtime triumph at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. He took a knee, presented the ring, and the rest is college football history.</p>

<p>A photographer covering the College Football National Championship game got a little too close to the action on Monday night.</p>
<p>Footage from the game shows the as-yet-unnamed photographer stepping into the end zone moments after Alabama’s DeVonta Smith caught the game-winning touchdown. As the Crimson Tide players rushed in to celebrate the 26-23 overtime victory over the Georgia Bulldogs, the photographer found himself right in the path of 6′4″ 246-pound sophomore tight end Irv Smith Jr. </p>
<p>Ouch. </p>
<p>It’s not clear if the photographer was injured, but viewers certainly noticed the hit: </p>

<p>Marcus Mariota of the Tennessee Titans just made the play of a lifetime. </p>
<p>The star quarterback shocked Arrowhead Stadium during the wild-card game against the Kansas City Chiefs on Saturday when he threw a touchdown pass from the Chief’s six-yard line – to himself.</p>
<p>At the start of the third-and-goal play, Mariota scrambled to find an open receiver and, when he failed to find one, booked it towards the end zone before throwing the ball.</p>
<p>But when the Chiefs’ Darrelle Revis tipped the ball, sending it back the other direction, Mariota caught it and slid into the end zone.</p>
<p>It marked Mariota’s first post-season touchdown pass.</p>
<p>Call it luck, good timing or impressive agility, but the bizarre touchdown was crucial as the Titans were down by 18 points in the third quarter. The Titans were able to turn the game around and beat the Chiefs 22-21.</p>
<p>“I just got lucky there,” Mariota told ESPN of the rare pass to himself. “I was trying to make a play, trying to give [receiver] Corey [Davis] a chance ... Revis batted it up in the air and made a good play, and I was just kind of in the right place at the right time.”</p>
<p>The Mariota-to-Mariota touchdown is only the second time in NFL history that a quarterback has thrown to himself for a touchdown, according to the New York Times.</p>
<p>The first time occurred when Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brad Johnson threw, then caught a deflected ball and ran it to the end zone during a game against the Carolina Panthers in 1997.</p>
<p>CORRECTION: The headline in a previous version of this story misspelled Marcus Mariota’s first name.</p>

<p>In an ironic twist, Tom Brady’s zealous longevity regimen ― and the acolyte who sells it ― could be what ultimately does him in.</p>
<p>That’s if you believe a riveting new account from ESPN, which pulls the curtain back on a New England Patriots organization said to be quietly grappling with infighting and power struggles between its most visible, and most valuable, members.</p>
<p>Here’s the short version: Tom Brady is deeply involved with Alex Guerrero, a personal health trainer known for his unconventional (and outright questionable) advice.</p>
<p>A New York Times profile in 2015 referred to Guerrero as Brady’s “spiritual guide, counselor, pal, nutrition adviser, trainer, massage therapist and family member.” Boston Magazine has a slightly different take, portraying him as a modern-day snake oil salesman who’d had repeated troubles with regulators until he found the ultimate sucker in Tom Brady, who’s now his business partner.</p>
<p>That relationship has eroded the power of head coach Bill Belichick, so much so that earlier this year Patriots owner Robert Kraft ordered Belichick to trade away Jimmy Garapollo, the franchise’s quarterback of the future, in a bid to pacify Brady.</p>
<p>It’s also caused a schism in the locker room, with players forced to choose between appeasing Brady by seeking treatment at Guerrero’s “TB12 Sports Therapy Center,” or sticking with team doctors ― a de facto endorsement of Belichick.</p>
<p>Now the Patriots are left with a 40-year-old, increasingly temperamental quarterback and no clear plan for succession at the position. Meanwhile, Belichick, who’d groomed Garapollo and thought highly enough of him to have (potentially) soon installed him as the team starter, is more isolated and frustrated than ever.</p>
<p>ESPN speculates that could be enough to convince Belichick to seek greener pastures elsewhere, especially as the Patriots’ offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator will likely leave the team during the offseason this year and become head coaches for other teams.</p>
<p>The Patriots denied the reports in a statement Friday, dismissing them as “theories that are unsubstantiated, highly exaggerated or flat out inaccurate.”</p>
<p>But let’s get back to Guerrero for a minute, the man whose clinic one Patriots staffer told ESPN felt “like a cult.”</p>
<p>The trainer and close associate of Brady’s used to refer to himself as “Dr. Guerrero” ― until the Federal Trade Commission came after him in 2004 for a supplement he peddled on a late-night infomercial, claiming it cured 96 percent of a group of 200 terminally ill cancer patients. And could do the same for AIDS, Parkinson’s, Multiple Sclerosis, arthritis and more!</p>
<p>The feds shut down his supplement operation, noting there was no evidence they worked, and that his degree ― a masters from a school for traditional Chinese medicine that’s since shuttered ― doesn’t grant him the title of “doctor.”</p>
<p>By 2011, Guerrero had nevertheless become a key player behind the scenes at the Patriots, where he came up with numerous other supplements of dubious merit. One, called NeuroSafe, was marketed to football players as a “seatbelt for your brain” that would help protect from “sports-related brain injury.” (The FTC investigated NeuroSafe but decided not to penalize Guerrero so long as he refunded everyone who’d bought the supplement.)</p>
<p>Backed up by Brady, Guerrero apparently gained more and more access inside the organization until Belichick cut him out of meetings in 2014, ESPN reports, ultimately banning him from the building entirely by 2016.</p>

<p>The Cleveland Browns’ unrelenting losing streak just dragged them right into the NFL history books.</p>
<p>Following their 28-24 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, the Browns joined the 2008 Detroit Lions as one of only two teams in NFL history to win zero out of 16 games played.</p>
<p>The Browns and Lions make up two of the only five NFL teams to have gone winless in an entire season since 1944. The other three teams are the 1960 Dallas Cowboys (0-11-1), the 1982 Baltimore Colts (0-8-1), and the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers (0-14). </p>
<p>“It’s very unfortunate,” Browns coach Hue Jackson said during a press conference after Sunday’s game. “Our guys played hard ... This is just what we are: We’re an 0-16 football team. I get it ... We got a lot of work to do.”</p>
<p>Browns quarterback DeShone Kizer echoed Jackson’s remarks, calling the loss “very tough.”</p>
<p>“It’s going to be tough to swallow it,” Kizer told reporters. “I believe that I’ve learned a lot about myself. I’ve learned about this game and how difficult it is to win.”</p>
<p>The day wasn’t a total loss for the Browns though. The team’s social media manager scored a touchdown with this epic reaction to the loss.</p>
<p>CORRECTION: A previous version of this article omitted the 1982 Baltimore Colts as one of five NFL teams since 1944 to have no wins in a season.</p>

<p>Detroit Pistons player Avery Bradley paid a woman to keep quiet after she accused him of sexual assault earlier this year, TMZ reported Friday.</p>
<p>The woman ― who is a reality TV star ― says Bradley assaulted her this past May after she passed out from drinking while the two were in Cleveland, Ohio. During this time, Bradley was on the Boston Celtics, who were playing the Cavaliers in Cleveland for the Eastern Conference Finals. He was traded to the Pistons in July 2017. </p>
<p>Bradley’s attorney, Brian Wolf, told TMZ his client did nothing wrong, and simply entered into the confidentiality agreement with the woman to “protect the reputation and privacy of Mr. Bradley and his family.” Wolf did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.</p>
<p>TMZ did not report the final number of the settlement, but said negotiations went as high as $400,000.</p>
<p>Confidentiality agreements are not unusual in cases of alleged sexual harassment and assault, especially in workplaces. After dozens of women came forward this year to accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment and assault, many people spoke out about how such agreements can silence victims and enable more abuse.</p>
<p>Others believe a victim should have the right to choose to enter a confidentiality agreement if that person wishes, and say they can help victims get larger monetary awards.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how Bradley’s case became public, despite his agreement.</p>

<p>I’ll make this quick and painful. Let me ask you, what is more disrespectful to the military and veterans ― a black man peacefully protesting the unjust and unlawful killing of fellow black Americans, OR a rich white man signing a tax bill that will take funding from the already depleted reserves offered to veteran assistance in order to subsidize tax cuts for private jet owners, and gut programs that help house and educate returning vets?</p>
<p>Peacefully kneeling to protest police brutality or gutting the only assistance programs for those who risked their lives to serve the country? Tough choice huh?</p>
<p>As you’d expect, the latest rendition of the GOP tax scam guts security programs such as Medicaid, CHIP and other safety nets that offer a lifeline to low income Americans. But undermining programs that help the poor represents mere collateral damage for conservatives hellbent on gifting major corporations with gigantic tax cuts, so sidestepping the fact that the tax bill they voted for will leave millions without health insurance is not an issue. But I’d like to know, what do the military-loving supporters in the GOP have to say about the cuts to veterans assistance, one of the few remaining life lines offered by the federal government to those who served, AND the cuts to programs such as Calvet? This stands for California’s Department of Veterans Affairs, which is a bond-funded program that provides veterans with home loans. It was set up in 1921 to help World War I vets and it is now in jeopardy thanks to the new bill. Meaning the GOP have such great respect for the military that they thought it was perfectly fine to defund a century-old program that could leave millions more vets at risk of becoming homeless. Shouldn’t that piss off the military loving Republicans?</p>
<p>Or what about the impact the GOP tax scam has on the G.I Bill, a bill that was expanded after Sept. 11 and signed into law by President George W. Bush. This bill covers the full cost of in-state tuition for eligible veterans who attend state schools. However, the bill only guaranteed about $22,000 toward the annual cost of private institutions, which routinely charge around $50,000 a year, so to bridge the funding gap, Congress introduced the Yellow Ribbon program, in which the government matches funds provided by the private colleges and universities toward a veteran’s tuition. However, schools’ participation in the Yellow Ribbon Plan is voluntary, and with the passing of the new GOP Tax bill, excise tax on endowments has now become law, and therefor schools are far more likely to cut back on voluntary programs like yellow ribbon, essentially gutting a vital reintegration benefit for thousands of veterans. So let me ask again, is that respecting the military? </p>
<p>You’d think those who touted their unabashed support of the military everytime Kaepernick bent his knee would be sickened at the GOP’s treatment of vets. You’d expect them to take to Twitter and type their hypocritical fingers bloody, the way they did when a black man spoke out. No. Of course they won’t. It was never about their love of the military or the vets, it was about keeping a black man in check. So next time you see any of these foul hypocrites screech about a player kneeling, ask the how their local VA is running? Ask them how the party they voted for respects the military.</p>

<p>Dec 22 (Reuters) - U.S. broadcaster Dick Enberg, who charmed sports fans with his “Oh My!” declaration as he called some of the most memorable sporting events during the last five decades, died on Thursday, ESPN reported. He was 82.</p>
<p>Enberg was found dead at his home in San Diego. His wife Barbara told the San Diego Union-Tribune that her husband failed to catch a Thursday flight to Boston, where they were supposed to meet.</p>
<p>“He was dressed with his bags packed at the door,” she said. “We think it was a heart attack.”</p>
<p>Enberg worked for NBC, CBS and ESPN, calling some of the world’s biggest sporting events, including 10 Super Bowls, 28 Wimbledons and eight NCAA men’s basketball title games, according to ESPN.</p>
<p>Enberg was born and raised in Michigan and graduated from Central Michigan University, where he began his broadcasting career, ESPN reported. He moved to California and covered the UCLA Bruins basketball team, which won eight NCAA titles during his tenure.</p>
<p>“Sportscasting is a kid’s dream come true, which is one of the reasons that I keep doing it,” he said in his autobiography, according to the Los Angeles Times. “I can’t let my dream go. I’m still love with what I do.”</p>
<p>In 1968, Enberg called what was dubbed the “The Game of the Century” between UCLA and the Houston Cougars, the first prime time NCAA regular-season game broadcast nationwide, according to ESPN. The Bruins’ 47-game winning streak came to an end that night.</p>
<p>“That was the platform from which college basketball’s popularity was sent into the stratosphere,” Enberg said about the game, ESPN reported. “That became a monumental event.”</p>
<p>Enberg was honored with awards from the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Pro Football Hall of Fame and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He also won 13 Sports Emmy Awards and a Lifetime Achievement Emmy.</p>
<p>His last job was calling San Diego Padres games, which he retired from in 2016.</p>
<p>“We are immensely saddened by the sudden and unexpected passing of legendary broadcaster Dick Enberg,” the Padres said in a statement released late on Thursday to the San Diego Union-Tribune.</p>
<p>Despite leaving the broadcast booth, he continued to work on his podcast “Sound of Success,” which last aired on Thursday with an interview of Andy Friendly, a TV producer and executive, ESPN reported.</p>
<p>“I am talking to broadcast royalty today, and I am thrilled to be doing it,” Friendly said, according to ESPN.</p>
<p>Upon hearing news of his death, friends and fans took to Twitter to pay tribute to Enberg:</p>

<p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (Reuters) - Tennis star Venus Williams will not face any criminal charges in relation to a June fatal traffic accident she was involved in near her Florida residence, the Sun-Sentinel newspaper reported on Wednesday, quoting police.</p>
<p>   The driver of a car that struck Williams’ SUV in an intersection was also not charged, after Palm Beach Gardens police determined that neither violated the right-of-way, the newspaper reported. Palm Beach Gardens police and city clerk did not immediately respond to inquiries.   </p>
<p>    Police had initially said Williams was to blame for failing to yield the right-of-way. But by July, Palm Beach Gardens police said video evidence had surfaced that showed that Williams entered the intersection lawfully, and that a car not involved in the collision forced Williams to stop in the intersection. The traffic light changed, and a sedan that struck Williams’ SUV had a green light. Jerome Barson, 78, who was a passenger in a sedan that collided with the SUV Williams was driving, died 13 days after the June 9 accident. His wife, Linda Barson, 68, was driving the sedan. The Barson family has filed a wrongful death suit against Williams. Calls to attorneys for both parties were not immediately returned on Wednesday evening.    </p>

<p>Michigan State University reportedly allowed former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar to continue working with patients in 2014 and 2015 while he was under criminal investigation for sexual assault. </p>
<p>At least a dozen women told university police investigators Nassar sexually assaulted them during the 16-month period when school police were probing an assault allegation against him, the Lansing State Journal reported Tuesday. </p>
<p>Nassar has since pleaded guilty to criminal sexual conduct and child pornography charges. More than 125 women, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney, say he sexually abused them when they were children. </p>
<p>MSU in 2014 closed a three-month investigation into a recent graduate’s claim that Nassar assaulted her, saying the woman “didn’t understand the ‘nuanced difference’ between sexual assault and an appropriate medical procedure,” according to a report in the Lansing State Journal earlier this year. </p>
<p>The school’s probe, under the Title IX gender-equity law, triggered a criminal investigation by university police. But Nassar was allowed to continue seeing patients while the probe was conducted, according to police records.</p>
<p>“It should be noted that at least twelve assaults have been reported that occurred after 7/30/2014,” says a 19-page police report obtained by the newspaper. “Many of the sexual assaults occurred in examination rooms at MSU Sports Medicine and involved the lack of a chaperone during sensitive procedures and un-gloved skin-to-skin contact.”</p>
<p>MSU spokesman Jason Cody told the Lansing State Journal the university can suspend an employee under criminal investigation, but that it didn’t suspend Nassar. </p>
<p>In response to HuffPost’s request for comment, Cody provided a detailed timeline of the 16-month investigation of Nassar:</p>
<p> On May 15, 2014, the MSU Police Department received its first report about Larry Nassar. Police immediately began a criminal investigation, and the MSU administration also immediately began a Title IX investigation.  It is important to remember, the criminal investigations conducted by MSU Police are done independently and without influence from the MSU administration. While a criminal investigation may prompt a review of an employee’s status, those processes are separate from one another. In this case, as soon as the MSU administration was aware of the allegation, we took immediate action and began a Title IX investigation. That investigation, in July 2014 and based upon the information known at that time, concluded there was no finding of a policy violation by Nassar. Thus, Nassar returned to work. On the criminal investigation, it is important to note that from the early stages, MSU Police detectives made multiple contacts with the Ingham County Prosecutor’s office. Each time, prosecutors indicated this was not a chargeable case. Despite that, a thorough investigation was completed and the report was submitted to that office for review and consideration of charges. This is consistent with the MSUPD practice of forwarding all investigations involving sexual assault to the prosecutor for review. The final decision by the prosecutor’s office was not to authorize criminal charges. </p>
<p>The university this month said it was unaware of any allegations against Nassar until Rachael Denhollander publicly came forward in September 2016. The new report contradicts that claim, revealing the school’s 2014 Title IX investigation and subsequent criminal probe.</p>
<p>“Their response has been heartbreaking because it has reminded me time and time again that our voices do not matter,” Denhollander recently said of the university’s reaction to the accusations against Nassar. </p>
<p>University President Lou Anna K. Simon said on Dec. 15 that MSU will create a $10 million fund for “counseling and mental health services as part of our commitment to support Nassar’s victims.” </p>
<p>“Nassar preyed on his victims’ dreams and ambitions, changing their lives in terrible ways,” Simon said in the announcement. “While much has been achieved, I understand that strengthening a policy or introducing a new procedure today doesn’t change what happened to these women in the past or the pain they feel.” </p>
<p>Nassar’s former boss, William Strampel, dean of the school’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, stepped down last week, citing medical reasons. </p>
<p>Nassar last month pleaded guilty to 10 counts of criminal sexual misconduct in the first degree and faces sentencing in January. He was sentenced to 60 years in prison for possessing child pornography in a separate case. </p>

<p>Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney reportedly signed a confidentiality settlement with USA Gymnastics about the alleged sexual abuse she endured at the hands of former team doctor Larry Nassar. </p>
<p>Maroney’s attorney, John Manly, filed a lawsuit Wednesday that names Nassar, USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University ― where Nassar worked as a full-time physician ― as defendants. According to a report from ESPN, USA Gymnastics allegedly approached Maroney to sign a confidentiality agreement in December 2016, when the allegations against Nassar began coming out. </p>
<p>“Confidentiality agreements in child sex abuse cases are unlawful in the state of California and have been for years,” Manly told ESPN on Wednesday. “We’re basically saying USAG and its lawyers violated the law by asking McKayla to agree to it and that she should be free to talk about her abuse to whomever she wants, whenever she wants.”</p>
<p>The amount in the confidentiality settlement was $1.25 million, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a statement to HuffPost, USA Gymnastics said that Maroney and her attorney at the time, Gloria Allred, were the ones who initiated the confidentiality agreement.</p>
<p> USA Gymnastics learned today from media reports that McKayla Maroney has filed a lawsuit against it, the United States Olympic Committee and Michigan State University related to abuse by Larry Nassar. That filing apparently seeks to nullify provisions in a prior settlement agreement between USA Gymnastics and McKayla. Contrary to reports, the concept of confidentiality was initiated by McKayla’s attorney, not USA Gymnastics. In 2016, McKayla’s attorney at the time, Gloria Allred, approached USA Gymnastics, requesting that the organization participate in a confidential mediation process. USA Gymnastics cannot speak to the mediation process, which is confidential and privileged under California law. The process culminated in a settlement agreement that included a mutual non-disclosure clause and a mutual non-disparagement clause. The settlement in 2016 was in accordance with state law, despite what has been alleged. At all times, McKayla was represented by Allred, a California-based attorney, who actively negotiated and approved the settlement agreement signed by McKayla.  Although USA Gymnastics is disappointed by today’s filing, we applaud McKayla and others who speak up against abusive behavior ― including the despicable acts of Larry Nassar. We want to work together with McKayla and others to help encourage and empower athletes to speak up against abuse. USA Gymnastics new CEO Kerry Perry is eager to speak personally with McKayla to hear her ideas on how to move the sport forward and to discuss the many safe sport enhancements that have already been implemented at USA Gymnastics. </p>
<p>Manly, who was not Maroney’s attorney when she signed the confidentiality agreement, said she entered into the agreement willingly but was traumatized and not in the right frame of mind.</p>
<p> “I want people to understand that this kid had no choice. She couldn’t function. She couldn’t work,” Manly said. “[USA Gymnastics was] willing to sacrifice the health and well-being of one of the most famous gymnasts in the world because they didn’t want the world to know they were protecting a pedophile doctor.”  Manly told ESPN that the lawsuit could expose Maroney to a countersuit from USA Gymnastics, although he said the chances of a successful countersuit are unlikely.  </p>
<p> Maroney, who is now 22, broke her confidentiality agreement this past October when she tweeted that Nassar had sexually abused her for years under the pretense of medical treatment. The tweet, which has since been deleted, described years of sexual abuse that allegedly began when Maroney was 13.   “Dr. Nassar told me that I was receiving ‘medically necessary treatment that he had been performing on patients for over 30 years,’” Maroney wrote. “It seemed whenever and wherever this man could find the chance, I was ‘treated.’” Maroney also wrote about a harrowing episode that allegedly happened when she was 15.    “For me, the scariest night of my life happened when I was 15 years old,” she wrote. “I had flown all day and night with the team to get to Tokyo. He’d given me a sleeping pill for the flight, and the next thing I know, I was all alone with him in his hotel room getting a ‘treatment.’ I thought I was going to die that night.”  Maroney has not commented publicly on the lawsuit. Earlier this month, Maroney and her mother wrote powerful victim impact statements describing the physical and emotional abuse the young gymnast allegedly endured.  “[Nassar] abused my trust, he abused my body and he left scars on my psyche that may never go away,” Maroney wrote in the letter, obtained by E! News. “Larry Nassar deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison. Not only because of what he did to me, my teammates and so many other little girls ― He needs to be behind bars so he will never prey upon another child.”   </p>
<p> Last month, Nassar pleaded guilty to 10 counts of criminal sexual misconduct in the first degree. He faces sentencing for those charges in January. In a separate case earlier this month, he was sentenced to 60 years in prison for possession of child pornography. This article has been updated to include USA Gymnastics’ statement. </p>

<p>“I believe that it is time to turn the franchise over to new ownership,” Richardson said. “Therefore, I will put the team up for sale at the conclusion of this NFL season. We will not begin the sale process, nor will we entertain any inquiries, until the very last game is played.”</p>
<p>There “has been no greater mission in my life than to have brought an NFL franchise to Charlotte,” he said. “Football has ... been an integral part of my life — and I am blessed every day that I have made the Carolinas my home.”</p>
<p>The news followed the NFL’s announcement that it was taking over the team’s internal investigation of Richardson. At least four former team workers received significant financial settlements after complaining about their treatment and signed non-disclosure agreements, according to Sports Illustrated. Complaints included sexual harassment and a racist slur directed at a black scout.</p>
<p>On “jean day” at the Panthers offices, female workers were told to stand so Richardson could check out their bodies. He would then make comments, such as: “Show me how you wiggle to get those jeans up,” the sports magazine reported.</p>
<p>Richardson was also accused of inappropriately touching women and requesting foot massages. Besides the racial slur — for which the team paid a settlement — Richardson also commented on black players’ appearance and threatened to discipline team members who addressed social issues, according to Sports Illustrated.</p>
<p>Panthers officials announced Friday that the team was conducting its own investigation. But Panthers spokesman Steven Drummond said Sunday the team requested the league take over the probe for ″transparency reasons.″</p>
<p>Richardson issued a notably tepid defense of players after Donald Trump blasted athletes in September for taking a knee during the National Anthem to protest police brutality. Richardson complained about “politicizing” the game. And head coach Ron Rivera told his team prior to the game after Trump’s comments that he expected them to “stand, look at the flag and be at attention,” rather than protest.</p>
<p>Forbes estimated in September that the team was worth $2.3 billion. Richardson and investors paid $206 million for the team in 1993, according to ESPN.</p>

<p>Sometimes motherhood can be a tough racket.</p>
<p>Serena Williams on Sunday reach out on Instagram for help to ease her 3-month-old daughter’s teething discomfort ― and the tennis star’s own stress.</p>
<p>She listed some of the remedies she’s tried for Alexis Olympia but to no avail.</p>
<p>“It’s breaking my heart,” Williams wrote.</p>
<p>Among the recommendations offered to Williams ― who sits on the board of advisers to Oath, HuffPost’s parent company ― were “baby Motrin” and “wrapping a clove of garlic in a sterile gauze and rub it on the baby’s gums 2 times a day.”</p>
<p>The Mayo Clinic advises rubbing your baby’s gums with a clean finger or applying a cold washcloth to the gums, and drying the drool to prevent skin irritation. And if the child is “especially cranky,” Tylenol or children’s Motrin “might help.”</p>
<p>But avoid medications that contain benzocaine.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, champ, you got this!</p>

<p>When it comes to what constitutes a catch in pro football, most people use a definition similar to what Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart once said about porn: We know it when we see it.</p>
<p>And Jesse James’ apparent touchdown reception to put the Pittsburgh Steelers ahead of the New England Patriots Sunday with 28 seconds left looked like a touchdown. It was ruled a touchdown on the field.</p>
<p>But NFL replay officials overruled the call, saying the pass was incomplete.</p>
<p>“We were inside of two minutes, and in order to have a completed pass, a receiver must survive going to the ground,” official Tony Corrente explained to ESPN. “In this case, he had control of the football, but he was going to the ground. As he hit the ground, the ball began to roll and rotate and the ball hit the ground, and that’s the end of it at that point.”</p>
<p>The ruling changed the outcome of the game featuring the two Super Bowl contenders. The Patriots won, 27-24. </p>
<p>The Pittsburgh faithful ― and even some non-Steelers fans ― were aghast.</p>
<p>We commend the league’s effort to NFLsplain the ruling, but ... </p>
<p>That’s probably not making Steelers fans feel any better.</p>

<p>For a few hours on Wednesday morning, a small group of Native American activists convinced the internet that Washington’s professional football franchise had finally decided to change its racist “Redskins” team name.</p>
<p>A six-person team from the Rising Hearts coalition, a D.C.-based nonprofit, launched an elaborate website that was nearly identical to the team’s page. And the site’s front page announced the good “news” that the franchise had decided to rebrand as the Redhawks. </p>
<p>“Native Leaders Celebrate a Victory as Washington Football Changes Mascot to the Redhawks,” a headline blared, in the style of The Washington Post. It and three other spoofed stories ― on sites that looked like those of ESPN, Sports Illustrated and Bleacher Report ― circulated across Twitter and other social media platforms to applause from those who have spent years calling on the team to change its name. Even the URLs mimicked the real thing, with only minor changes (the ersatz Post story, for instance, was on washpostsports.com, while the paper’s real sports page is at washingtonpost.com/sports).</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for the internet to realize the whole thing was a fake, and that the team and owner Dan Snyder, who has pledged to “NEVER” abandon the name, had not done so.</p>
<p>But that was precisely the point, said Sebastian Medina-Tayac, a Rising Hearts activist, Washington, D.C., native and member of the Piscataway tribe. </p>
<p>“It’s a tactic called a culture jam,” Medina-Tayac said. “What you’re trying to do is take up space in the online world through these grassroots tactics. They have millions of dollars to spend on PR, run social media, and have air time on TV. This is just a small moment ― about three hours on a Wednesday morning, where we were able to take up space to remind people what this was really about.”</p>
<p>“It’s not about honor and courage and bravery, and our honorable history or whatever,” he said. “It’s about a racist name that a racist person doesn’t want to change.”</p>
<p>In the past, Snyder has pushed back against claims that the name is racist, arguing that it “represents honor, represents respect, represents pride, hopefully winning.” He did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rising Hearts’ campaign took months to plan and execute, Medina-Tayac said. </p>
<p>Native American activists have fought to change the “Redskins” name for decades, and the fight intensified in recent years thanks to lawsuits and high-profile campaigns against it. Pressure grew so intense on the franchise that it hired a team of Washington Republican consultants to help defend it in 2014. It was still fighting court battles to preserve it until early this year.</p>
<p>The campaigns from grassroots organizations have continued, but media and public attention have waned. Rising Hearts hoped its off-the-wall effort would renew public attention to the issue, and remind people what they had been fighting for.</p>
<p>“I was happy to see that some people were immediately calling it out as fake,” Medina-Tayac said. “That’s where the conversation really started. They were living in an imaginary space where the name had been changed. Now that they found it was fake, it renews that passion that it should change.”</p>
<p>He said they chose to rebrand the team, rather than specifically call it out as racist, to show how easy it would be to change.</p>
<p>“Our goal was to come up with a proactive message ― something that was positive,” Medina-Tayac said. “We’re not going to boo the Redskins, we’re going to cheer the Redhawks.”</p>
<p>By all indications, the campaign worked, at least in that it got people talking. Early Wednesday afternoon, the Washington franchise responded to the campaign on its official Twitter account:</p>
<p>Medina-Tayac said he was “thrilled” that a small group with little funding forced the team to respond.</p>
<p>“I just want to give my sincere thanks to the people running that social media account and the Washington football team for acknowledging our hard work over the last few months,” he said. “That is the cherry on top, that they actually had to respond.”</p>

<p>A former NFL Network employee has filed a lawsuit alleging that she endured repeated sexual harassment and abuse from co-workers, including ex-football stars Marshall Faulk, Donovan McNabb, Eric Davis and Warren Sapp.</p>
<p>The NFL Network suspended Faulk, a retired running back who is in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and fellow analysts Heath Evans and Ike Taylor after the allegations surfaced, spokesman Alex Riethmiller confirmed to HuffPost in an email. Evans and Taylor also are former players.</p>
<p>McNabb and Davis, who used to work for the NFL Network, were suspended by ESPN, their current employer. Sapp hasn’t worked for the NFL Network since 2015, when he was fired after being arrested for allegedly soliciting a prostitute. Those charges were later dropped.</p>
<p>The sexual misconduct allegations against the ex-players were detailed in an amended lawsuit filed in Los Angeles on Monday by Jami Cantor, a former wardrobe stylist at the NFL Network</p>
<p>In the complaint, first reported by Bloomberg News, Cantor accused Faulk of fondling her breasts and exposing his penis as he demanded oral sex. She said that Evans, a former fullback, sent nude pictures and made unwelcome propositions, and that Taylor, an ex-defensive back, sent her a video of him masturbating in the shower.</p>
<p>“The supervisors knew about it, the supervisors observed it,” Cantor’s lawyer, Laura Horton, said, according to The New York Times. “It was insidious in this particular environment.”</p>
<p>She alleged another man, former NFL Network executive Eric Weinberger, groped her and pushed his genitals against her. Weinberger has been suspended by his current company, The Ringer.</p>
<p>The suit alleges McNabb, a longtime NFL quarterback, sent her lewd messages and that Davis, who played 13 seasons in the NFL as a defensive back, groped her. Both men most recently have been hosting radio shows for ESPN.</p>
<p>Sapp, according to the suit, gave Cantor sex toys as Christmas gifts three years in a row and showed her nude photos of other women with whom he claimed to have had sexual relations. He also is in the NFL Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Cantor asserts that she was wrongfully terminated by the NFL Network, where she worked 10 years until her dismissal for allegedly stealing in 2016. Cantor, then 51, said she complained about the working conditions to no avail and was replaced by a woman 21 years younger than her.</p>
<p>Cantor originally filed her suit in October.</p>

<p>JOHANNESBURG ―Jailed South African track star Oscar Pistorius suffered a bruise in a fight with another inmate over the use of a phone in prison where he is serving a sentence for murdering his girlfriend, a prison spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Fellow prisoners were angered by a long phone call he made and it led to a fight, local media reported.</p>
<p>“Oscar sustained a minor bruise. It was so minor it didn’t need any form of treatment,” said Singabakho Nxumalo, a spokesman at the Department of Correctional Services. He said authorities were investigating last Wednesday’s incident.</p>
<p>Pistorius is serving 13 years and five months after the Supreme Court last month more than doubled his sentence for the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp in 2013.</p>
<p>Pistorius won six Paralympic gold medals and was known as the “Blade Runner” for his use of carbon-fiber prosthetics. He also made it to the semifinals of the 400 meters at the 2012 London Olympics.</p>

<p>How’s this for the holiday spirit?</p>
<p>British boxer Stephen Smith had his ear torn in half like a piece of paper ― and still managed to wish fans a Merry Christmas on Sunday.</p>
<p>Smith got the gift of his left ear repaired by doctors who stitched it up following his super featherweight bout against Francisco Vargas in Las Vegas on Saturday.</p>

<p>Houston Texans quarterback Tom Savage took a vicious hit during a 16-26 loss to the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, then appeared to freeze in position on the ground as his arms and hands shook. Yet within minutes, he returned to play.</p>
<p>The troubling scene was captured on camera (see above).</p>
<p>After the hit, Savage rested on the ground with his eyes closed and his bent arms twitching in what appeared to be a seizure. When team managers decided he had suffered a concussion, Savage was yanked from the game.</p>
<p>Players are supposed to go through a protocol after serious tackles to determine if they have suffered a concussion. Players with the condition are immediately removed from play because a second hit could trigger an even more devastating brain injury.</p>
<p>ESPN reported that a “neurotrauma consultant” evaluated Savage in a medical tent following the hard tackle by 49ers defensive end Elvis Dumervil. But Savage returned to the field just three minutes later.</p>
<p>After throwing two incomplete passes, T.J. Yates replaced Savage. At that point, Savage was re-evaluated and not allowed to return to play.</p>
<p>When Savage tried to return to the field, he was restrained by a team official. The team later tweeted that Savage was officially staying out with a concussion.</p>
<p>Head coach Bill O’Brien said that medical evaluators “made the determination to put him back in the game. He went back in the game and came out and they evaluated him a little bit more just because of what they saw.”</p>
<p>ESPN later reported that the NFL’s concussion protocol obviously had “major issues.” The protocol “cannot possibly be considered adequate if it allowed” Savage back into the game, reporter Kevin Seifert wrote. </p>
<p>The troubling scene occurred amid mounting evidence of devastating brain damage from tackles in NFL games. MRIs have shown that football players suffering chronic traumatic encephalopathy from repeated concussions and other batterings can face the same kind of brain deterioration that boxers experience. Such brain damage significantly impacts intelligence and behavior and has been linked to depression, memory loss, dementia, suicide and other early death.</p>
<p>Fans were furious that the team and referee on the scene allowed Savage back into the game after the hit:</p>
<p>Five Houston players have been pulled from games in the past two weeks due to concussions.</p>

<p>Seattle Seahawks defensive end Quinton Jefferson had to be restrained from climbing into the stands and confronting Jacksonville Jaguars fans who threw food at him during Sunday’s game.</p>
<p>Jefferson was on his way to the locker room after being ejected from the game for unnecessary roughness when the incident occurred. Jefferson’s ejection was one of four penalties the Seahawks racked up in the final minutes of an increasingly tense game. </p>
<p>As Jefferson neared the tunnel, an object that looked like food went flying over his head. Jefferson stopped to argue with the fans in the stands and he was almost hit in the face with another flying object that appeared to be a beverage. That’s when he began to climb the railings.</p>
<p>The Jacksonville Jaguars announced Monday that four fans deemed responsible for throwing food at Jefferson had been banned. According to USA Today, they were found to have thrown objects including popcorn, a plastic bottle and cups filled with ice and liquid, and are prohibited from attending future events at the stadium. </p>
<p>Seahawks personnel escorted Jefferson into the locker room while security dealt with the rowdy fans in the stands.</p>
<p>Following the game, Jefferson was asked if he thought climbing into the stands was a good idea. He responded by asking if it was a good idea for fans to throw a drink at a player (it’s not ― there’s precedent).</p>
<p>“Folks in the stands was throwing beer and throwing soda, whatever. I mean, I don’t know what I’m supposed to do,” Jefferson said, according to ESPN. “I’m a human just like anybody else. I’m a man just like the other man in the stands. I’m not going to let somebody disrespect me, throw a beer on me.”</p>
<p>The Jaguars defeated the Seahawks 30-24.</p>

<p>It’s Sunday, and while there are no new episodes of “Game Of Thrones” scheduled since the conclusion of season seven back in August, the Buffalo Bills’ hosting the Indianapolis Colts was pretty close.</p>
<p>Winter had arrived in Buffalo. </p>
<p>The teams adjusted to the blizzard conditions as one would expect, celebrating sacks not with choreographed dances, but rather with snowball fights.</p>
<p>The snow accumulated so much that, by the fourth quarter, the Colts had to clear the ground so their kicker Adam Vinatieri could hit the extra point.</p>
<p>Vinatieri and the Colts did complete the extra point, tying the Bills at 7, and sending the battle into overtime. The score was essentially 0-0 again, but within the hearts of the Bills burned the fire of a thousand dragons.</p>
<p>With 1:40 remaining in overtime, Bills running back LeSean McCoy broke through the Colts’ defensive wall like the flame of Viserion, giving the Bills the walk-off win. </p>
<p>This win gives the Bills a winning record of 7-6, while the Colts felt further to 3-10.</p>
<p>However, the real winners were the fans, because like “Game Of Thrones,” if you’ve survived till the end, that’s quite an accomplishment.</p>
<p>When reached for comment, the Night King shivered, saying, “Oof, those guys are nuts. ... Respect.”</p>

<p>Skier Lindsey Vonn is ready to go for gold at the upcoming 2018 Winter Olympic games in South Korea, but she won’t be there representing President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>“I hope to represent the people of the United States, not the president,” Vonn said, appearing crestfallen in an interview with CNN on Wednesday. “I take the Olympics very seriously and what they mean and what they represent, what walking under our flag means in the opening ceremony.” </p>
<p>Vonn added: “I want to represent our country well. I don’t think that there are a lot of people currently in our government that do that.”</p>
<p>The 33-year-old skier added that if she were invited to the White House after the Olympics, she would turn down the invitation. </p>
<p>“Absolutely not,” she said, smiling and shaking her head. </p>

<p>“By not going, hopefully it will inspire some change for what we tolerate in this country and what we stand for, what is accepted and what we turn a blind eye toward,” the Warriors’ Steph Curry told reporters at the time. </p>

<p>Former NFL star Warren Moon was sued for sexual harassment and sexual battery by an assistant in California who says the hall of fame quarterback made inappropriate work demands, including forcing her to share his bed on business trips.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, which was filed Monday in Orange County Superior Court and first reported on by The Washington Post, says that Moon, 61, grabbed Wendy Haskell’s crotch while she was sleeping during a trip to Seattle.</p>
<p>Haskell, 32, who was hired at Moon’s Sports 1 Marketing agency in July, also accuses Moon of drugging her during a trip to Mexico in October and then pulling off her bathing suit. Haskell claims she was demoted from her executive assistant role after she complained about Moon’s unwanted sexual advances.</p>
<p>Moon’s lawyer Daniel Fears released a statement on behalf of his client: “Warren Moon has yet to be served with the lawsuit filed by Wendy Haskell, but he is aware of the claims contained in it. Mr. Moon denies the claims by Ms. Haskell. Mr. Moon contends these claims are meritless, and he has every intention to vigorously defend himself in court.”</p>
<p>According to a copy of the lawsuit obtained by Deadspin, Haskell accuses Moon of having a “dark and twisted side.” She says Moon forced her to submit to a number of perverse arrangements, including “providing him unfettered access to the bathroom every time she showered, wearing skimpy lingerie while in the obligatory single room, obtaining prior approval for her wardrobe, and being subjected to continuous unwanted and unsolicited sexual advances.”</p>
<p>Haskell filed her lawsuit the same week that Time magazine named “The Silence Breakers” as its 2017 Person of the Year. The cover image includes Ashley Judd, Taylor Swift and former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, who have all spoken out against various forms of sexual misconduct in the past year. The cover also includes the arm of a woman whose face viewers cannot see. Her presence is meant to represent all the women and men who fear coming forward with their own stories. </p>
<p>Haskell, through her attorney, told the Post that she wanted her name to be made public, though she did not make any additional comment on the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Moon requested a leave of absence from his role as an analyst for the Seattle Seahawks’ radio broadcast. According to ESPN, Moon was in the midst of his 14th season as a Seahawks analyst.</p>

<p>Nike just launched a lightweight and breathable hijab for Muslim athletes to wear while competing. </p>
<p>The Nike Pro Hijab went on sale globally this past weekend with the tag line “sports is for everyone.” The ad campaign features American Olympic fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, Emirati figure skater Zahra Lari and German boxer Zeina Nassar. Nike revealed the hijab last winter when it was rolled out in stores in the Middle East. Now, athletes can purchase the Nike Pro Hijab around the world. </p>
<p>“It really sunk in how much my previous hijab was hindering my performance when I tried the Nike Pro Hijab,” Muhammad told Nike in a recent press release. “Suddenly, I could hear, I wasn’t as hot and it felt like my body was able to cool itself down better and faster.”</p>
<p>Nike designers worked on the hijab prototype for months asking different athletes including Lari, Nassar, weightlifter Amna Al Haddad and runner Manal Rostom to test out the hijab while competing. The hijab is available in sizes extra-small/small and medium/large. The garment is now available in select stores. It will be sold online by Nike in black and obsidian starting Thursday, but will be available in more colors come January.</p>
<p>“It’s a reminder to us Muslim women that we can achieve anything in the world,” Lari told Nike of the company’s hijab. “What Nike has done for Muslim athletes is a dream that we never thought would happen.”</p>
<p>While Nike is not the first company to create hijabs for athletes, it is the first large-scale global corporation to prioritize the needs of Muslim athletes. </p>
<p>Muhammad, who recently launched her very own hijab-wearing Barbie, told Nike she hopes this step can make sports more inclusive to people of all backgrounds.</p>
<p>“The Nike Pro Hijab will help advance the conversation around hijabs and Muslim women in sports and further make sports an inclusive space,” she said.</p>

Watt, Jose Altuve Named Sports Illustrated Sportsperson Of The Year" date="2017-12-05" authors="Ron Dicker">
<p>Their contributions struck deep in the heart of Texas ― and beyond.</p>
<p>Sports Illustrated named Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt and Houston Astros second baseman Jose Altuve as its Sportsperson of the Year on Monday for helping the city of Houston rise from the devastation of Hurricane Harvey.</p>
<p>The honor celebrates athletes for on-field and humanitarian achievements.</p>
<p>“It’s much more than just two people,” Watt told host Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show” Monday. “It’s a whole city.”</p>
<p>Watt’s 2017 season was cut short by a leg injury but his contributions to storm-ravaged Houston will long be remembered. The three-time NFL defensive player of the year raised more than $37 million for the city to rise from its devastation.</p>
<p>Stranded in a Dallas hotel room in August by the storm, Watt started a relief fund on a YouCaring.com page. “I honestly didn’t know if we could reach $200,000,” he told Fallon.</p>
<p>The 5-foot-6 Altuve, the American League MVP, played a big role in galvanizing the city in the storm’s aftermath by helping the Astros win their first World Series title.</p>
<p>“The city of Houston has treated me really good,” he told Sports Illustrated. “I felt at that time that I owed them something. So when they were having a hard time, I wanted to give something back to them.”</p>
<p>The pair will officially accept the honor Tuesday night during an awards ceremony at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center. </p>

<p>The New York Giants fired coach Ben McAdoo and General Manager Jerry Reese on Monday.</p>
<p>Under McAdoo’s leadership this year, the team has earned just two wins and 10 losses. The Giants were considered a potential Super Bowl contender at the beginning of the season.</p>
<p>Last Week, McAdoo made the controversial decision to bench two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning and play Geno Smith at quarterback instead.</p>
<p>With Smith at the helm, the Giants lost to the Raiders Sunday 17-24.</p>
<p>At a press conference following the game, McAdoo seemed to acknowledge his employment status was on rocky ground.</p>
<p>“I’m going to coach this team as long as my key card works,” McAdoo said. “Got a great group of players, coaches, great staff to work with. Want to show up ready to go tomorrow, get this thing cleaned up and move on to the next one.”</p>
<p>Steve Spagnuolo, the team’s defensive coordinator, will take over duties as head coach, and Kevin Abrams, formerly the team’s assistant general manager, has been promoted to general manager, according to NFL reporter Aditi Kinkhabwala.</p>
<p>ESPN reported the final straw for McAdoo was likely his mishandling of Manning, whom Giants owner John Mara holds in high regard. Fans and former Giants players alike were outraged by Manning’s demotion:</p>
<p>“They did my boy dirty,” former Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress tweeted afterward. “Nuff said.”</p>
<p>“I’m absolutely speechless,” added former Giants lineman David Diehl. “I’ve watched every game & have sat through this rough @Giants season & this what you do to a man who has lead this team for 210 straight games.” </p>
<p>Two anonymous players told ESPN they felt McAdoo lost the respect of the team after he seemingly failed to acknowledge his role in the Giants’ historically bad 51-17 loss to the Rams in early November.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of the guys watched the press conference after the game like a lot of guys do just to see what [McAdoo] says,” one player said. “When [McAdoo] said ‘um’ to the question ‘What did you tell the team at halftime?’ and [McAdoo] just said ‘um,’ he didn’t really have anything. Man, he didn’t really have anything for us when we came back in the locker room, too. It was just kind of like the same old, same old. You can just see guys were like ― you can just tell that nobody was kind of following it.”</p>
<p>Early reports indicate the Giants will return to Eli Manning as their starting quarterback for this Sunday’s home game against the Cowboys.</p>

<p>The admittedly cheap shot on Bills cornerback Tre’Davious White earned Gronkowski an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty ― which was not enforced because of other flags on the play ― and a possible punishment from the league office, outlets reported.

<p>On Sunday, college football’s playoff selection committee announced the schools that will compete for this year’s national title and one thing already is certain ― folks in Ohio (and perhaps some in California) are seething.</p>
<p>No. 1 seed Clemson faces off against No. 4 seed Alabama in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1. The game in New Orleans offers a familiar matchup ― the two teams competed in last two national title games, with Alabama winning in January 2016 and Clemson prevailing this past January.</p>
<p>Also on Jan. 1, No. 2 seed Oklahoma plays No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Oklahoma last was crowned the college champion in 2000, while Georgia has not won a national title since 1980 (long before the current playoff system was devised).</p>
<p>The winners of these two semi-final games will square off for the national title in Atlanta on Jan. 8.</p>
<p>While the top three selections of Clemson, Oklahoma and Georgia became obvious after all three posted wins in big games on Saturday, debate surrounded the selection of Alabama (which didn’t play on Saturday).</p>
<p>Some analysts argued that Ohio State ― which knocked off previously unbeaten Wisconsin on Saturday and was given the non-qualifying fifth spot by the playoff committee ― and even the University of Southern California (ranked eighth) were better teams this year. That argument was based on the strength of schedules for those two teams.</p>
<p>“Alabama didn’t win its division and didn’t record a win over a top-15 team,” wrote Dan Wolken of USA Today. “To put (Alabama) in over Ohio State and USC ... should require more.”</p>
<p>Since 2014, when the new playoff system was introduced, Alabama is the only team to have been selected for the tournament every year.</p>

<p>(Reuters) - Tiger Woods got off to a fast start and fired a four-under par 68 despite a pair of bogeys on the back nine as his comeback continued at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas on Friday.</p>
<p>The solid second-round effort, which included an eagle and four birdies, left the former world number one tied for fifth place at seven-under 137 in his first tournament in nearly 10 months following spinal fusion surgery.</p>
<p>With his swing of old back for the most part, Woods held the lead at the turn thanks to an eagle at the ninth and remained at or near the top until a poor drive and bogey at the last.</p>
<p>Charley Hoffman’s sizzling 63 that included 12 birdies gave him the lead at 12-under 132, three strokes ahead of Jordan Spieth (67) and Tommy Fleetwood (69).</p>

<p>The New York Giants announced Tuesday that the team would bench star quarterback Eli Manning.</p>
<p>Coach Ben McAdoo said backup quarterback Geno Smith would start in place of Manning as the team tries to revive a losing season. Manning has started in 210 consecutive regular-season games, a streak that’s second only to former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre. McAdoo also mentioned giving rookie Davis Webb an opportunity to start as the team evaluates Smith in the next five weeks, according to the team’s website. </p>
<p>Manning, who has started every game since 2004, was gracious about the decision.</p>
<p>“Coach McAdoo told me I could continue to start while Geno and Davis are given an opportunity to play,” Manning said in the team’s blog. “My feeling is that if you are going to play the other guys, play them. Starting just to keep the streak going and knowing you won’t finish the game and have a chance to win it is pointless to me, and it tarnishes the streak. Like I always have, I will be ready to play if and when I am needed. I will help Geno and Davis prepare to play as well as they possibly can.”</p>
<p>The 36-year-old was visibly emotional speaking to reporters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Giants have only two wins so far in a dismal season that has been marred by 19 player injuries, including to star wide receivers Odell Beckham Jr. and Brandon Marshall. The unexpected collapse of the team’s season have led to calls for McAdoo’s firing.</p>
<p>The head coach, addressing the decision to bench his two-time Super Bowl MVP, spoke highly of Manning and commended his work to keep the team afloat.</p>
<p>“I’ll say it again, I have the utmost respect for Eli and everything he has done for this organization throughout his career,” McAdoo said in the team’s blog. “He is the consummate professional. He doesn’t like the position we are in, and neither do any of us. Eli has had to deal with a lot this season.”</p>

<p>That’s lousy teamwork.</p>
<p>A disturbing video obtained by TMZ and published on Tuesday shows a Georgia Tech football player knocking out a teammate with one punch. </p>
<p>A spokesman for the university said the fight happened more than six months ago.</p>
<p>“Georgia Tech’s football coaching staff became aware of the incident between teammates and friends shortly after it occurred,” the school spokesman said in a statement to HuffPost. “Discipline was handled internally.”</p>
<p>In the footage above, Step Durham is shown punching fellow defensive back Lance Austin with a right hand to the face after an exchange of words in a school athletic facility before spring practice.</p>
<p>Austin immediately falls backward to the ground. Durham then attempts to pick him up.</p>
<p>In a statement to HuffPost relayed by the university, Durham apologized to Austin and for taking the dispute “to a physical level.”</p>
<p>“Lance and I have always had a brother-like relationship and brothers sometimes fight but, as I said before, the situation should have been handled in a more mature manner,” Durham said. “I’m glad that even after the incident, our friendship remains strong.”</p>
<p>Austin said the video “is not beneficial to anyone.”</p>
<p>“Step Durham apologized and we long ago put that incident behind us,” he said in a statement. “As far as I’m concerned, there’s no further need for an apology. I forgave him already and we have since played well together as teammates this season.”</p>
<p>The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported that Austin and Durham did not appear to miss playing time this past season. Georgia Tech finished with a record of 5-6 after getting crushed by rival Georgia, 38-7, on Nov. 25.</p>
<p>Both players were among the team’s top 10 tacklers.</p>

<p>Students, parents and politicians were dismayed on Sunday at reports that the University of Tennessee may hire a coach accused of witnessing former Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky abusing a child.</p>
<p>Several outlets, including ESPN, reported Sunday that the university was in talks to bring on Greg Schiano as its head football coach, sparking widespread outrage among the Tennessee Volunteers fanbase. Schiano peers accused him of witnessing Jerry Sandusky molestation of minors at Penn State University, based on court documents released last year. Schiano was an assistant coach at the school when he allegedly saw Sandusky acting inappropriately with a boy in the showers. And now many parents, students, and social media users have accused Schiano of covering up the incident.</p>
<p>Former Penn State assistant Mike McQueary testified that Schiano was aware of the molestation, according to documents obtained by the Washington Post in 2016. McQueary told the courts that another assistant coach, Tom Bradley, identified Schiano as a witness to Sandusky’s molestation. </p>
<p>“No, only that he had — I can’t remember if it was one night or one morning — but that Greg had come into [Bradley’s] office white as a ghost and said he just saw Jerry doing something to a boy in the shower,” McQueary testified. </p>
<p>Sandusky was convicted in 2012 of molesting 10 boys over the course of 15 years. </p>
<p>Schiano has denied the allegations that he had knowledge of Sandusky’s crimes. The coach has worked at Rutgers University, Ohio State University, and in the National Football League in the years since leaving Penn State. The University of Tennessee athletics department did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. </p>
<p>Tennessee Volunteers fans took to social media, expressing anger about the potential hire and students assembled on campus with signs to protest. </p>

<p>It was game, set and match to British tennis star Andy Murray when he expertly trolled President Donald Trump over Twitter on Friday.</p>
<p>Trump faced ridicule earlier in the day after he tweeted that he’d kind of rejected a non-official offer to be named Time Magazine’s “Person of the Year” for 2017.</p>
<p>Time later tweeted that Trump, who received the accolade in 2016, was “incorrect about how we choose” who receives the title and would not comment on its choice until publication — which this year falls on Dec. 6.</p>
<p>Murray took hilarious advantage of the situation to post a reworked version of Trump’s tweet:</p>
<p>Instead of claiming he’d been offered the “Person of the Year” award, however, Murray joked that the BBC had called to say he was “PROBABLY” going to be named the network’s “Sports Personality of the Year” but he’d also decided to pass. Murray was given the title in 2016.</p>

<p>The detention of LiAngelo Ball and his two UCLA basketball teammates and Trump’s tout of his role in getting them released dominated the news cycle for days.</p>
<p>But there is another issue that their detention quietly, but just as troublesomely, rammed to the surface. That is the issue of just what is a good or bad black father. Yes, black father, because no issue in the fierce debates over good and bad parenting has been stuffed with more myth, distortions and outright lies than the issue of the black family. This inevitably zeroes in on black fathers.</p>
<p>The litany of bad knocks against black fathers is legion. They are chronically absent, derelict, imprisoned, and drug, alcohol and domestic violence abusers. The astronomical number of fractured black families without a father in the home is well-known. This has been the constant source of packs of studies, reports, surveys and tongue lashing by much of the media, academics and especially conservatives who delight in blaming the absentee black father for every economic and social ill that plagues poor black communities.</p>
<p>Now there’s Ball. With the China flap, he was plopped at the center of the latest go round of scrutiny of the role of black fathers. He has had lots of defenders. And they were there long before he refused to say “thank you” to Trump for playing any role in getting his son released. He’s praised and admired by his defenders for being a strong, protective and diligent nurturer, protector, developer and commercial enricher of his son’s basketball careers. He has taken on every comer who dares denigrate, detract or cast any aspersions on his sons and family. He has done all this while caring for an ailing wife. This is exactly what a strong black father, and black male figure, should do, according to traditional American family convention. He is a living, breathing, walking refutation of the ancient stereotypes about alleged inherently irresponsible black men and black fathers.</p>
<p>Now there’s the other side. When Ball snubbed Trump for demanding thanks for intervening for his son and the other two UCLA ball players, the howls were deafening from the Ball bashers. He was branded an embarrassment and a disgrace to the simple rules of courtesy and gratitude. This touched a strong undercurrent in some circles of loathing of everything about him as a black father. He is brash, loud, obnoxious, a shameless media self-promoter and commercial scamster. The ultimate dig is that if his son thought that he could blithely waltze into several stores and pilfer some items without any thought of the consequence, don’t blame young Ball. Blame the father for drilling into him an imperium sense of entitlement. This confirmed for the critics that he was not only a bad guy but a bad father. That’s a bad black father. The worst part of this is that black men, when they commit rotten acts, are not judged as individuals, but as every black man. Ball, then, almost by default became the platinum standard for bad behaving black men.</p>
<p>That’s a lot to dump on the shoulders of Ball. After all, he didn’t make the rules of racial engagement in America. However, for better or mostly worse, he can’t escape those rules. So, what is it? Is he a good or bad black father? And what does this little drama of his time on the public stage say for black fathers? The truth is that Ball is no different than many other fathers, that’s white fathers. He’s both protective and nurturing overbearing and boorish. His whip lashing his sons to be the best at their sport is hailed. Yet, if that means turning them into prima donnas who think the rules are made for everyone but them because they are special, he is condemned. The label then of a good or bad black father then is almost meaningless in that context since in a patriarchal society men define the roles and the rules of family. And what’s boorish can also be considered caring.</p>
<p>Ball, as many men do, blurs the line between the good and bad when he repeatedly fends off all criticism of his parenting ways with his sons. His blunt retort is that he simply wants and knows what’s best for his sons and family. He’s been lambasted as bullheaded and an opportunist every time. However, the brutal reality is that he can make that claim precisely because he has been a dominating presence in his family. In the process, he’s made himself a dominating presence in the media and public discourse on the merits of fatherhood.</p>
<p>Ball will be remembered in wide circles mostly for the tit-for-tat that he had with Trump over who did what for his son and the UCLA players in China. But long before that he was remembered for being the black father who made his sons famous. Unfortunately, this came with the addendum, but at what price for he, them, and black fathers.</p>

Dorsey, ContributorS. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Senior fellow">
<p>By James M. Dorsey</p>
<p>Testimony of a star witness in a New York courtroom has revealed new allegations of Qatari wrongdoing in its successful bid for the 2022 World Cup hosting rights.</p>
<p>The allegations by Alejandro Burzaco, the former head of Argentine sports marketing company Torneos y Competencias, are likely to revive partially politically-motivated calls for Qatar to be stripped of its rights.</p>
<p>Lurking in the background of the Mr. Burzaco’s allegations is, however, the little discussed issue of the nexus of sports and politics that underlies and enables massive financial and performance corruption in sports.</p>
<p>Indicted on corruption-related charges, Mr. Burzaco, who has agreed to a plea bargain, pleaded guilty and is expected to be sentenced next May.</p>
<p>Mr. Burzaco is one of more than 40 officials, business executives and entities that have been indicted in the United States since Swiss police accompanied by FBI agents in 2015 raided a hotel in Zurich where senior FIFA members were gathered for a congress of the world soccer body.</p>
<p>Mr. Burzaco asserted that the first three defendants to stand trial in the warren of FIFA-related cases – former South American soccer confederation CONMEBOL president Juan Angel Napout and past heads of the Brazilian and Peruvian soccer federations, Juan Maria Marin and Manuel Burga – were among several senior Latin American soccer officials who had been paid tens of millions of dollars in bribes for their votes in favour of the Qatari World Cup.</p>
<p>Qatar’s sports-related financial dealings are under scrutiny on several fronts. In a separate investigation, Swiss prosecutors last month opened criminal proceedings against Qatari national Nasser al-Khelaifi, the chief executive of beIN Media Group, the Qatari state-owned Al Jazeera television network’s sports franchise, and chairman of French soccer club Paris St-Germain.</p>
<p>The proceedings involve Mr. Al-Khelaifi allegedly having bribed disgraced former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke to ensure that beIN was awarded the broadcasting rights for the 2026 and 2030 World Cups.</p>
<p>Qatar as well as Mr. Al-Khelaifi have consistently denied any wrongdoing. A renewal of the debate about withdrawing the Gulf state’s hosting rights comes, however, as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are campaigning to have it stripped of its rights as part of their almost six-month old diplomatic and economic boycott of Qatar.</p>
<p>Qatar this week urged the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar to allow their nationals to attend the World Cup despite the travel ban they imposed as part of their boycott. “We separate politics from sports,” said Hassan Al Thawadi, secretary general at Qatar’s Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, ignoring the fact that Qatar’s sports strategy is a key part of its soft power policy.</p>
<p>A top UAE security official, Lt. Gen. Dhahi Khalfan, suggested last month that the only way to resolve the Gulf crisis would be for Qatar to surrender of its World Cup hosting rights. “If the World Cup leaves Qatar, Qatar’s crisis will be over ... because the crisis is created to get away from it,” Lt. Gen. Khalfan said.</p>
<p>Leaked documents from an email account of Youssef al-Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the United States, revealed a UAE plan to undermine Qatar’s currency by manipulating the value of bonds and derivatives. If successfully executed, the plan would have allowed Qatar’s distractors to argue that the Gulf state’s financial problems called into question its ability to organize the World Cup.</p>
<p>The plan was the latest installment in a covert UAE-Qatari media and soccer war since Qatar won its hosting rights in 2010.</p>
<p>The intrinsically political nature of the debate about Qatar and the politics that drove alleged financial corruption of the Gulf state’s bid complicate any discussion of what to do if Qatari wrongdoing were legally proven.</p>
<p>It distracts from the fact that Qatar, whose bid has been at the core of multiple scandals in global and regional soccer governance, happens to be in the hot seat at a time that often politically-driven, widespread corruption in past World Cups is becoming ever more evident. In other words, what Qatar stands accused of was common practice even if Qatar was willing to do it on a much larger scale.</p>
<p>The issue of Qatar’s World Cup raises a host of questions that if addressed could contribute to a fundamentally cleaner governance of the sport. No issue is more fundamental than the question of the relationship between a sports and politics.</p>
<p>It is a relationship that sports executives, politicians and government officials deny despite the fact that it is public and recognizable. The relationship has asserted itself repeatedly in recent months with decisions on referees made on political rather than professional grounds as well as FIFA’s refusal to apply its own rules in differences between Palestinians and Israelis under the mum of a separation of sports and politics.</p>
<p>The denial has long served as cover for sports executives, politicians and officials do whatever they want. In a bizarre and contradictory sequence of events, FIFA president Gianni Infantino in June rejected involving the group in the Gulf crisis by saying that “the essential role of FIFA, as I understand it, is to deal with football and not to interfere in geopolitics.”</p>
<p>Yet, on the same day that he made his statement, Mr. Infantino waded into the Gulf crisis by removing a Qatari referee from a 2018 World Cup qualifier at the request of the UAE. FIFA, beyond declaring that the decision was taken “in view of the current geopolitical situation,” appeared to be saying by implication that a Qatari by definition of his nationality could not be an honest arbiter of a soccer match involving one of his country’s detractors.</p>
<p>A demand last week by the Egyptian Football Federation (EFA) to disbar a Qatari from refereeing Egyptian and Saudi matches during next year’s World Cup in Russia puts FIFA in a position in which it will have to decide to either opt for professionalism over politics or also disbar game officials from Qatar’s distractors– Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain – who have likewise been appointed for the tournament from refereeing politically sensitive matches.</p>
<p>FIFA’s tying itself up in knots in response to the Gulf crisis like the politics underlying corruption charges in New York cries out for putting the inextricable relationship between sports and politics on the table and developing ways to govern a relationship that is a fact of life. Legal proceedings in New York may force FIFA to clean up part of its act, they won’t resolve the underlying structural problem.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston allegedly groped a female Uber drive in March 2016, according to a report from BuzzFeed published Friday. </p>
<p>The Uber driver, referred to as “Kate” throughout the BuzzFeed article, said she had been working as a driver for two years when she picked up Winston in downtown Scottsdale, Arizona, around 2 a.m. on March 13, 2016. According to Kate, Winston was the only passenger and his friends put him in the front seat of her car. </p>
<p>Winston immediately began behaving inappropriately and shouting homophobic slurs at people on the sidewalk, Kate told BuzzFeed. Winston then asked to stop to get food. While waiting in a drive-thru line, Kate said Winston “reached over and he just grabbed [her] crotch.” She said he held his hand there for three to five seconds until she looked at him and said, “What’s up with that?”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t just creeped out. I was frozen,” Kate said. “I mean he’s an NFL quarterback and I’m 5-foot-6. I’m not prepared for that. So I completely froze.” </p>
<p>Kate, who no longer works for Uber, filed a complaint with the company right after the incident happened. Uber responded to the allegations in a statement to BuzzFeed: “The behavior the driver reported is disturbing and wrong. The rider was permanently removed from the app shortly after we learned of the incident.” (The account holder who ordered the Uber has been removed from the ride-sharing service, but it’s not clear if that account is Winston’s.) </p>
<p>Winston tweeted a statement on Friday afternoon responding to the groping allegations, calling them “false.”</p>
<p>“I believe the driver was confused as to the number of passengers in the car and who was sitting next to her,” the statement read. “The accusation is false, and given the nature of the allegation and increased awareness and consideration of these types of matters, I am addressing this false report immediately. At the time of the alleged incident, I denied the allegations to Uber, yet they still decided to suspend my account.” </p>
<p>“I am supportive of the national movement to raise awareness and develop better responses to the concerns of parties who find themselves in these types of situations, but this accusation is false,” it continued. “While I am certain that I did not make any inappropriate contact, I don’t want to engage in a battle with the driver and I regret if my demeanor or presence made her uncomfortable in any way.”</p>
<p>According to a letter obtained by BuzzFeed that was sent to Kate from Lisa Friel, the NFL’s special counsel for investigations, the NFL is looking into the accusations. </p>
<p>Winston has been in the headlines for allegations of sexual misconduct before. Winston was accused of raping a fellow student in 2012 while attending and playing football at Florida State University.

<p>The University of South Carolina women’s basketball team has no time for President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>According to ESPN, the team, which won its first NCAA championship in April, was recently invited to attend a reception at the White House along with other college teams who won titles this year. It’s customary for the president to host title-winning NCAA teams. Since 1983, every NCAA women’s basketball championship team has been invited to the White House.</p>
<p>Head coach Dawn Staley told The Associated Press in September that the team had yet to receive an invitation to the White House reception. </p>
<p>“We haven’t gotten an invitation yet, and that in itself speaks volumes,” Staley said. “We won before those other teams won their championships. I don’t know what else has to happen.”</p>
<p>Staley told ESPN on Thursday that the team did finally receive an invitation to Friday’s event, but now they have bigger fish to fry. </p>
<p>“We did hear from the White House about attending tomorrow’s event, but we will not be able to attend,” she said. “As I’ve been saying since our practices for this season started, all of our focus is on the season ahead. The only invitation we are thinking about is to the 2018 NCAA Tournament.”</p>

<p>  Three UCLA basketball players detained in China on suspicion of shoplifting arrived back in the United States on Tuesday after President Donald Trump said he had sought the help of Chinese President Xi Jinping in the case. The players landed at Los Angeles International Airport on a flight from Shanghai on Tuesday evening, their heads down. The three ― LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill ― declined to speak to throngs of reporters before boarding a bus. “What they did was unfortunate,” Trump told reporters earlier in Manila. He said the trio, who had been held since last week, could have faced long prison sentences. Trump described Xi’s response as “terrific.”  </p>
<p>  Trump had raised the issue with Xi at a dinner held during the U.S. leader’s Nov. 8-10 state visit to Beijing. “The relevant case involving three students has already been resolved according to law,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said without elaborating when asked at a regular briefing in Beijing about Trump’s discussion of the issue with Xi. The three basketball players were detained by police on Nov. 7 in the Chinese city of Hangzhou over allegations of shoplifting. They were not on the team’s return flight to the United States on Saturday. A senior White House official said the players had been given relatively light treatment due to Trump’s intervention. “It’s in large part because the president brought it up,” the official told Reuters.  </p>
<p>  The UCLA team had been in China for a game against Georgia Tech in Shanghai on Saturday, which UCLA won 63-60. The teams had traveled to Hangzhou earlier in the week to visit the headquarters of the game’s sponsor, Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. The three students, all freshmen, were taken in for questioning by police about alleged shoplifting from a Louis Vuitton store. They were released from police custody early on Wednesday and had been confined to a luxury hotel pending legal proceedings. Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott, who had not spoken with the three players, said what had occurred was a “very regrettable situation.” The Pac-12 is the college athletic conference in which UCLA participates. “I’m just glad it’s resolved and that they’re on the way home safely,” he told Reuters by telephone. Since the matter did not occur on the court, it would be up to UCLA whether the players will be punished, Scott said. UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said in a statement that the university’s Athletics and Office of Student Conduct would review the incident and determine any potential discipline. He said such proceedings would be confidential. “I want to be clear that we take seriously any violations of the law,” he said.  </p>

<p>Hopes of the embarrassed U.S. men’s national soccer team to move forward aren’t going to be helped by mistakes like this.</p>
<p>In the team’s first match since a humiliating loss to Trinidad and Tobago last month knocked it out of next summer’s World Cup, U.S. goalkeeper Ethan Horvath let a ball go between his arms and legs during a friendly against host Portugal on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Americans actually had a 1-0 lead on their European opponents, who were playing without Cristiano Ronaldo. But that evaporated with the goalie’s blunder. The game ended in a 1-1 tie.</p>
<p>Horvath was benched earlier this month by his Belgian club team Brugge. Tuesday night’s unfortunate error probably won’t help his confidence, either.</p>

<p>When you risk it all for the people, that’s patriotic.</p>
<p>Today “GQ” named Colin Kaepernick the magazine’s Citizen Of The Year. And while many triggered conservatives tossed the magazine off the roof with their Keurigs, as if any of them ever read “GQ” before, I want to tell you exactly why “GQ” is spot on ― why Colin Kaepernick is not only the citizen of the year, but a true American patriot, who risked everything to fight for the people.</p>
<p>Back in 2016, Colin Kaepernick took a stance when no athlete with his profile did. He knelt to protest the unjust killing of Black Americans by the police. He knelt to lend a voice to the voiceless when very few did. Like many Americans, he saw the deaths of Philando Castile, Terrence Crutcher, Alton Sterling, Jordan Edwards and many more, and his heart broke. And even with history the perfect case study as to what happens when a prominent black athlete speaks out against injustice, he still did it, jeopardizing everything for the cause.</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali 1967, Tommie Smith, John Carlos and Peter Norman 1968, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf 1999. Their examples all pointed to the inevitable backlash he would face. But none of that deterred his cause. He gave up his dream of playing football. A dream he had spent every waking moment working for. He gave it up for the people. As a result, the topic of police brutality is now at the forefront of every single NFL game. Whether you agree with his protest or not, this issue has reached millions more Americans thanks to one man’s bravery. That is patriotic.</p>
<p>But aside from the stance itself, let’s remind ourselves, and the mindumbingly ignorant right wingers who have deliberately tried to mischaracterize his protest and slander him personally, the lengths Kaepernick has gone to off the field to promote the cause he knelt for. First, he sought to educate the youth, recognizing the power of knowledge, which is why, as his movement gained momentum, Kaepernick prioritized educating at-risk youth about their constitutional rights when interacting with law enforcement. So while talking heads were lambasting him as a coward who hated police, Kaep was actually doing his part to ensure that at risk youth were fully informed on what they’re obligations were when/if they dealt with law enforcement. He formed Know Your Rights camp, a nonprofit that he funded out of his own wallet, that has since become a leading organization empowering oppressed communities across America. Not only does the organization provide step-by-step guidance on constitutional rights, but it also encourages children to see that, as human beings, they have the right to be happy. The right to what Kaep took a knee for - freedom, liberty and justice for all, that is not for all right now. That is patriotic.</p>
<p>Kaep has acknowledged from the beginning that any non-profit’s ability to grow and reach more people depends on donations and backing. Which is why he pledged to donate $1 million dollars to select organizations throughout America. But here is the thing ― anyone can donate money. Donations are terrific and they help a great deal. But arguably more important than his financial commitment has been the specificity of where he directs his money. He is not just throwing around dollars and hoping it inspires some sort of change. Each month he documents, with the help of his organization, exactly where the funding goes and precisely what it will be used for, down to the finest detail and dollar assigned. So while those outraged by his initial protest screamed “What about black on black crime in Chicago?” as a means to deflect attention from the systemic racism plaguing the country, around a quarter of his 300K donated so far has been assigned to groups helping at-risk youth in the city of Chicago. Again, that is pretty damn patriotic.</p>
<p>And lastly, amidst the torrent of abuse, he has never let that deter from his primary objective: leading and educating. Onslaught after onslaught, attack after attack, from journalists, colleagues and even the president, not once did he blink. Not once did he let any of the noise distract him from what he set out to do. Having met with him personally, I was struck by how humble this man is. It’s startling. How one man can remain so poised, so focused and so present up against unimaginable adversity is beyond admirable. Where many would have broken, he has stayed true to those he fights for. Think about it. Imagine the headlines if he clapped back at the manchild in chief after being called an SOB? How far down the list would the issue of police brutality fall? Pretty far, right? How many of these ‘patriots’ who describe him as a ‘ungrateful thug’ would be able to withstand the smears, the ruthless and relentless hyperbole and remain focused on their objective? Very few. But that’s why none of them are Citizen of the year. That’s why very few are real patriots.</p>

<p>The first thought I had when news broke about the alleged store thefts in China by UCLA freshman basketball player LiAngelo Ball and two teammates was not about him or them, but me. Apart from the alleged thefts happening in a foreign country and the space of decades in time, it was almost a carbon copy of the situation I faced as a star football player at a Los Angeles high school.</p>
<p>I and a couple of other football buddies were charged with theft from a local department store. We were paraded out of the store in handcuffs by four LAPD officers. At the local station, we were grilled by detectives on the alleged theft. I was given a stern warning that I would be prosecuted if I didn’t confess. I did. I was released later that evening. However, that did not end the ordeal. When I was being taken from the store in cuffs, one of the parents of one of my football teammates spotted me. She stared in disbelief as I was being led away. The next day, this was the buzz on the campus, I was called into the coach’s office. I was grilled again by the coach and the vice principal on my actions and the detention. I was threatened with suspension from the team and from class for several days. It did not go any further than the threat and a warning. There was a reason ― I was a star lineman, and was one of the leaders in number of tackles. I was just too valuable to cut loose even for one game. This less-than-a-hand slap punishment was done almost with a wink and a nod.</p>
<p>This little drama with crime, the police, school officials and the coaches reinforced an attitude that was already deeply ingrained in me and the other start performers on the team. We were special. We could pretty much do what we wanted without fear of punishment as long as we were a valued sports commodity. I rarely carried a book, let alone cracked it. I knew that all I had to do was go through the motions in the classroom, and I would be assured of passing.</p>
<p>This heavy sense of entitlement and a virtual free pass to do whatever I pleased without any real fear of repercussion or punishment was like living in fairy tale land. This total dimmed my sense of responsibility, respect for rules and the law, and ethical behavior. The athletic pedestal, I, and the others, were on didn’t dim. It obliterated our moral compass. The entitlement syndrome that I, and other top athletes, had was almost unshakeable and in far too many other cases took a huge tool on the lives of several other top athletes at the school. They also were pampered, coddled, and sheltered so long that once there playing days were over they nose-dived into a downward spiral of drugs, alcohol, domestic abuse, job loss and repeated run ins with the law.</p>
<p>It was no surprise then that Trump would intervene on behalf of the three UCLA players to secure their release. it was no surprise that Chinese authorities quickly agreed to their release. It will be no surprise if the three receive a hand slap punishment for their alleged crimes.</p>
<p>Ball is a touted athlete. His father, through his outrageous self-promotion and commercialism of his sons, has virtually insured that NCAA and UCLA officials will tread very carefully on what kind of discipline they mete out to the players. The NCAA, for its part, has been all over the map in how it punishes schools for violations of its athlete discipline rules and guidelines. It pretty much leaves the discipline game to the schools. That almost always means that player punishment for infractions is dumped back into the laps of coaches. These are the same coaches who know their big salaries, coaching tenure and future coaching prospects depend on one thing and one thing only ― how many “Ws” is on their resume. University presidents and top officials also know the importance of the bushels of dollars and prestige that a successful, well-oiled football or basketball program can bring to their institution. And don’t think the top players don’t know that there wouldn’t be much of an athletic program at a major university without their star power on the field or the court.</p>
<p>There is already a hint of a less than aggressive takedown of Ball and the other players. Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott issued the obligatory statement of regret over the action of the players, and then shut down any query about what could happen with the limp retort that, “We will continue to closely monitor the situation.” The UCLA coaches, athletic director and chancellor were even more close mouthed.</p>
<p>The bigger question for me is did the athletes get it? That entitlement from athletic stardom and grooming has a deep pitfall. One that I fell into but fortunately climbed out of. We’ll see with them.</p>

<p>James Michael Angelo was just another commuter trying to get somewhere on the New York City subway Monday.</p>
<p>Now he’s the “Can You Not?” guy. </p>
<p>Angelo, a comedian and real estate agent, earned viral fame after shoving LeBron James’s phone out of the way while the basketball superstar filmed his public transit adventure. “Can you not?” Angelo said.</p>
<p>James and his Cleveland Cavaliers teammates explained on James’ video that they opted for the underground because a bus ride would have taken too long from their morning shoot-around before their night game against the New York Knicks.</p>
<p>For many basketball fans, the players’ presence would be straphanger nirvana. But when James’ selfie-video placed Angelo in the frame next to him and he said, “I don’t know this dude right here, he trippin,’” Angelo reacted with the push and his now-famous line. Angelo told For the Win that he had asked James three times to watch his elbows and that the four-time MVP was “unaware of his space.” Angelo said he was listening to U2 on his headphones and didn’t want to be filmed.</p>
<p>In a funny video Angelo posted later to Twitter, he joked that he wanted to be referred to as “Can You Not?” from now on. He insisted he didn’t know he was in the presence of sports greatness. “I had no idea who LeBron James was because I don’t watch football,” he declared before being corrected by someone off-camera.</p>
<p>Angelo then issued a mock challenge to James: “I just want you to know that I’m coming for you.”</p>
<p>Just another day on the New York subway.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the Cavaliers defeated the Knicks, 104-101.</p>

<p>Marquise Goodwin played with the heaviest of hearts on Sunday.</p>
<p>The San Francisco 49ers receiver revealed that he and his wife, Morgan, lost their baby boy “due to some complications” in the early hours before his team’s game against the New York Giants.</p>
<p>In a devastating Instagram post with a picture of the baby’s hand holding a finger, Goodwin wrote that his wife gave birth to the boy prematurely after a difficult pregnancy. </p>
<p>“Although we are hurt, I am grateful for the experience and grateful that God blessed me with a wife as courageous and resilient as Morgan,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Goodwin took to his knees after an 83-yard touchdown reception during the 49ers’ 31-21 home victory over the New York Giants ― the team’s first win of the season ― but clearly his emotion transcended football.</p>
<p>“I have so much respect for him, to come out here and still play, with the hurt that he had in his heart, and to ball out,” 49ers safety Eric Reid told SFGate.com.</p>

<p>(Reuters) - U.S. soccer star Hope Solo accused ex-FIFA President Sepp Blatter of grabbing her buttocks during an awards ceremony five years ago, an allegation that the former head of international football’s governing body denied.</p>
<p>Solo, 36, told a Portuguese newspaper that Blatter touched her inappropriately in January 2013 during the Ballon D’or awards ceremony in Lisbon. A spokeswoman for Solo on Saturday confirmed her comments.</p>
<p>“I had Sepp Blatter grab my ass,” the former goalkeeper on the U.S. national women’s team said in an audio interview with Expresso, posted on Saturday.</p>
<p>“It was at the Ballon D’or one year, right before I went on stage,” said Solo, who received FIFA’s women’s player of the year award in 2013. “It’s been normalized.”</p>
<p>A spokesman for Blatter said in a phone interview on Saturday that Solo’s allegation was “absurd and ridiculous, and it is not true.”</p>
<p>Solo is the latest celebrity to go public with accusations of sexual misconduct by powerful men in sports and entertainment, including movie producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Kevin Spacey and former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly.</p>
<p>The high-profile allegations have inspired an online campaign, tagged #MeToo, that has encouraged men and women in all walks of life to reveal their own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, often years after they occurred.</p>
<p>Solo last month posted a statement on her Instagram page that commended women in the entertainment industry for having courage to reveal their experiences with sexual misconduct and suggested she had been a victim herself.</p>
<p>“From inappropriate comments, unwanted advances and grabs of the ass to coaches and GMs and even press officers speaking about players ‘tits’ and physical appearance, sexual harassment is rampant in the sports world,” Solo wrote online.</p>
<p>“I always felt I’d ‘handled it’ and stood up for myself in those situations, but there were never any consequences for the perpetrators,” she added.</p>
<p>Solo, considered one of the best goalkeepers in the world, played on the U.S. women’s soccer team from 2000 to 2016, when it won two Olympic gold medals and a World Cup.</p>
<p>Blatter is in the midst of a six-year ban from all soccer-related duties imposed by Zurich-based FIFA’s ethics committee after a corruption scandal.</p>

<p>Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez had the most severe case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy ever discovered in someone his age, researchers at the Boston University School of Medicine disclosed at a conference Thursday.</p>
<p>Dr. Ann McKee, the director of the school’s CTE center, said the 27-year-old’s brain was “clearly at the severe end of the spectrum” for his age group, diagnosing Hernandez with Stage 3 CTE (out of 4), which hasn’t been seen before in brains younger than 46 years old.</p>
<p>Hernandez died of an apparent suicide earlier this year while serving a life sentence for homicide. In the troubled years before his arrest, Hernandez reportedly became extremely paranoid, began regularly using PCP, and carried a gun with him at all times. </p>
<p>CTE is a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated head trauma, and is commonly diagnosed in players of high-impact sports like football and boxing.</p>
<p>The damage in particular affected Hernandez’s frontal lobes, McKee said, a region of the brain associated with decision-making, judgment and cognition. </p>
<p>Symptoms of CTE include impulse control problems, aggression, depression and paranoia, according to the Concussion Legacy Foundation.</p>
<p>McKee cautioned attendees that a CTE diagnosis alone is insufficient in explaining all of Hernandez’s behavior, but it does offer a significant clue.</p>
<p>“We can’t take the pathology and explain the behavior,” McKee said, according to commentary relayed by The Washington Post. “But we can say collectively, in our collective experience, that individuals with CTE, and CTE of this severity, have difficulty with impulse control, decision-making, inhibition of impulses for aggression, emotional volatility, rage behaviors. We know that collectively.”</p>
<p>A Boston University study of 202 brains of deceased American football players earlier this year found CTE in 87 percent of them, with the number climbing to 99 percent among NFL players.</p>
<p>“It is no longer debatable whether or not there is a problem in football; there is a problem,” McKee said in a statement at the time. ”[It] is time to come together to find solutions.” </p>

<p> The UCLA basketball team came to China as hoops ambassadors ― but now some of the players may have been swept up in an international incident. Chinese authorities arrested three UCLA team members, including celebrated freshman LiAngelo Ball, on charges of shoplifting on Tuesday in Hangzhou, according to ESPN. They were released on bail Wednesday, the sports network said, citing an unnamed source. Freshmen Cody Riley and Jalen Hill also were reportedly charged in the incident at a Louis Vuitton store next to the team hotel. The arrests came as President Donald Trump was set to arrive in China on Wednesday.  “We are aware of a situation involving UCLA student-athletes in Hangzhou, China,” the UCLA Athletics department said in a statement published by USA Today. “The university is cooperating fully with local authorities on this matter, and we have no further comment at this time.” </p>
<p> Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott issued a more pointed statement to the newspaper: “We are very disappointed by any situation that detracts from the positive student-athlete educational and cultural experience that this week is about. Whether in the United States or abroad, we expect our student-athletes to uphold the highest standards. We will continue to closely monitor the situation.” UCLA is scheduled to play Georgia Tech in Shanghai on Saturday local time. Ball, one of the Bruins’ star recruits, isn’t just well known for what he’s done on the court. His older brother, Lonzo, was a first-round draft choice who plays for the Los Angeles Lakers, and his father, LaVar Ball, is the extremely outspoken and controversial founder of Big Baller Brand. “It ain’t that big a deal,” the father was quoted as saying of the arrest.  </p>
<p> According to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, three Georgia Tech players were also questioned about shoplifting, but were cleared. </p>

<p>San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich isn’t shy about speaking his mind on matters beyond the court, whether it’s about President Donald Trump or racial inequality.</p>
<p>But after his team defeated the visiting Phoenix Suns, 112-95, Sunday night, the coach figured it wouldn’t be the right time to talk basketball, either. Not after 26 people lost their lives when a gunman opened fire on First Baptist Church in nearby Sutherland Springs, Texas.</p>
<p>And he politely but firmly told reporters so. </p>
<p>“We won a basketball game but considering what’s gone on today, it’s pretty meaningless,” he said. “When you think about the tragedy that those families are suffering, it’s just inconceivable and impossible to put your head around. So I think talking about basketball tonight is probably pretty inappropriate. You guys have a good night.”</p>
<p>One of Popovich’s players was particularly vocal in addressing the tragedy before the game. Pau Gasol, a native of Spain, said that “something has to change.”</p>
<p>“At what point do we say enough?” Gasol, a veteran center, asked, per MySanAntonio.com. “I don’t know. Again, I know it’s a delicate subject but I hate for innocent people to get killed and for families to pay that price and carry that burden for the rest of their life. It’s sad. It’s really sad. It needs to be addressed. I hope that it is. I hope we see change and progress to prevent this from happening so often.”</p>

<p>Three Miami Dolphins players went against a rule implemented by the team’s coach by kneeling in silent protest during the national anthem. </p>
<p>Safety Michael Thomas, wide receiver Kenny Stills and tight end Julius Thomas each took a knee during the anthem in Sunday’s game against the Oakland Raiders in Miami. Dolphins’ head coach Adam Gase instituted a team policy in October which told players to either stand for the anthem or stay in the tunnel leading to the field. </p>
<p>After a conversation between the players and Gase, the coach chose to respect their position and eased up on his previous policy.</p>
<p>The compromise comes just a day after the team announced that it was launching an annual fund for social justice programs. Michael Thomas hinted at the possible solution in October while discussing a meeting between the players, the players’ union, and team owners.</p>
<p>“I think it’s going to be a positive step in the right direction,” the safety told the Palm Beach Post. “It’s not the end-all solution, but it’s going to be a positive step in the right direction that we were able to actually do something.”</p>
<p>Colin Kaepernick, then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback, has been credited with starting the protests last year when he took a knee during the national anthem at a game in an effort to raise awareness for racial injustice.</p>
<p>Critics have expressed frustration with Kaepernick’s choice of protest, calling it disrespectful to the American military and the flag. President Donald Trump furthered the controversy in September when he implicitly called Kaepernick a “son of a bitch” and called on NFL fans to boycott games when kneeling occurred. </p>
<p>Team owner Stephen Ross, who was an early supporter of the protests, also expressed his wish that players would begin to stand last month. </p>
<p>“It’s a different dialogue today,” Ross said at his weekly tailgate. “Whenever you’re dealing with the flag, you’re dealing with something different. (Trump) has changed that whole paradigm of what protest is. I think it’s incumbent upon the players today, because of how the public is looking at it, is to stand and salute the flag.”</p>

<p>Shalane Flanagan became the first American to win the women’s division of the New York City Marathon since 1977.</p>
<p>Flanagan crossed the finish line on Sunday with an unofficial time of 2 hours, 26 minutes and 53 seconds, the New York Times reported. She defeated three-time defending champion Mary Keitany of Kenya, who came in second.</p>
<p>Runner Miki Gorman was the last female American to win the race in 1977.</p>
<p>Flanagan first ran the marathon in 2010 and placed second. This was her first time participating in the race since then, ABC 7 reported.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Kamworor of Kenya won the men’s division with a time of 2 hours, 10 minutes and 53 seconds. He edged Wilson Kipsang, also of Kenya, by three seconds.</p>

<p>The National Football League appears to be throwing even more weight behind those who interpret the #TakeaKnee movement protesting racial inequality as a sign of disrespect for the military.</p>
<p>The league announced on Sunday that for every use of the #SalutetoService hashtag on social media it would donate $5 to select military nonprofit groups. The campaign will benefit the USO, the Pat Tillman Foundation, which offers scholarships to veterans and their spouses, TAPS, which offers grief assistance, and the Wounded Warrior Project, which supports injured service members.</p>
<p>The #SalutetoService campaign comes in the wake of the controversy over the social justice #TakeaKnee protest.</p>
<p>Last season, former San Fransisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the national anthem as a way to call out racism in the United States.</p>
<p>Since the newest season began, many more players have engaged in the protest, galvanized by President Donald Trump’s criticism of players that kneel. During a political rally in Alabama, Trump decried the practice, saying that owners should fire players who do it. He said that owners should say, “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he’s fired. He’s fired!”</p>
<p>But the movement has shown staying power despite the controversy surrounding it. A game held late last month saw the majority of Houston Texans players taking a knee after a controversial comment from the team’s owner.</p>
<p>Last month, league commissioner Roger Goodell announced that he believes “everyone should stand” for the national anthem, citing the importance of “honor[ing] our flag and our country.” But he said that the league wouldn’t force players to stand.</p>
<p>With the #SalutetoService campaign, Goodell appears to be going a step further.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NFL players have requested a formal mediation with league leadership over the protest issue, CBS reported Sunday. The group insists that the talks include Kaepernick, who is taking legal action against the league for allegedly colluding against him. Kaepernick has remained an unsigned free agent since leaving the 49ers.</p>
<p>While the #SalutetoService campaign shows the league donating money, the NFL has received funds to demonstrate national pride in the past.</p>
<p>Between 2012 and 2015, the Department of Defense spent $6.8 million in taxpayer dollars in exchange for displays of patriotism during games, including flag ceremonies and honoring military service members.</p>
<p>A 2015 report by Arizona Republican Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake slammed the practice as “paid patriotism.” In a 2015 statement, McCain dismissed it as a cheap “marketing ploy,” saying that “fans should have confidence that their hometown heroes are being honored because of their honorable military service.” </p>
<p>Because players were generally not present on the field during the national anthem until 2009, some have suggested ― but not proven ― that the new tradition was part of the Department of Defense’s efforts. </p>

<p>Carlos Correa had a great night. </p>
<p>The Houston Astros shortstop topped his World Series victory on Wednesday with another major milestone: He proposed to girlfriend Daniella Rodriguez on live TV. </p>
<p>Correa was in the midst of a postgame interview with Fox Sports when he said he wanted to take “another big step” in his life. He then got down on one knee and asked for Rodriguez’s hand in marriage:</p>
<p>In an interview with ESPN, Correa said he wanted to propose to Rodriguez, a former Miss Texas USA, but was waiting for the right moment to pop the question on the national stage. He even hid the engagement ring in his locker at Dodger Stadium. Then, during the ninth inning of the final game, Correa asked one of the clubhouse attendants to get the ring if the Astros won.</p>
<p>The Astros won their first championship title last night after defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-1 in the seventh game of the World Series. As many commentators pointed out, Correa will walk away from the series with not one, but two rings.</p>

<p>The Cleveland Browns reached a deal with the Cincinnati Bengals to acquire quarterback AJ McCarron but failed to complete the trade because the team did not notify the league of their approval before Tuesday’s 4 p.m. deadline. </p>
<p>Apparently the Browns were too busy celebrating the trade and forgot to call in the trade, according to ESPN’s Aaron Goldhammer.</p>
<p>According to NFL.com, the teams agreed to the trade at 3:55 p.m. and while the Bengals notified the league before the deadline, the Browns did not. Instead, the Browns sent in paperwork just after the deadline and told the NFL there should be a grace period. The league did not grant the Browns a grace period.</p>
<p>It’s safe to say Browns fans had similar reactions to ESPN commentator Michael Smith, who could not hide his outrage over the botched deal. Check out the video below.</p>

<p>This post first appeared at BillMoyers.com.</p>
<p>Anyone who follows baseball, whose World Series ends this week, knows that the national pastime has changed more in the last five years than in the previous 50. It hardly seems the same game. Starting pitchers go five innings or less; they throw more curves and sliders; there are defensive shifts on almost every batter, and those batters are usually swinging for the fences, and succeeding more than ever before, or striking out when they don’t succeed; the stolen base is practically obsolete, as are, increasingly, the sacrifice bunt and the hit and run. Eventually, the ground ball may be too. This is a revolution, but it hasn’t been organic, arising from changes in the athletes. It has been imposed… by data.</p>
<p>What happened to baseball is one small example of something that has been happening for years across America. We are all now inundated by data, all of us living a data-driven life at the expense of what one might call a more human-driven one. In ways both obvious and subliminal, statistics are changing our institutions, including our politics — and they are changing us. It isn’t too much to say that they are becoming determinative.</p>
<p>Let’s start with baseball. When I was growing up and first became a fan many, many years ago, the game was something of an art. It was full of guesswork, intuition, tradition, idiosyncrasy and, of course, talent. Grizzled managers didn’t consult iPads, fielders didn’t pull cards out of their pockets for each batter to get defensive positioning, and batters didn’t watch a video of their last at-bat in the dugout — all things that managers and players routinely do now. The game was much looser than that, much more instinctive. It was all gut and nerve and hunch — a bunch of guys feeling the game. To quote the immortal Yogi Berra: “You can’t think and hit at the same time.”</p>
<p>That’s mostly gone now, so much so that when Houston Astros’ manager, AJ Hinch, sent his pitcher, Charlie Morton, out to the mound for the sixth inning Saturday night, going against the “book,” the announcers kept marveling that Hinch was “trusting what he sees,” “trusted his eyes,” rather than referring to the statistical tables that would have told him to remove the pitcher — the idea being that just about nobody trusts his eyes anymore. You trust the data.</p>
<p>This big revolution in baseball, maybe the biggest, which has spread to every other professional sport, is called “sabermetrics,” and it began back in the 1950s and then caught fire in the 1970s, when a few baseball diehards and stat nerds, most notably a former factory security guard and amateur statistician named Bill James, who has become something of a baseball deity, discovered that data was really a treasure trove if you knew how to interpret it and, more, use it.</p>
<p>James and his confreres didn’t believe in trusting their eyes. They felt that the statistics baseball generated often told a different story from the one you saw, and, more, that the traditional stats didn’t really tell you what you needed to know. Better stats could tell you who was really adding to the team’s victory total and who was detracting from it, who hit which pitcher best and which pitcher had a batter’s number, which batters were better at night and which during the day, and a thousand other things that would radically alter the practice of the game.</p>
<p>And they were so good at it, so right, that baseball team after baseball team began relying on new and sophisticated stats to determine just about everything they did. You didn’t play hunches anymore. You played the odds. Michael Lewis’ best-seller, Moneyball, and the movie based on it, told the story of how Oakland Athletics’ GM Billy Beane rebuffed the old-timers and swore by data instead of eyes for his decision-making. It’s a film in which sabermetrics is the real hero and tradition the real villain, whether we want to think of it that way or not. Nowadays, in order to be a general manager or even a manager you have to be a data freak.</p>
<p>No one, least of all me, is going to argue against statistics and scientific data. (Well, I suppose Republicans would argue against them.) The more we know, the better, and the more explanatory our data, the better. But there is nevertheless something to the quote Mark Twain attributed to British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli that there are three kinds of lies: “lies, damned lies and statistics.” It is not so much that statistics lie, or even that, as my late father, an accountant, used to say, “Figures don’t lie, but liars do figure.” And it isn’t even that statistics, taken at face value, are missing something essential, though I think they are — a human element that breathes life into them. If we didn’t have that human touch, AJ Hinch would have pulled Charlie Morton because the data shows that a pitcher is less effective the third time through the order, and Dodger manager Dave Roberts certainly wouldn’t have let Joc Pederson, a struggling hitter, bat in the ninth inning… when he hit a three-run homer.</p>
<p>The deeper danger, I think, is that statistics, as they are deployed so often now, aren’t just explanatory; they are dictatorial, meaning they impose themselves on whatever is being analyzed and tryrranize it. In baseball, for instance, the old stats — home runs, ERAs, RBIs, batting average, slugging percentage — were extrapolated from the game to give us some sense of value. We thought a player with a high batting average was a good player. Sabermetricians tell us otherwise. They use their stats not just to measure value, but to bend the game to conform to the statistics. Or put another way, they are less interested in what had happened than it what it portends.</p>
<p>Take “launch angle,” which is the hot baseball stat these days. The idea is that there is an optimum angle at which the bat strikes the ball in order to get a hit, or better yet, hit a home run. (And, yes, there is a comprehensive data set on the launch angles of just about every batted ball.) As a means of explanation, I suppose, there is some interest in knowing which players have the “best” launch angles. But that’s not what has happened when the data is mined. Instead, just about every player — and organization — has become obsessed with launch angles as a way of making sure that batters get that ball up over the wall, and they adjust accordingly. What used to be a very human endeavor — learning how to hit a ball — has become a mechanical one. It is as if data analysts were to tell a visual artist which colors to use or a writer which words work best.</p>
<p>And to what end? The end is to minimize failure, a pursuit which certainly has its place in many areas of our lives, but not in all of them. Not to get too philosophical about it, but failure is a part of being human. It is a way we grow, develop, learn and ultimately gird ourselves for the inevitable defeats we will encounter. Failure isn’t necessarily to be avoided; it is to be understood. A life without failure is a life not fully lived. A game in which failure is measured by the inability to adjust one’s launch angle is a game diminished.</p>
<p>We see this data-drive most clearly in sports, which are full of stats, but everywhere numbers crunchers are striving to find the formulas for what works and what doesn’t — which typically means, what gets us to do what someone wants us to do. This is the primary function of algorithms — formulas designed to let merchants know what we will want. Google operates on algorithms expressly designed to give us the information and the ads it has surmised we want. Facebook operates on algorithms to send us the news (and the ads) it has surmised we want. Amazon operates on algorithms to advertise books to us it has surmised we want. Netflix operates on algorithms to give us the TV programs and movies it has surmised we want. And increasingly, political organizations are searching for algorithms that will allow those organizations to give us the political positions it has surmised we want.</p>
<p>And so it goes.</p>
<p>There is a certain circularity to this: You take our data and then provide us with something customized to that data. But just as baseball statistics rob the game of some of its beautiful mess, algorithms rob us of the opportunity to be exposed to things we haven’t already endorsed. They place us within a prison of our own predetermined desires. We only get what we have wanted previously and nothing else. This is a limiting way to live. And like so much else in our culture, eg., social media, which I discussed last week, it tends to push us further within ourselves and away from others. Algorithms, like sports statistics, promise predictive success — in this case, the predictive success of being satisfied with what has always satisfied us in the past.</p>
<p>The cultural implications of living within our very own feedback loop are large. So are the political implications. Already, Americans barely extend themselves beyond their own political predispositions. We wall ourselves off from anything we don’t like. Once politicians find the political equivalent of launch angles or get the hang of creating algorithms that can push our buttons, we may lose the humanity of our political discourse too. We are clearly on that path now.</p>
<p>Maybe this is progress. Maybe this is just the direction of the world. Still, baseball, I think, used to be a better game before it got all computerized with analytics. But that’s just a game. A politics that figures out precisely how to incite us or pacify us or distract us is something else. And I am not so certain that something else is an advance.</p>

<p>LOS ANGELES, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Corey Seager’s sixth-inning sacrifice fly helped the Los Angeles Dodgers eke out a come-from-behind 3-1 Game Six victory over the Houston Astros on Tuesday to force a World Series decider.</p>
<p>Seager’s deep fly ball to right field allowed Chase Utley to scamper home for the go-ahead run, igniting the sold-out crowd of 54,128 as the Dodgers tied the series up at 3-3 to set up Wednesday’s winner-take-all showdown.</p>
<p>Dodgers center fielder Chris Taylor continued his clutch hitting in the post-season, tying the game 1-1 earlier in the inning with a double down the right-field line off of losing pitcher Justin Verlander.</p>
<p>“I was just trying to put a ball in play,” Taylor said.</p>
<p>“He’s really tough with that fastball up in the zone and a good slider. I was just trying to get the barrel on the ball and hope for something good and it worked out for me,” he said.</p>
<p>Taylor has reached base safely 26 times this post-season, a franchise record.</p>
<p>Dodgers slugger Joc Pederson hit a solo 373-foot blast in the bottom of the seventh to provide the National League champions with an insurance run, and reliever Kenley Jansen came in during the eighth inning for a drama-free six-out save.</p>
<p>The loss was the first of the post-season for the hard-throwing Verlander, who had a no-decision in Game Two.</p>
<p>Dodgers starter Rich Hill was sharp but gave up a solo home run to center fielder George Springer in the third inning for a 1-0 Astros lead and was pulled with two outs in the fourth.</p>
<p>Dodgers reliever Tony Watson, who came into the game in the top of the sixth inning and escaped a two-on-two out jam, was the winning pitcher.</p>
<p>The defensive play of the game came in the top of the seventh when the Astros had runners on first and third with two outs, and second baseman Jose Altuve hit a soft ground ball to Justin Turner.</p>
<p>The third baseman charged to pick up the ball and make a quick throw to first baseman Cody Bellinger, who took it on the hop to get the speedy Altuve and keep the Dodgers 2-1 in front.</p>
<p>Game Seven will pit the Dodgers’ Japanese right-hander Yu Darvish against Astros curve-ball specialist Lance McCullers Jr.</p>
<p>Darvish had a nightmare start in Game Three in Houston, where he could not get out of the second inning in the shortest start in his major league career.</p>
<p>McCullers Jr had a solid outing for the first five innings of the same game before losing his accuracy in the sixth inning.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s game will be the first-ever World Series Game Seven played at Dodger Stadium and will either see the hosts win a first title since 1988 or the American League champion Astros bag a first-ever crown in their 55-year history.</p>

<p>If LeBron James was going for “terrifying” with his Halloween costume this year, he nailed it.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-8, 250-pound Cleveland Cavaliers star dressed up as Pennywise the dancing clown, the villain from the Stephen King book and film, “IT,” for his annual Halloween bash. And as photographs and video from the party show, James was unrecognizable in the nightmarish getup.</p>
<p>James lived up to his character’s “dancing clown” moniker, too. Video captured at a party showed him busting moves on the dance floor. </p>
<p>James wasn’t the only member of the Cavaliers to wow with his Halloween costume.</p>
<p>J.R. Smith and his wife Jewel Smith dressed as Coneheads. According to the Plain Dealer, Kevin Love flew in a makeup artist from Los Angeles to help transform him into former WWE star Sting. Staying in theme, Love’s girlfriend Kate Bock dressed as a championship belt-toting and blond-mustachioed Hulk Hogan.</p>
<p>Dwyane Wade and his wife Gabrielle Union showed up as the 1980s R&B duo Milli Vanilli, complete with waist-length braids and Grammy awards.</p>
<p>Isaiah Thomas was the spitting image of late rapper Eazy-E.</p>
<p>Tristan Thompson and his girlfriend Khloe Kardashian pulled out all the stops for their “Game of Thrones” couple costume ― he as Khal Drogo and Kardashian as a long-tressed Daenerys Targaryen. </p>
<p>Channing Frye dressed as Blankman from the 1994 superhero parody film of the same name. </p>
<p>And in what may have been the most elaborate costume of the night, Kyle Korver (aka Willy Wonka) was photographed with his own Oompa Loompas in tow.</p>
<p>The Cavs may not be doing great on the basketball court right now, having lost four of their last five games. But if it’s any comfort, the team is definitely winning Halloween. </p>

<p>HOUSTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The Houston Astros escaped a thrilling home-run filled clash with a 13-12 extra-innings victory against Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday to be one win away from their maiden World Series title.</p>
<p>After blowing a three-run lead in the ninth inning during which they had the Dodgers down to their final strike, Houston closed out one of the wildest games in World Series history when Alex Bregman hit a walk-off single in the 10th inning.</p>
<p>“Back and forth, the two best teams in baseball fighting to the very end and going toe to toe with each other,” Bregman told reporters. “Everybody was used on both teams, pretty much, every single player. It was special for us to come out on top.”</p>
<p>Each team had their left-handed aces on the mound to start the pivotal fifth game of the best-of-seven series but both the Dodgers’ Clayton Kershaw and Astros’ Dallas Keuchel failed to produce the pitchers’ duel many had expected.</p>
<p>By the time the final out was recorded in a game that had it all and kept the capacity crowd on their feet most of the way, the Dodgers and Astros had combined for a whopping seven home runs, including a trio of three-run blasts.</p>
<p>The Astros, who lead the series 3-2, now have two chances in Los Angeles to win their first World Series championship since the inception of the franchise 55 years ago.</p>
<p>“We knew going into this series, this is the best offensive ballclub that we were going to see all year. And they can slug you. They spoil pitches. They’re athletic. And credit to them,” said Dodges manager Dave Roberts. “But our guys did the same thing. They just got the hit when they needed.”</p>
<p>After rallying back from four, three and one-run deficits, Houston finally pulled in front when Jose Altuve’s run-scoring double made it 9-8 just two batters after George Springer tied the game with a solo shot.</p>
<p>Carlos Correa’s two-run homer before the inning was over stretched the Astros lead to three but Dodgers shortstop Corey Seager doubled in a run in the top of the eighth to pull his team to within 11-9.</p>
<p>On a night when no lead was safe, the Astros fans remained a tense bunch even after Brian McCann’s eighth-inning homer gave the Astros their biggest lead of the night, 12-9.</p>
<p>But the drama was only getting started as the Dodgers stormed back in the ninth compliments of Yasiel Puig’s two-run shot and a run-scoring single from Chris Taylor before sending it to extra innings.</p>
<p>Kershaw, who enjoyed a pitching masterclass in the series opener, was locked in early but the wheels came off and by the time he left the game had allowed six runs and four hits with two strikeouts and three walks over 4-2/3 innings.</p>
<p>Keuchel also had a rough night as he loaded the bases in the first before a Logan Forsythe single scored a pair. The Dodgers added another before the frame was done and Keuchel left the game after allowing four runs on five hits through 3-2/3 innings.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to put into words all the twists and turns in that game, the emotion, doing it at home, in front of our home crowd,” said Astros manager A.J. Hinch.</p>
<p>“Just exactly what you expect to come to the park with Keuchel and Kershaw pitching. Just a perfect setup game for a bunch of runs,” he added jokingly.</p>
<p>Game Six is scheduled for Tuesday in Los Angeles where the Dodgers will send Rich Hill to the mound while the Astros will counter with Justin Verlander.</p>

<p>This spectator’s reaction to a home run looked so foul.</p>
<p>Cameras caught one Houston Astros fan snatching the ball out of another’s hands to throw it back onto the field during Game 5 of the World Series on Sunday.</p>
<p>While it is a tradition at Houston’s Minute Maid Field to toss back dingers hit by the visiting team, there seemed to be at least a boundary issue here. Besides, any World Series ball would make quite a keepsake.</p>
<p>This one, hit by the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Yasiel Puig in the ninth inning, had some additional significance, the Washington Post noted, because it broke the record for most homers in a World Series.</p>
<p>The spectators managed to keep the peace after some initial tension, despite a Twitter uproar. According to the Houston Chronicle, they’re in-laws.</p>
<p>“I just would have liked to have been able to throw it back myself,” Sarah Head, who first ended up with the ball, told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Kirk Head, who tore it away from her, said: “It’s bad karma to keep it. You’ve got to throw it back. I was just making sure she did.”</p>
<p>Here’s another look:</p>
<p>The Astros won, 13-12, in 10 innings and moved within one victory of their first World Series title.</p>

<p>The NFL Commissioner’s office said it wanted former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick to attend the second NFL owners meeting. The NFL Players Association said it wanted Kaepernick to attend the meeting. Now whether Kaepernick will attend the meeting or not is anybody’s guess. So far, Kap has done what he has done since the controversy about his anthem protest and his alleged blackballing from the League swirled, and that’s say absolutely nothing publicly about any of this. There are a lot of what ifs then over whether he’ll attend. And if he does, what he would say. However, the bigger ‘what if’ is would the NFL owners really listen and take heed of what he could say to them?</p>
<p>NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, presumably speaking on behalf of many, if not most, of owners has talked a good game about the League getting more involved in “social change issues” that impact on poor, minority communities. Goodell has met with some of the more outspoken NFL players about their concerns about combatting police abuse, mass incarceration, and racial injustices. These are the very things that Kap sat, took the knee, tweeted about, spent his own money on, and ultimately got kicked out of the League for addressing.</p>
<p>If Kap ever did get an audience with the owners he almost certainly would talk about these causes and press the owners to put their money, time, energy, and behemoth clout, behind support of. The betting odds are that some of the owners would up their efforts to do a few of these things. It wouldn’t take much for NFL teams to pump a few more dollars into education, job training programs, and mentoring programs for at risk youth, and issue a statement here and there about police abuse. These actions are the cheap and easy way for the NFL to show concern.</p>
<p>There are two big problems with all this. Goodell strongly hinted at one when he noted more than once that only a handful of NFL players have said or done anything to back Kap. That means something as simple and defiant as raising a clinched fist, sitting on the bench, or taking a knee during the playing of the anthem. Goodell doubled down on his skepticism about the protests when he pointedly noted that the fans don’t like any of this. He has heard the boos that have rained down on the players when they have locked arms during the national anthem. This not just the pique of a few hot-headed fans. Polls and surveys show that most NFL fans demand that the players just play ball and leave the politics out of the game. They are the ones who shell out tens of millions in ticks, for NFL paraphernalia, the fantasy leagues, buy products from NFL corporate sponsors, and boost the TV ratings.</p>
<p>Goodell and the owners walk a thin tight line between them and the more vociferous black players who demand that the NFL be a social change agent. The line gets even thinner when Goodell and the owners continually see tweets and hear saber rattling broadsides from Trump screaming for the League to crack down on the protests. The owners get indignant, and issue outraged statements, telling Trump to butt out. But these are the same owners who are rock solid GOP guys, have given millions to the party over the years, and that includes fattening Trump’s campaign coffers. When Trump pops off about the League, they know that he speaks for millions of NFL fans</p>
<p>The other problem is owners like Dallas Cowboy’s Owner Jerry Jones, Houston Texans’ owner Robert McNair and Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder. They aren’t just ultra conservative, hard line, outspoken opponents of any compromise with the players. They are the NFL’s Platinum Star owners. They carry a lot of weight in League decision making circles. They’re not likely to budge from their frozen in time, hard-nosed stance on the protests, let along do anything beyond the usual PR, safe cause stuff the League routinely does to allegedly show it cares about issues beyond the playing field.</p>
<p>There’s one more ace the owners and Goodell have to stall, and ultimately force the players to get back to business as usual. That’s the game itself. The players are players not activists. They make a lot of money, and they want desperately to get their teams into the playoffs. This is will be the prime focus of the players, coaches and management as the playoff race heats up. So, the owners can play for time, clamp a tight muzzle on Jones and McNair so they won’t say anything dumb that rile up the players.</p>
<p>Kap then can say what he wants about police abuse and racial injustice. The owners, including Jones and McNair, will listen politely, tell the media how “productive” this was, and then quickly get back to doing what they want to do more than anything else. That’s just play ball.</p>

<p>Houston Astros’ first baseman Yuli Gurriel has been suspended for five games next season for making a racist gesture in the dugout during Friday night’s Game 3 of the World Series.</p>
<p>Gurriel had just hit a home run off of Los Angeles Dodgers’ pitcher Yu Darvish, who is Japanese-Iranian and was born in Japan. Cameras caught Gurriel stretching the corners of his eyes with his fingers, a racist gesture against people of Asian descent.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred announced on Saturday that Gurriel would be barred from five games in 2018, the Associated Press reports.</p>
<p>Prior to Manfred’s announcement, Gurriel had apologized for the gesture as well as for using the word “Chinito,” a Spanish term that can be used as a slur against Asians, The New York Times reports.</p>
<p>“I just feel bad,” Gurriel, who is from Cuba, told the Times through a translator. “If anybody got offended over there, it was not my intention.”</p>
<p>He made similar comments to ESPN, adding that he has “a lot of respect” for Japanese people and “never had anything against” Darvish. He also characterized “chinito” as a common way in Cuba to talk about an Asian person.</p>
<p>Darvish appears to have accepted the apology. He tweeted out a statement on the incident, acknowledging that what Gurriel did was wrong, while urging the public to learn from the incident and move forward, rather than becoming angry.</p>
<p>“If we can take something from this, that is a giant step for mankind,” Darvish wrote. “Since we are living in such a wonderful world, let’s stay positive and move forward instead of focusing on anger.”</p>
<p>This story has been updated with the news that Gurriel has been suspended.</p>

<p>Thursday’s matchup was a bit of a dud, with the Baltimore Ravens pummeling the Miami Dolphins 40-0, but one rogue cat made the lopsided game worth watching.</p>
<p>As the Dolphins completed their final failed play of the game, a tabby ran onto the field and among players on the Dolphins’ sideline.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best part was commentator and former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo analyzing the cat’s run. </p>
<p>“Look at this,” he said. “Perfect form. Extension ... doesn’t even get phazed when people are around. Ooh, look at the the change of direction! Does he get both feet in here at the end?”</p>
<p>It’s unclear how the cat got onto the field, but it doesn’t seem to matter much. Viewers were smitten.</p>

<p>Furious World Cup U.S. midfielder Megan Rapinoe ripped the leadership of the world soccer administrative body as “old, male and stale” in a BBC interview Monday.</p>
<p>FIFA, the organization headquartered in Switzerland that runs the World Cup and the matches leading up to it as well as several others, “doesn’t really care” about female soccer players, Rapinoe said flatly. </p>
<p>Rapinoe spoke out to the BBC after the world body chose a little-known amateur striker from Venezuela — 18-year-old Deyna Castellanos, who also plays for Florida State University — for its female player-of-the-year shortlist. U.S. midfielder Carli Lloyd and Dutch forward Lieke Martens were also named. They both play in professional leagues. Many other top professional scorers were overlooked.</p>
<p>“The award just doesn’t hold a lot of weight when you’ve got someone on the list I’ve never heard of,” said Rapinoe, who won a gold medal at the Olympics in 2012 and played on the winning 2015 World Cup team. “If some random male player who was not even a full professional was nominated, I’m sure [FIFA] would step in for that. It’s disappointing that the same hasn’t been done for us,” she told the BBC.</p>
<p>“It signals to us and it signals to the rest of the world that FIFA doesn’t really care,” she said.</p>
<p>A FIFA statement said the choices are made by fans and coaches with a certain weighted value system. The statement said that leaders would “take this feedback on board in future editions of The Best Awards.”</p>
<p>The latest FIFA slight is one of a litany of complaints by women in soccer. U.S. female soccer stars are paid a fraction of what men are paid by U.S. Soccer, which is part of FIFA, even though the U.S. men’s team didn’t make it the World Cup this year, for the first time since 1986. The women’s team won the last World Cup in 2015. The U.S. TV audience for the matches were the biggest in U.S. soccer history.</p>
<p>U.S. women won the World Cup in 2015 playing on artificial turf, a surface that tends to cause more injuries than natural grass. Questions have also been raised about possible links between artificial turf and cancer.</p>
<p>Men have never played World Cup matches on artificial turf. The U.S. women sued to switch to real turf before the 2015 World Cup but later dropped the action because they weren’t optimistic about their chances of winning the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Rapinoe last year joined four other players who filed a wage discrimination complaint against U.S. soccer, saying they were getting 40 percent of what men were being paid. World Cup bonuses have been far more skewed. In 1998, each U.S. women’s team player got a $2,500 bonus for making the World Cup team — and winning the cup. The men each got a $20,000 bonus, even though they finished last.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, U.S. Soccer agreed to increase women’s pay, though they still won’t get pay parity with the men, The New York Times reported.</p>
<p>Rapinoe, who plays for the Seattle Reign, last year became the first professional soccer player to take a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality.</p>

<p>Halloween is more than a week away, but “Sunday Night Football” had a spooky feel to it as fog rolled into Foxboro, Massachusetts, and obscured much of the action between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons.</p>
<p>The scoreboard said the Patriots prevailed, 23-7, in the Super Bowl rematch, but it was hard to tell based on images from the game: </p>
<p>“The fog ― that was crazy. I have never seen that,” New England quarterback Tom Brady told the Worcester Telegram. “It was just so still out there. The fog had no place to go. I don’t think it affected much, really, at the end of the day. I’m sure it looked cool on TV, though.”</p>

<p>Sports Illustrated’s prediction three years ago that the Houston Astros would win the 2017 World Series was even more prescient than we thought.</p>
<p>Not only did the magazine successfully name the Astros as the champs ― the team accomplished that Wednesday night with a 5-1 Game 7 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers ― the magazine also foretold the MVP.</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>Check out that 2014 cover photo. That’s George Springer, then a rookie on a team that had lost more than 100 games during the previous three seasons. Springer was named the MVP on Wednesday after smashing his record-tying fifth home run in the series.</p>
<p>Pretty good for not having a crystal ball, Sports Illustrated.</p>
<p>Previously:</p>
<p>For the Win pointed out Sunday that the sports magazine predicted that the Houston Astros would win the 2017 World Series ― back in 2014. </p>
<p>The Astros are four victories shy of making fortune tellers of S.I. after beating the New York Yankees in the American League Championship series to earn a berth in the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers beginning Tuesday.</p>
<p>But back when the 2014 article was published that June, the Astros had lost more than 100 games in three straight seasons and were en route to a 70-92 record.</p>
<p>The story lauded the rebuilding strategy of the Astros’ front office and featured outfielder George Springer on the cover with the out-on-a-limb headline: “Next Big Thing ... Your 2017 World Series Champs.”</p>

<p>It’s a strange phenomenon that has taken root since President Donald Trump took office. Every time a major event occurs, those inhabiting the Twitter universe unearth an old Trump tweet, many of them sent while he was still just a reality TV star, and find that it can be related to today. </p>
<p>On Saturday, we learned that the phenomenon stretches into the world of professional sports.</p>
<p>After the Houston Astros shut out the New York Yankees from the World Series on Saturday night, beating them 4-0 in the deciding seventh game of their series, Twitter found a 2012 tweet Trump wrote about the Yankees and then-President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>People were surprised that the old Trump tweet trick could even work with Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>Trump’s Twitter feed can be a treasure trove of hypocrisy for those willing to dig deep enough in his timeline.</p>
<p>For example, there’s an appropriate tweet for every time Trump hits the links at one of his golf courses.</p>
<p>Or when he reflects on the electoral college:</p>
<p>Or when he’s dealing with the disastrous storms to hit the U.S. this year:</p>
<p>Whatever else is hidden in Trump's Twitter feed, we can rest assured that the Twitterverse will dig it up. </p>

<p>By Rory Carroll</p>
<p>(Reuters) - The Houston Astros reached Major League Baseball’s World Series for the first time since 2005 after beating the New York Yankees 4-0 in Game Seven of the American League Championship Series on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Astros, who rallied from a 3-2 deficit in the best-of-seven series, will face the Dodgers when the World Series begins on Tuesday in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Astros starting pitcher Charlie Morton threw five shutout innings, allowing two hits and a walk while striking out five.</p>
<p>Reliever Lance McCullers Jr. came on in the sixth and recorded his first career save after pitching four scoreless innings while giving up just one hit and striking out six.</p>
<p>The Astros scored three runs in the bottom of the fifth with the key hit coming off the bat of catcher Brian McCann, who lined a two-out double into the right field corner to score two and push the lead to 4-0.</p>
<p>Designated hitter Evan Gattis and second baseman Jose Altuve each contributed solo home runs in the ballgame.</p>
<p>Astros owner and chairman Jim Crane thanked the team’s fans for sticking with the club even while it continues to recover from Hurricane Harvey, the deadly storm that ravaged the city in late August.</p>
<p>“Everybody has been pulling together and it is kind of a dream come true for this city to make it this far and have a chance to win the World Series,” he said.</p>
<p>The Yankees, who had won three straight in New York to force the Astros to play two elimination games, could not find their offense in Houston, scoring just one run in the final two games of the series at Minute Maid Park.</p>
<p>The Yankees came within inches of tying the game with the Astros leading 1-0 in the top of the fifth.</p>
<p>Yankees first baseman Greg Bird raced home from third on an infield grounder but Astros third baseman Alex Bregman picked it up and made a gutsy throw to McCann at the plate for the out, which sent the orange-clad Astros fans into a frenzy.</p>
<p>Yankees All-Star slugger Aaron Judge came to the plate in the top of the eighth with a runner on and a chance to cut the Astros lead in half with a homer, but McCullers struck him out to end the inning and preserve the 4-0 lead.</p>
<p>“There are things we need to get better on and that will be a focus but I’m extremely proud of this group,” Yankees manager Joe Girardi said after the game.</p>
<p>The Astros last reached the World Series in 2005 when they were swept 4-0 by the Chicago White Sox.</p>

<p>(Reuters) - The Los Angeles Dodgers are back in Major League Baseball’s World Series for the first time since 1988 after beating the Chicago Cubs 11-1 on Thursday to clinch the National League Championship series 4-1.</p>
<p>Los Angeles outfielder Enrique Hernandez struck three home runs, including a grand slam in the third inning, and drove in seven runs at Wrigley Field in Chicago.</p>
<p>Los Angeles will meet either the New York Yankees or Houston Astros in the World Series, which starts in Los Angeles on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Yankees lead the Astros 3-2 in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series ahead of Game Six in Houston on Friday and, if needed, Game Seven on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Dodgers have won the World Series five times since moving from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1958, most recently in their last trip to the ‘Fall Classic’.</p>
<p>“Feels good to hear (the words) ‘World Series,’” Los Angeles starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw said. “It’s been a long time coming for this team. I never thought in a million years I’d get to play a World Series.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how to compare it to years past but everybody has a role and everybody executes. It just seems like there’s a different superstar every night.”</p>
<p>While the Dodgers celebrated, the Cubs’ season concluded with barely a whimper, 12 months after they ended a century-long drought by beating the Cleveland Indians in the seventh game of the World Series.</p>
<p>The Cubs were never in it on Thursday, as the Dodgers batters jumped all over Chicago starter Jose Quintana.</p>
<p>The Colombian left-hander barely made it out of the second inning, replaced by Hector Rondon with nobody out and the bases loaded in the third.</p>
<p>Rondon quickly struck out Logan Forsythe before Hernandez sent the first pitch he faced over the ivy wall to make the score 7-0, effectively ending the contest.</p>
<p>Hernandez matched a major league playoff record with seven RBIs, while every position player had at least one hit for Los Angeles as they racked up 16 in all, to the Cubs’ four.</p>
<p>Kershaw got the win after giving up three hits and one run over six innings.</p>
<p>A three-times Cy Young Award winner for best pitcher in the National League, he improved his mediocre postseason record to 6-7, while the Dodger bullpen pitched three scoreless innings, extending their streak to 23 consecutive scoreless innings.</p>
<p>Cubs manager Joe Maddon lamented his team’s lack of offense in the series, but also complimented the Los Angeles pitching.</p>
<p>“Give the Dodgers credit, they pitched well, had a great plan, stuck to it, didn’t walk anybody,” he said.</p>

<p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell continues to walk a fine line on players kneeling during the national anthem, saying on Wednesday that he and team owners believe “everyone should stand” for it, but that the league is not adopting an ironclad rule on the issue.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure we are understanding what the players are talking about” through the protest movement, Goodell told reporters after a two-day owners meeting in New York. “And that’s complex.”</p>
<p>“It’s important for us to honor our flag and our country and we think our fans expect us to do that,” Goodell said.</p>
<p>But he also said that this week’s discussions among the owners and league officials did not include whether the language in the NFL’s policy would be changed from “should stand” to “must stand.”</p>
<p>The “take a knee” movement ― which protests racial injustices, especially police brutality against people of color ― was started last year by Colin Kaepernick, then a quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers. Kaepernick is currently not on a team, and he is accusing owners of colluding to keep him from playing.</p>
<p>Goodell said the NFL has “about a half dozen players that are protesting,” and that “we’re going to continue to work to try to put that at zero.”</p>
<p>The protests, though, have often involved far more than six players. WNBA players also have knelt during the anthem, and members of a German soccer team did so last weekend.</p>
<p>Goodell’s comments came only a few hours after President Donald Trump tweeted that the NFL had shown “total disrespect” with its decision to “not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem.”</p>
<p>Goodell said the players who have been protesting were “not doing this to be disrespectful to the flag, but they understand how it’s being interpreted.”</p>
<p>He said he hadn’t talked to Trump about the matter, and does not plan to.</p>
<p>He also said the league will “continue to encourage” players to stand during the anthem, but that he and other NFL executives are working with players to see what changes can be made in their communities.</p>
<p>“I personally have taken the time to go ... and figure out what are the things in our communities that our players are expressing,” Goodell said.</p>
<p>“Our clubs have a much better understanding of that from the meetings over the last several weeks,” he added. </p>

<p>Former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick will win and lose with the collusion grievance he’s filed against the NFL. The win is easy. The NFL season is nearly half over. Several starting NFL quarterbacks have gone down, or have been banged around to the point where their playing status is touch and go, game by game. The most recent to go is Green Bay QB Aaron Rodgers.</p>
<p>Yet, not one of the 32 NFL teams has expressed any real interest in giving Kaepernick a tryout. A handful of owners, GMs and coaches have gone further and said either he wouldn’t fit in their offensive scheme or flatly told the truth, and said, he’d be a “distraction.” He was simply not worth the hassle. So, Kap really didn’t have anything to lose in filing his grievance. He’s out. He’s effectively blackballed.</p>
<p>The odds that he can actually prove that two or more owners got together exchanged texts, emails or left some paper trail in which they agreed that they’d do everything they could to make sure he never suited up again on their team or any other NFL team because of his views and protest is slim to none. However, he doesn’t really need to uncover that smoking gun document to make his case that 32 NFL owners have slammed the NFL door to him. He’s a player at the peak of his career, had relatively good stats, won many games as a starter and could help several struggling teams as a back-up.</p>
<p>The exclusion of a player with those credentials is unprecedented in the NFL. Still, it does not meet the sky-high bar to prove collusion but it reinforces what many in the sports world, many NFL players, and many in surveys and polls have said about him. The grievance is a public relations coup that no amount of money could buy. The complaint forced the NFL to scramble and issue pious statement after pious statement that it respects individual freedoms, including the right of players to protest. It challenges the owners to do more than pay lip service to backing social justice causes and the fight against racial injustice.</p>
<p>It forced NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to swiftly squash media speculation that the NFL owners at their scheduled meeting would clamp down on the player’s anthem protests by making it mandatory that they stand at rapt attention during the playing of the anthem. This all can be chalked up largely to Kap’s grievance. The other win is that it stiffens the sternum of the NFL players association in their coming contract talks with NFL owners about pay, revenue sharing, health benefits, with special emphasis on the concussion issue. The grievance will also bolster the association’s demand for loosening owner controls on what players can and can’t say and do as NFL players. This is huge given that the NFL is not, and never has been, a democracy. It’s an owner’s autocracy in which the players in times past have been expendable and readily replaceable cogs in a revolving door with little to no say so about the NFL rules and playing conditions. The grievance put a major chink in the NFL’s seeming untouchability on player rights.</p>
<p>This is all great for the players, and their association. It’s great for Kap in that he can claim much of the credit for shaking up the league, much of the sports establishment, and even causing a significant number of NFL and sports fans to think hard about police abuse and racial injustice in society. Ironically, this is where he loses. He will continue to be vilified, scorned, and ridiculed by many more in the sports establishment and other NFL fans and sports enthusiasts as being the one who ruined football and sports by ramming those inconvenient issues and politics into the sports arena. With the likelihood good, that he will not win his complaint, he will not get the millions in pay and damages that have bandied about as the pay-off if he did prevail. Even worse, he has effectively killed any slender, remote chance that he ever had of playing again in the NFL. He will be the Curt Flood of pro football; a man who took a stand, won a victory for the players, but who paid a heavy personal price for that victory.</p>
<p>Some say that Kap knew the risk he was taking when he took his stand, and that he was prepared to pay the price for it. That may or may not be the case, but what is undeniable is that Kap still wants to play football, NFL football and has dropped many hints about that. So, it’s facile to say the least, that he had any desire to be the Rosa Parks of sports. He’s a pro football player, first and foremost, and that’s what he’d still love to be on the field in an NFL game. Sadly, that’s his loss. But it’s football, the sports world and America’s gain.</p>

<p>In an attempt to sum up the struggles of the previously winless Giants, Michaels joked: “The Giants are coming off a worse week than Harvey Weinstein.”</p>
<p>Michaels later apologized for referencing the now-infamous film producer who faces mounting allegations of sexual harassment and assault. </p>
<p>Michaels was also hit with a rush of social media reaction. </p>

<p>This NFL celebration was captivating.</p>
<p>After Washington cornerback Kendall Fuller intercepted a pass to seal a 26-24 victory over the visiting San Francisco 49ers on Sunday, the player and his teammates simulated an arrest.</p>
<p>Fuller put his hands up as safety D.J. Swearinger imitated patting him down and leading him away in handcuffs.</p>
<p>Given the controversy over NFL players’ national anthem demonstrations to highlight police brutality and racial injustice, the choreographed stunt appeared mighty provocative at first.</p>
<p>But Swearinger told The Washington Post that the antics were merely a “signature” move of the “Flight Marshals,” which he nicknamed Washington’s secondary earlier in the year.</p>
<p>“He locked the game up at the end, so I had to lock him up,” Swearinger said of Fuller in the so-called “stop and frisk.” “I just told him big players make big-time plays in big-time situations. And he did that.”</p>

<p>Colin Kaepernick has filed a grievance against the National Football League, accusing owners of colluding to keep him from playing, according to reports from 6 ABC and Bleacher Report.</p>
<p>Kaepernick received national attention last year when he knelt at a football game during the national anthem. Then a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, Kaepernick explained that his act was a form of silent protest to raise awareness about police brutality and racial injustices in the United States. Critics of the quarterback have claimed that the act of “taking a knee” is disrespectful to the American flag and the military. </p>
<p>At the end of last season, the quarterback opted out of his contract with the 49ers and entered free agency, allowing him to play with other teams. But Kaepernick has yet to sign with a new team. His grievance accuses team owners of violating the league’s collective bargaining agreement. </p>
<p>Kaepernick’s lawyer, Mark Geragos, released a statement on Sunday.</p>
<p>“If the NFL ... is to remain a meritocracy, then principled and peaceful protest — which the owners themselves made great theater imitating weeks ago — should not be punished and athletes should not be denied employment based on partisan political provocation by the Executive Branch of our government,” Geragos said. </p>
<p>It’s highly unusual for quarterbacks to spend so long in free agency, especially one with Kaepernick’s record. Kaepernick, 29, managed to throw 16 touchdowns with four interceptions in a matter of 12 games with the 49ers. </p>
<p>FiveThirtyEight analyzed the length of free-agency periods for quarterbacks in March and again in August in the last five years, showing that Kaepernick’s situation was an outlier. Kaepernick was most recently snubbed by the Tennessee Titans, who denied him the chance to work after the team’s current quarterback was injured.</p>
<p>Many sports fans and analysts have remarked that the quarterback’s inability to get a job is a blatant result of the NFL kneeling protests. President Donald Trump further fanned the flames after he implicitly called Kaepernick a “son of a bitch” and called on NFL fans to boycott games when kneeling occurred. </p>
<p>Trump’s words only pushed more players to kneel in protest.</p>
<p>While most Americans support the idea of free speech, polls have shown that their opinions don’t necessarily support the NFL players’ peaceful protest. </p>

<p>German soccer team, Hertha Berlin, shocked fans when they took a knee on the field before their match Saturday.</p>
<p>Players in the National Football League have been widely criticized for kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice in the United States. Hertha Berlin players adopted the act as a message of tolerance and a move of solidarity with the protesting NFL players.</p>
<p>“Hertha BSC stands for tolerance and responsibility,” the team tweeted. “For a tolerant Berlin and an open-minded world, now and forevermore!” </p>
<p>NFL protests began last year when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the anthem as a silent protest against racial injustice. The protest has been widely criticized as disrespectful to the American military. Players maintain that the act of peaceful protest raises awareness to the problems marginalized minorities face. </p>
<p>And the act has gone international.</p>
<p>“We are living in the 21st century, not the 18th century, but there are some people who haven’t developed their ideologies accordingly,” Hertha player Sebastian Langkamp told Sky Sports. “If we can give them a bit of help in doing so, then that’s good.”</p>

<p>The NFL will never give up the national anthem salute. The NFL owners in one form or another will make it official when they meet to hammer out a policy on what players must do when the national anthem is played. Let’s be clear, the NFL’s tie to the national anthem has nothing to do with the oft-cited contention that the Defense Department bribed the NFL to the tune of $5 million between 2011 and 2014 to honor soldiers and vets at its games. This supposedly required players to stand at rapt attention during the playing of the anthem before games. $5 million is not even pocket change to a multi-billion-dollar league.</p>
<p>It also has nothing to do with a bunch of ticked off NFL owners hectoring the players to beat back their sideline protests and show them who is boss. And it certainly isn’t because one owner, namely Dallas Cowboy’s owner Jerry Jones, has been screaming loudly that the national anthem must be respected no matter what.</p>
<p>The national anthem and the flag are not just the nation’s enduring symbols and paean to American patriotism, they are the standard for America’s military tradition and might. From its very inception and its rising popularity in the latter part of the 19th century, football has been inseparable from both. West Point and the military academies used football as a training vehicle to recruit, train, instill toughness and discipline and most importantly prepare its cadets for warfare. By the turn of the 20th century, football was played on 20 of the nation’s military bases. During World War I, football was virtually enshrined on the military bases to instill military discipline and combat toughness.</p>
<p>By World War II, football had virtually become part of the curriculum within the military academies. It got a virtual exemption from the tight constraints put on civilians during the war. Even when some college games were cancelled at the mid-point of the war in 1942, and non-essential civilian travel was barred, the Army-Navy game was still played. Government officials considered the game vital to the nation’s morale.</p>
<p>Football crowds were revved up with military bands, flag salutes and displays, and cannon and gun blasts. The ritual included continual reminders of, and tributes, to active servicemen and women and veterans bedecked in full military regalia, decorations and medals. The NFL quickly fell in line and embedded the rituals of military pomp, flag and patriotic displays into all pre-game activities. The players and coaches and even team owners have dutifully answered the call to arms over the years. More than 1,200 have served in combat and other service capacities in World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars. For more than a half century, NFL players under the league’s official auspices and in tandem with the USO have trekked to military bases, ships and even combat areas from Vietnam to Iraq on goodwill tours to boost troop morale.</p>
<p>That’s not all. The NFL is not just in the business of paying salutes out of history and tradition and patriotic loyalty to the military and the flag. It’s also in the business, literally, of promoting both. It has a lucrative partnership with USA Football, Inc. which licenses and sells millions of NFL apparel and paraphernalia that carry the NFL logo and uniform designs through the NFL FLAG program. NFL FLAG also sponsors and promotes youth training camps, and football related sports programs.</p>
<p>The military and patriotic rah-rah came easy for an NFL which is not, and never has been, a democracy. It’s a quasi-militaristic, top-down organization. It’s run by an entrenched elite core of billionaire owners who set the tone and determine policy for the league. They are mostly conservative Republicans, some very outspoken Republicans. They have contributed money, lots of it to Trump and other GOP presidential candidates over the years.</p>
<p>Then there’s the NFL’s majority fan base. They have made it clear in informal polls, surveys, and by raining loud boos down on the relative handful of NFL players that have knelt during the national anthem that they will have no regard for any player who “disrespects” the flag. Many go much further than Jones and are not content with benching them, but want them out of the league. They certainly have made that clear about the man who started it all, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. They don’t want him in the league, and the owners have heard them. They listened to them and blackballed Kap because they are the ones who pack stadiums and plop down tens of millions for tickets and assorted NFL paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Some players, some sportscasters, some elected officials, and all civil libertarians will shout that compelling NFL players to stand for the national anthem is crass, crude, employer bullying and a blatant disregard of the First Amendment. They’re right. But the brutal reality is that the NFL power brokers have the supreme dominance to enforce their “take it or leave it” dictate on the players, and a big part of that will remain standing bolt upright for the national anthem.</p>

<p>In an effort to end the ongoing debate around standing or kneeling during the national anthem prior to NFL games, Commissioner Roger Goodell wrote a letter to team executives saying the league needs “to move past this controversy” and that a plan for doing so would be discussed at a league meeting next week.</p>
<p>Goodell offered no details on the plan, but said “like many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand” during the anthem, and that he wanted the matter resolved “together with our players.”</p>
<p>Goodell made only a vague reference to why the athletes are kneeling ― in protest of police brutality, particularly against unarmed people of color. Instead, he praised players and owners “who have done the hard work over the past year to listen, understand and attempt to address the underlying issues within their communities” ― without specifying what he later termed “critical social issues.”</p>
<p>He asserted that the kneeling “is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now dividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country.”</p>
<p>“Like many of our fans, we believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem,” he said. “It is an important moment in our game. We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us. We also care deeply about our players and respect their opinions and concerns about critical social issues. The controversy over the Anthem is a barrier to having honest conversations and making real progress on the underlying issues. We need to move past this controversy, and we want to do that together with our players.”</p>
<p>The letter was sent to all 32 teams.</p>
<p>Protests during the national anthem began last year when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeled while it played. Although Kaepernick, now a free agent, remains unsigned by any other team, many more players have taken a knee in solidarity ― an act that has led to harsh backlash by some, including President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>During a rally last month in Alabama, Trump said of the kneeling protests: “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’” </p>
<p>That statement acted as a catalyst for the even more players to protest, and spurred some NFL owners to release statements disavowing the president’s commentary.</p>
<p>But Goodell’s letter comes after Vice President Mike Pence last Sunday abruptly left a game in Indianapolis after several players on the visiting 49ers kneeled during the anthem.</p>
<p>Pence tweeted that he left because neither he nor Trump will “dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.” Minutes later, Trump tweeted that he had instructed Pence to leave the game if players knelt ― leading to speculation the vice president’s appearance was a “political stunt.”</p>
<p>Later Sunday, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he expected all players on his team to stand during the anthem, and that any member of the squad who “disrespects the flag” would be benched.</p>
<p>Goodell ended his letter by saying he looks “forward to a full and open discussion of these issues” when the team owners meet in New York.</p>
<p>“The NFL is at its best when we ourselves are unified,” he wrote. </p>

Watt Tells Houston He's 'Devastated' After Serious Injury" date="2017-10-09" authors="Jenna Amatulli">
<p>During Sunday night’s game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Houston Texan defensive end J.J. Watt suffered a tibial plateau fracture in his left leg.</p>
<p>Watt’s injury happened in the first quarter of the game, collapsing when his left knee buckled while attempting to tackle Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith. His recovery timetable is uncertain, according to a report from ESPN’s Adam Schefter, and he will be out of the season indefinitely.</p>
<p>“I can’t sugarcoat it, I am devastated,” Watt wrote on Twitter Monday. “All I want to do is be out there on that field for my teammates and this city. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>The NFL player’s injury comes merely five games into the season. In 2016, Watt was only able to play in three games due to a back injury.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a ton of information about it, but I feel terrible for the guy,” Texans coach Bill O’Brien told The Washington Post. “But with that being said, just knowing him and knowing the type of guy that he is, he’s an amazing human being. And he will work extremely hard to be back to play for this football team. I know that.”</p>
<p>This season had more significance for the Texans beyond football, as The Washington Post noted. Watt “became an inspirational civic leader” after Hurricane tore through Houston, bringing unprecedented flooding and widespread damage to the area.</p>
<p>“If he was beloved before, he’s something else now,” the outlet noted.</p>
<p>Watt ultimately raised more than $37 million in relief efforts for his home city in a crowdfunding campaign with an initial goal of $200,000. Watt began the fundraiser with $100,000 of his own money.</p>
<p>Get well soon, J.J. </p>

<p>CBS sports reporter Jason La Canfora sparked outrage on Sunday when he falsely reported that former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick would stand for the national anthem if signed to a team.</p>
<p>Last year Colin Kaepernick, then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback, knelt during the national anthem at a game and created a controversy that has yet to blow over. The act of “taking a knee” was originally intended by Kaepernick to silently protest the systematic racial injustices in the United States, but critics claimed that the act was a disrespect of the American flag and military. </p>
<p>Kaepernick opted out of his contract with the 49ers at the end of the season, and has curiously remained an unsigned free agent. Most believe that his controversial protests are the reason that teams refuse to sign the quarterback.</p>
<p>La Confora was originally reporting on Kaepernick’s desire to work with NFL teams to get back in the game when he made an erroneous claim about whether or not the quarterback would continue to protest. </p>
<p>″He’s not planning on kneeling,” La Canfora said on “The NFL Today” on Sunday. “He’s going to donate all his jersey sales and he’s planning on standing for the anthem if given the opportunity, J.B.”</p>
<p>The Associated Press also reported the claims, based on La Confora’s supposed interview, and spread the news even further. Nessa Diab, Kaepernick’s girlfriend, tweeted a correction to the piece, calling the report completely false. </p>
<p>“The reports that Colin will stand for the anthem are completely false! He has never discussed this with anyone,” Diab wrote on Twitter.</p>
<p>Fans of the quarterback on social media were deeply angered by the mistake, calling the report a lie. After tremendous Twitter backlash, La Confora issued a clarification to his statements on air.</p>
<p>“Wanted to clarify one thing regarding @Kaepernick7,” La Confora tweeted. “When I was asked about his [sic] whether or not he would sit or stand for anthem, standing for Anthem wasn’t something that I spoke to Colin about sat. I relayed what had been reported about him standing in the future.” </p>
<p>ESPN did report, using unnamed sources, that Kaepernick would stand in the 2017 season back in March. However, those claims were never confirmed and La Confora supposedly sat with Kaepernick for hours before Sunday’s segment on the quarterback’s future.</p>
<p>Kaepernick seemed to respond to the claims using a fake Winston Churchill quote on Twitter.</p>
<p>“A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on, Winston S. Churchill,” Kapernick tweeted Sunday.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether Kaepernick intended to misquote the former prime minister of the United Kingdom to further his point or whether it was a mistake.</p>

<p>Tampa Bay Lightning forward J.T. Brown raised his right fist during the national anthem before a game against the Florida Panthers on Saturday night, becoming the first NHL player this regular season to join the silent protests that have been sweeping the NFL and other U.S. sporting leagues.</p>
<p>Unlike Colin Kaepernick, the football player last year who began taking a knee during the national anthem to protest racial inequality, Brown — who, according to The Tampa Bay Times, is one of about 30 black players in the NHL — chose to stand throughout the anthem. Video shows Brown with his eyes closed and head bowed as the anthem played, his left hand wrapped around his hockey stick and his right hand raised in a closed fist.</p>
<p>As ESPN notes, the NHL has no specific rules “governing what players must do during the national anthem.” </p>
<p>Following the game, Brown said he chose to raise his fist during the anthem to “show my support.” </p>
<p>“There are some issues that we have to talk about,” the 27-year-old told the Times. “So, in my mind, just trying to bring a little more awareness, and any type of conversation that we can get started would be great. I know there’s going to be negative backlash. But, in my heart, I know I did what was right.”</p>
<p>He had protested similarly in at least one preseason game. </p>
<p>In a statement, the Lightning said they “respect[ed]” Brown’s decision to protest. </p>
<p>“We respect our players and individual choices they may make on social and political issues,” the team said. </p>

<p>The New York Knicks remained standing for the national anthem ahead of their game Tuesday night, but the players linked arms instead of placing their hands over their hearts, as the team had said they would.</p>
<p>The Knicks made their announcement in apparent response to the NBA’s memo, reportedly issued last week, that requires all players and coaches to stand during the patriotic pre-game moment.</p>
<p>“We have a deep love and respect for this country,” the Knicks tweeted from their public relations account. “The United States has given us all so much including an unbelievable opportunity and platform to stand up for what’s right.”</p>
<p>“Today, our country faces serious issues including gun violence, poverty, equal justice, access to education, and civil rights,” the team said, adding that their linked arms would be an effort to “call attention to these issues.”</p>
<p>Standing together, the team said, “is how we honor the sacrifices made to defend liberties.” </p>
<p>The Knicks’ gesture was the latest in a series of high-profile athletes’ protests against racial injustice sparked by former NFL star Colin Kaepernick in 2016. After Kaepernick began taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police shootings of black people, other professional athletes have followed suit. Some of them have chosen to make other protest gestures, including linking arms or remaining in the locker room while the anthem is played.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump renewed the debate over these silent demonstrations in late September when he called the kneeling players “sons of bitches” and urged team owners to fire players who didn’t stand during the anthem. Trump’s remarks quickly inspired nearly all NFL teams to join the protest in some way during pre-game ceremonies. Soon after, NBA teams and even some Major League Baseball teams joined in.</p>
<p>Responding to the new wave of protests, NBA commissioner Adam Silver said he expected all NBA players to stand for the anthem, but added that he also expected players to continue their civic engagement in other ways.</p>
<p>This past Friday, a day after Silver’s comments, the league distributed the memo reminding teams of the rule that players and coaches must stand during the anthem, ESPN reports. The memo said that no team had the “discretion to waive” the rule and that the league had the power to discipline players who did not stand.</p>
<p>Knicks players participated in the Kaepernick-inspired protests during the anthem last year, but this year feels different, according to star center Joakim Noah.</p>
<p>“Obviously it’s a very confusing time in this country and as athletes, we have platforms,” Noah told the New York Post during a Saturday practice.</p>
<p>“For some reason, I feel like things are a little different,” Noah said. “I don’t know why. I feel like there’s more emphasis on it. Shout out to Kaepernick for that.”</p>

<p>The NFL plans to honor the victims of the deadly shooting in Las Vegas, Nevada, by holding a moment of silence before the “Monday Night Football” game between the Washington Redskins and the Kansas City Chiefs. The teams are set to play in Arrowhead stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
<p>“The Commissioner has asked that there be an on-field moment of silence for Las Vegas before tonight’s game,” The NFL Commissioner’s office told HuffPost. “This will be a moment of reflection for the victims, their families and loved ones and also for the heroic efforts of the first responders.”</p>
<p>In the wake of the tragic shooting during an outdoor concert in Las Vegas that left more than 50 people dead and hundreds injured, ESPN announced the network will air the national anthem as well as the moment of silence. </p>
<p>Sports Illustrated reporter Richard Deitsch first reported the news on Twitter.</p>
<p>Though there was no official statement, a rep for ESPN confirmed to HuffPost that the anthem would air. </p>
<p>The network had previously announced it would no longer be airing the national anthem before games in order to devote more on-air time to game coverage.</p>
<p>According to The Washington Post, ESPN has aired the anthem twice this season: once before the “MNF” premiere, which fell on the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, and again last Monday, amid protests against President Donald Trump’s criticism of players kneeling during the national anthem.</p>
<p>The NFL’s television partners, including Fox Sports, NBC Sports, CBS Sports, NFL Network and DirecTV all provided live coverage of that week’s anthem, according to Yahoo. Fox Sports announced Sunday that the network would no longer air the national anthem before football games after last week’s coverage.</p>
<p>Some teams are taking additional action in response to the Las Vegas tragedy.</p>
<p>The Oakland Raiders have donated $50,000 to those affected by the shooting. The team, which will eventually be relocating to Vegas, confirmed the donation to SFGate.</p>

<p>It’s probably safe to say Marshawn Lynch won’t be supporting a re-election bid for President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The Oakland Raiders running back showed up to Sunday’s game against the Denver Broncos in a black T-shirt featuring the words “Everybody vs. Trump” across his chest. Lynch has been known for his blunt honesty ever since he told a room of reporters he was only attending a press conference so he wouldn’t be fined. </p>
<p>Lynch’s shirt is likely a reference to the ongoing tension between Trump and the National Football League. Lynch was one of the first players of the 2017 season to stay seated during the national anthem, a move that began with then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick as a protest against racial injustice and police brutality. </p>
<p>Critics have alleged that “taking the knee” during the national anthem is an act of disrespect to the flag and the United States military.</p>
<p>Last week, Trump called the players who kneel “sons of bitches” and suggested during a rally on Sept. 22 in Alabama that fans should boycott games. Since then, players across the league have been kneeling or standing with linked arms in defiance of the president’s comments. </p>
<p>Supporters of the protest went to Twitter to express their delight with Lynch’s loud, yet still silent, disapproval of Trump.</p>

<p>LOS ANGELES (Reuters) ― Onetime “Trial of the Century” defendant O.J. Simpson could be freed as early as Sunday from prison in Nevada, where he has been held since 2008 for a botched robbery, but the time and place of his release remain secret, his plans largely unknown.</p>
<p>Simpson, 70, won his freedom from a Nevada parole board in July after nine years behind bars, at a hearing that did not take into account his 1990s trial for the murder of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and a friend, Ron Goldman.</p>
<p>The onetime football star turned actor and TV pitchman nicknamed “The Juice” during his playing career was found not guilty in 1995 following that sensational, 13-month trial in Los Angeles, which was televised live daily, transfixing much of the nation.</p>
<p>A civil court jury subsequently found him liable for the deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5 million in damages to the victims’ families, a judgment that remains largely unpaid.</p>
<p>The Nevada Department of Corrections, seeking to avoid the kind of media frenzy that often accompanies Simpson, has declined to say exactly when and where he would be released.</p>
<p>A department spokeswoman warned media not to try to chase his vehicle from the prison gates, saying officials could postpone the release for weeks if necessary to avoid “risk to the community” from such a frenzy.</p>
<p>Also unclear is the former star athlete’s ultimate destination. He told parole board members he hopes to move to Florida, where he has friends and family, a plan that must be approved by probation authorities there.</p>
<p>During the parole hearing, Simpson joked that he was willing to stay in Nevada, but “I‘m sure you don’t want me here.”</p>
<p>His Las Vegas–based attorney, Malcom LaVergne, reiterated the Florida plans during an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America” program on Friday, adding that his client was looking forward to spending time with family members, eating steak and seafood and buying an iPhone.</p>
<p>LaVergne could not be reached for comment by Reuters.</p>
<p>Florida corrections officials say they had not received a parole transfer request for Simpson and had not been contacted by their counterparts in Nevada.</p>
<p>Simpson is a native of California, born in San Francisco, and played his final years as a pro football player for that city’s team, the 49ers. He lived in Los Angeles at the time of the murders.</p>
<p>But California corrections officials say he has not filed papers to live in that state, either.</p>

<p>While President Donald Trump continues to criticize the displays of protest and unity during the national anthem at NFL games, the Seattle Seahawks have decided to go one step further to promote equality for all.</p>
<p>The team announced Friday that it is launching a charity fund that will benefit education and leadership programs that fight inequality and promote justice, according to its official announcement.</p>
<p>The project was dubbed the Seahawks Players Equality & Justice for All Action Fund and aims to “build a more compassionate and inclusive society,” the team said in a statement. </p>
<p>The Seahawks announced its fund one week after the team skipped the national anthem, following the lead set by former San Fransisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who took a knee during the anthem in 2016 in response to the spike in police shootings of black people.</p>
<p>Kaepernick started his controversial protest because, as he explained last year, “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.”</p>
<p>Though many people see the gesture as disrespectful, other football players began following suit by taking a knee or linking arms during the anthem.</p>
<p>Trump reignited the debate last week when he called for fans to boycott games and asked NFL team owners to fire players who protested during the national anthem. </p>
<p>Since then, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and nearly all coaches and team owners have spoken out against the president’s comments in some way. And NFL teams across the board have demonstrated their own forms of protest during the anthem, like both the Seahawks and Tennessee Titans did during their game last week.</p>
<p>The Seahawks said in a statement that it still needs put together an advisory board made up of players and business and community leaders who will determine which nonprofits will be receiving the money raised.</p>
<p>“I think it’s imperative,” Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman said of the newly launched fund. “The way things are, you want to be a shining example of what things could [be] and how people could come together, and how it looks when people do come together and unite as one, and don’t look at skin color, don’t look at gender, don’t look at anything but the quality of someone’s character.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to do our best to be that example.”</p>

<p>Chicago Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan has been suspended for two weeks after his illegal hit landed Green Bay Packers receiver Davante Adams in the hospital on Thursday.</p>
<p>Jon Runyan, the National Football League’s vice president of football operations, issued the decision on Saturday. Adams caught a pass midfield during the third quarter when he was hit by the Bears linebacker. Trevathan’s move had fans and commentators in an uproar, calling the dangerous helmet-to-helmet hit a “dirty” play.</p>
<p>A statement from the NFL’s communications office clarified that the unpaid suspension was due to Trevathan’s violation of Rule 12, Section 2, Article 6 (i) of the league’s player safety rules. </p>
<p>“There shall be no unnecessary roughness,” the statement reads. “This shall include, but not be limited to: (i) using any part of a player’s helmet or facemask to butt, spear, or ram an opponent violently or unnecessarily.”</p>
<p>Medical personnel took Adams off the field on a stretcher and he received preliminary exams for head and neck injuries at the stadium. He was later taken to the hospital for further testing. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported that Adams suffered a concussion from the hit. </p>
<p>The Packers receiver tweeted on Friday that he was at home “feeling great.” </p>
<p> As more studies reveal the prevalence of CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, in former football players, hits such as the one Adam are fueling calls for more rule changes in the National Football League. The degenerative brain disease has increasingly been found in postmortem tests on former players who had suffered repeated blows to the head. CTE can cause impulse control problems, memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment and eventually progressive dementia. </p>

<p>Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh got a chance Thursday to weigh in on the NFL’s national anthem protests during an appearance on Fox News ― and he took the ball and ran with it.</p>
<p>Limbaugh told host Sean Hannity the growing demonstrations are part of a liberal plot to hurt the NFL and its promotion of “masculinity” and “rugged individualism.”</p>
<p>“I do believe that the left wants to cause great damage to the NFL,” Limbaugh said in a clip posted by Media Matters.</p>
<p> What does the NFL stand for? Masculinity, strength, toughness. So, what are they doing to it? You go to college campuses now and you’ll find classes on how to take masculinity out of men. It’s actually happening. There are studies and courses in college that do this. It’s patriotic, you’ve got the flag, you’ve got the anthem, you’ve got uniformed military personnel, all the things that the left wants to erase from this country. </p>
<p>Since President Donald Trump called on team owners to fire players who kneel during “The Star-Spangled Banner,” protests have increased far beyond last season, when then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand in order to raise awareness of police brutality and racism. Last weekend’s league-wide activism on the field has once again sparked national debate on those issues, and also prompted some backlash from fans.</p>
<p>Many players have stressed what the protests are really about ― that is, systemic injustice ― but Limbaugh told Hannity he knows the real culprit: lefties.</p>
<p> They don’t like displays of patriotism, strength, rugged individualism, and that’s why the players are being used here. They think it’s about police brutality, they think it’s about righting social wrongs, and so forth. This is an attack on the NFL as an institution for shaking it down and lowering its profile and impact on American culture. We’re in the midst of a culture war. Everybody knows it. </p>
<p>He added that team owners are driving their fan base away by “assuming we live in a left-wing society.” Watch the whole clip above.</p>

<p>Most rookies in the National Football League might use their first game check to buy a flashy car or pay for a lavish night out, but not Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old donated his $27,353 check to three women who were affected by Hurricane Harvey, ESPN reported. Watson surprised them with the envelopes in a video that was posted to the team’s Twitter account Wednesday. </p>
<p>“I’m excited to do a surprise for the cafeteria ladies. They’ve been helpful for all of us,” Watson said in the video. “It’s going to be cool.”</p>
<p>A team representative told HuffPost that the women are cafeteria workers employed by NRG Stadium and serve the Texans breakfast, lunch and dinner. Two of the women lost everything when Hurricane Harvey brought catastrophic flooding to the area, the team told HuffPost. </p>
<p>“For what y’all do for us every day, and never complain, I really appreciate y’all,” Watson said in the video. “I wanted to give my first game check to y’all to help y’all out in some type of way.” </p>
<p>Fellow Houston Texans player J.J. Watt raised over $37 million for Hurricane relief and spent some of his time before the season distributing supplies for victims of the natural disaster. </p>
<p>When Watson, who grew up in Georgia and played at Clemson, handed the women the checks, one of the workers teared up and asked for a hug. </p>
<p>″So hopefully that will help you get back on your feet, and anything else y’all need, I’m always here to help,” Watson said.</p>

<p>Many President Trump observers believe he throws out inflammatory and divisive comments to distract in moments when the news cycle is critical of his erratic, inappropriate and contentious conduct. That appeared to be true last week when more than 3 million suffering Americans without power or enough food and water in hurricane devastated Puerto Rico were desperately crying for more federal help. Senate Republicans were busy introducing another callous health care repeal bill to deny millions of Americans life giving health care to widespread criticism and President Trump was spouting rhetoric which threatened to bring our nation closer to a military confrontation with North Korea’s intemperate leader. As if these crises were not enough distraction, President Trump chose to pick a loud unpresidential fight urging football players who chose to kneel during the national anthem in nonviolent protest be fired. His blatant and sad attempts to pit us against each other as Americans should shame us all.</p>
<p>It did not take long to recognize that the specter of President Trump in Alabama standing before a boisterous, largely white crowd condemning a predominantly black group of citizens for a peaceful method of nonviolent protest against injustice was chillingly familiar. Rev. Bernice King, Martin Luther King Jr.’s daughter, was one of many who immediately pointed out historical parallels. On Twitter, she shared photos of civil rights leaders kneeling in protest next to a photo of NFL players Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid kneeling before a game. It was former Super Bowl quarterback Kaepernick who made the first quiet, courageous and moving decision of conscience last year to kneel during the national anthem written by a white pro-slavery supporter. He was personally and nonviolently protesting against a string of indefensible police-related killings of black men and the pervasive racial and social injustices evident all across our nation. Reid and then others joined in the peaceful and prayerful gestures of conscience that triggered President Trump’s vulgar and utterly unpresidential outburst. Along with photos of her father, Bernice King commented:</p>
<p>People didn’t approve of the way my father protested injustice either; said he was causing trouble, called him an “outside agitator.” #MLK</p>
<p>Many who quote #MLK today, and use his words out of context to deter nonviolent protest, would have hated him openly then. </p>
<p>Veteran Congressman and courageous civil rights icon John Lewis shared his photo kneeling with fellow protesters outside a segregated Illinois pool in 1961:</p>
<p>The young people kneeling today are following a long tradition. #TakeAKnee #goodtrouble</p>
<p>Former Attorney General Eric Holder was among others who shared a photo and message about Dr. King: </p>
<p>“Taking a knee is not without precedent Mr. President. Those who dared to protest have helped bring positive change.”</p>
<p>As one of many many hundreds of thousands of people who protested, marched, sat and – yes – knelt and went to jail like Dr. King and John Lewis during the Civil Rights Movement I know this is true. I applaud athletes using their visible public platform to protest racial injustice and carry on a morally courageous legacy so needed today in our nation and world. Americans standing up or kneeling down to insist our nation live up to her founding creed of liberty and justice for all are standing on the shoulders of moral giants throughout America’s history.</p>
<p>Every single movement for equality and justice in America from the Revolution through fights for an end to slavery, women’s rights, gay and lesbian rights and more has faced loud, dangerous, and often violent opposition. There always have been people in power who condemn as un-American any and all forms of protest and any challenge to the nation’s economic, racial, gender and other forms of discrimination however unjust. I urge all of us to engage in what Congressman Lewis calls “good and necessary trouble.”</p>
<p>In a New York Times op-ed – “Why Colin Kaepernick and I Decided to Take a Knee” – Eric Reid said: “It baffles me that our protest is still being misconstrued as disrespectful to the country, flag and military personnel. We chose [the respectful gesture of kneeling] because it’s exactly the opposite. It has always been my understanding that the brave men and women who fought and died for our country did so to ensure that we could live in a fair and free society, which includes the right to speak out in protest. It should go without saying that I love my country and I’m proud to be an American. But, to quote James Baldwin, ‘exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.’”</p>
<p>Dr. King would cheer. He said: “I criticize America because I love her, and because I want to see her stand as the moral example of the world.” I hope all our children will be willing to live their conscience unbridled by political or cultural criticism. Kudos to athletes and others willing to risk careers and endure the ire of haters and shameful role models, including the president of the United States, who stand with white supremacists. All attempts to denigrate, distract and divide us by anyone in high and low places must not and will not prevail. We are better than this in America. True patriots and people of all major faiths must never cease to honor the creed and struggle to close the gaps between creed and deed.</p>

<p>A young Dallas Cowboys fan wearing a San Francisco 49ers jersey walked into a GameStop in Virginia and left with an Xbox One purchased by two Washington Redskins players.</p>
<p>The reason? Ten-year-old Jaden Watts was wearing Colin Kaepernick’s number.</p>
<p>The heartwarming moment, which took place in Dulles earlier this week, captured the current spirit of the NFL. In recent months, many players across the league have followed Kaepernick’s lead and peacefully protested against police brutality, racial injustice and in defiance of President Donald Trump. </p>
<p>In comments posted to Facebook, Saundra Watts said her grandson Jaden walked into a GameStop while she was next door at a makeup store. He then ran back to her saying that some guys wanted to buy him an Xbox One.</p>
<p>“So I go next door and as I am walking over there I am thinking what pervert wants to buy my grandson an Xbox,” Saundra wrote on Facebook. “I am thinking he is going to be in for a rude awakening when I bust through these doors. (I am an advocate for abused and neglected kids).”</p>
<p>But the two men were Washington Redskins players Keith Marshall and Rob Kelley. Jaden said they complimented his jersey, noticed he was asking about an Xbox for his birthday and offered to buy it for him.</p>
<p>“Me nor my granson [sic] had a clue who they were,” Saundra wrote. “They now have 2 fans for life.”</p>
<p>Jaden told the Washington Post he was a Cowboys fan but liked the 49ers and Kaepernick because of his decision to kneel during the national anthem last season. The former 49ners player remains unsigned this year.</p>
<p>“I liked how he wasn’t afraid to show what he thought,” Jaden said. “I don’t know if people agree with it, but he just doesn’t care what people say and that’s inspired me and probably inspired other people.”</p>
<p>A man who observed the encounter posted about it on Facebook and the story soon went viral. The Washington Redskins also tweeted about the moment as did GameStop.</p>
<p>Since describing players who kneel during the national anthem as “sons of bitches” last weekend, Trump has continued to double down on his criticisms. He’s even called for team owners to fire protesting players.</p>
<p>Trump’s reaction has prompted players in many sports to speak in support of the peaceful protests and against racial injustice and police brutality.</p>

<p>Green Bay Packers receiver Davante Adams suffered a brutal blow to the head Thursday night in a game against the Chicago Bears in Wisconsin. </p>
<p>Adams caught a pass mid-field during the third quarter when he was hit by Bears linebacker Danny Trevathan. Trevathan, who received a personal foul penalty, could possibly face suspension over the seemingly illegal hit. </p>
<p>Adams, No. 17, was taken off the field on a stretcher after the helmet-to-helmet impact. He underwent preliminary tests for head and neck injuries, including the possibility of a concussion, at the stadium. </p>
<p>“Adams is conscious and has movement in all his extremities,” the Packers tweeted after the hit. “He’s been taken to a hospital for further testing.” </p>
<p>“That’s not OK right there,” sportscaster Tony Romo said during a replay of the collision.</p>
<p>Frank Schwab, editor of “Shutdown Corner” on Yahoo Sports, echoed that assessment: “A message needs to be sent that headhunting and trying to injure fellow players isn’t OK with the league.”</p>
<p>As more studies reveal the prevalence of CTE, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, in former football players, hits such as the one suffered by Adams are fueling calls for more rule changes in the National Football League. The degenerative brain disease has increasingly been found in postmortem tests on former players who had suffered repeated blows to the head. CTE can cause impulse control problems, memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment and eventually progressive dementia.</p>
<p>Researchers from VA Boston Healthcare System and Boston University School of Medicine recently found evidence of CTE in 110 of 111 brains of deceased NFL players. </p>
<p>One of the biggest problems with CTE diagnosis is that scientists have yet to find an effective test for patients who are still living. </p>

<p>“Real Sports” host Bryant Gumbel ended his Tuesday show with a powerful message that started with thanks to President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Gumbel said the president’s “racist, churlish and childish” comments attacking protesting NFL players “energized the social conscience of the modern American athlete.” </p>
<p>“Those of us who have long focused on the intersection on sports and society have often wondered what it would take for today’s athletes to forsake the path of least resistance and actually stand for something,” Gumbel said. “And now we know.” </p>
<p>Gumbel said athletes today have an especially important role ― to use their athletic platforms to challenge authority in the pursuit of justice. </p>

<p>The presence of activism on the sports field dates back decades to the civil rights movement, and should unite athletes in the protest controversy engulfing the American professional sports landscape, according to Sports Illustrated.</p>
<p>“Athletes Are Not Going to ‘Stick to Sports’ and That’s an Admirably American Thing,” is the title of this week’s cover piece. The cover illustration shows professional athletes and National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell ― all in black and white ― linking arms in front of a red, white and blue backdrop.</p>
<p>Hundreds of athletes and dozens of team owners decided to kneel, sit, link arms or otherwise protest during national anthems across the country at Sunday’s games after President Donald Trump stoked the flames, encouraging team owners to fire a “son a bitch” who disrespects the American flag.</p>
<p>Sports Illustrated writer Charles Pierce offers several examples of moments when political activism in relation with the national anthem have gotten athletes into trouble, both in the U.S. and around the world. Today’s protests, he wrote, are to be expected because “the inclusion of a national anthem—any national anthem—in a sporting event necessarily politicizes that event.”</p>
<p>The difference, he added, is that today’s protests aren’t directly about the government, but are more about the activity of an entity linked to the government. “The protestors are high-profile African-American athletes raising awareness of how lower-profile African-Americans are often mistreated by police officers.”</p>
<p>Strong, effective messaging, Pierce continued, is bound to make some people uncomfortable. Trump, among other things, says the protests are disrespecting the country. Those who love their country, he added, stay away from NFL games altogether these days. The White House chief of staff chimed in, telling CNN he was appalled by players’ lack of respect. “Every American should stand up and think for three lousy minutes,” John Kelly said. </p>
<p>Yet sports and politics are inherently tied, as HuffPost’s Travis Waldron notes. “The existence of the NFL as a multibillion-dollar business enterprise today is a direct result of its aggressive political engagement ― a tradition that is, in fact, older than the Super Bowl. The league doesn’t stick to sports; why should its players?”</p>

<p>Over the weekend the issue we focus on at RISE became the biggest story in the country when the president publicly scathed athletes for expressing their First Amendment rights to bring attention to racial inequality.</p>
<p>The collective response from owners, coaches, players and front office staff throughout the NFL was a show of unity rarely seen in an industry that is about competition and beating your opponent.</p>
<p>One by one, each team expressed in their own way their commitment to raising awareness around ways to advance equality and ensure that our country lives up to the ideals of the Constitution.</p>
<p>But what comes next?</p>
<p>This week we launched RISE to Vote, a yearlong nonpartisan campaign that aims to register as many athletes as possible to vote and encourages them to spread the important message of voting to their fans.</p>
<p>In our democracy voting is one of the most tangible things you can do to promote social change and bring about a better world. According to our data, as someone becomes a registered voter, it’s often the first and most influential step they can take toward being engaged in local issues. And by becoming active and informed citizens we can impact our world on a local, state and national level.</p>
<p>RISE to Vote is partnering with state and local election officials and nonpartisan organizations like the League of Women Voters and the Drum Major Institute with expertise in leading and executing effective voter registration drives in all 50 states. Our goal is to encourage athletes to become informed and engaged citizens and inspire their fans to do the same.</p>
<p>Four professional teams – the NFL’s Atlanta Falcons and Miami Dolphins and the NBA’s Atlanta Hawks and Brooklyn Nets – already have completed RISE to Vote sessions, where the players also met with Martin Luther King III, who spoke to them about the significance of engaging in our democracy.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning.</p>
<p>More and more teams from across various sports leagues are ready to hold RISE to Vote sessions. This movement can begin with professional athletes but grow to one that involves coaches, staff, fans and student-athletes who follow in the steps of their role models. Information about the importance of voting could be distributed, and registration could be offered at major sporting and community events. Athletes can voice the importance of voting through social media and can go back to their hometowns or universities and hold voter registration drives of their own.</p>
<p>The work that’s required to bring people together and advance equality and positive change in our country becomes more powerful and effective when athletes are leading the charge. And, as I recently told The Washington Post, regardless of your political leanings, we all have a stake in making sure our society is one where we are unified.</p>
<p>One of the most moving and inspiring moments I’ve observed this week was seeing Martin Luther King III, oldest son of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., remind athletes that his father stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in May 1957 and said, “Give us the ballot, and we will transform the salient misdeeds of bloodthirsty mobs into the calculated good deeds of orderly citizens.”</p>
<p>The athletes in the audience heard his message and responded by registering to vote and embracing their rights and their power to change the world.</p>
<p>As we move forward to Week 4 of the football season, we can anticipate that other issues will emerge to dominate our national discourse. But what will remain is a steadfast and growing number of athletes at every level in every league registering to vote and leading their fans to do the same.</p>

<p>It is hard to deny that Colin Kaepernick picked an excellent method to raise awareness to racial inequalities and injustice in the United States of America. NFL players kneeling during the national anthem reached an all time high last week. The nation erupted into a national debate after President Donald Trump stirred the pot on Twitter. With Colin Kaepernick no longer in the NFL, we must finish what he started.</p>
<p>In order to move forward, we must listen to our fellow Americans. Not listen to respond, but rather listen to understand. Once we understand why people are doing certain things we can move forward.</p>
<p>We need to understand that while the protesting method may be disrespectful in some people eyes it was a desperate call for a desperate measure. We must each ask ourselves what is going on for these fellow Americans to use these tactics as a call for help.</p>
<p>We also need to understand that history isn’t the same for every citizen. It is easy to say that demonstrators are disrespecting the military since they fought for freedom and defended the flag and that has become the main focus of the debate.</p>
<p>With that thought in mind, civil rights activists are equally American heroes who fulfilled the national anthems lyrics by making this country the land of the free for everyone. Many of these heroes paid the ultimate price fighting for their rights. Without these heroes black people would not be able to attend the same schools as everyone else, marry outside of their race, drink out of the same fountains, use the same bathrooms, vote without intimidation, and sit in the front of a bus.</p>
<p>When we honor the American flag and national anthem we must honor all American heroes and anyone who has fought for American freedom and values in addition to the military. We must understand our history and how it has shaped the landscape of our country.</p>
<p>If we listen and try to understand the rest will take care of itself. This is the first step to working together as one united nation.</p>

<p>Below is the first interview Colin Kaepernick explaining why he didn’t stand for the anthem.</p>

<p>The widow of a former NFL player who died while serving in the U.S. Army issued a powerful response to President Donald Trump using her husband’s name to criticize athletes who protest the national anthem.</p>
<p>Trump on Monday retweeted a post that invoked former Arizona Cardinals safety Pat Tillman, who left the NFL to join the Army Rangers in 2002 and was killed by friendly fire two years later. The tweet in question urged fans to boycott the NFL in response to the dozens of players who sat out the national anthem on Sunday to call attention to racial injustice. Trump repeated this sentiment several times throughout the weekend and on Monday.</p>
<p>Marie Tillman rebuked Trump’s comments, saying that her husband died to protect freedoms including the right to peacefully protest.</p>
<p>“The very action of self expression and the freedom to speak from one’s heart — no matter those views — is what Pat and so many other Americans have given their lives for,” she told CNN’s Brian Stelter. “Even if they didn’t always agree with those views. It is my sincere hope that our leaders both understand and learn from the lessons of Pat’s life and death, and also those of so many other brave Americans.”</p>
<p>It’s not the first Marie Tillman has spoken out against Trump. In January, she also denounced his controversial executive order banning travel from several majority-Muslim countries.</p>
<p> “This is not the country [Pat] dreamed of, not what he served for and not what he died for,” she said. </p>

<p>Cosmetic patriotism always turned me off—as if by waving the nation’s flag big and proud, so everyone sees it, or by chanting U-S-A so the whole world hears —that somehow those displays make them more patriotic than those who don’t participate. It’s similar to how some religious people who wear their faith on their sleeves and in some cases, shame those who don’t.</p>
<p>But a great majority of patriotic Americans, while respecting the flag, national anthem and other symbols of our great nation—understand that what thousands before us died and fought for are the principles the flag represents.</p>
<p>Truth be told, real patriots aren’t “threatened” by peaceful protests on a football field, they understand the United States is the world’s beautiful democratic experiment “rooted”—at least on paper —in the core principles of freedom, equality and justice for all. And enshrined in those principles, comes the right to protest, to speak out against injustice, inequity or politics with the hope of bringing change.</p>
<p>But that sort of thinking might prove too difficult or complicated for an egomaniacal privileged boy from Queens who now finds himself serving as president of the United States. Back in the day, President Donald Trump used a heel spur to avoid the horror show that was Vietnam. Then on Friday night, he stood at an Alabama political rally and called out Arizona Senator John McCain for voting down a reckless repeal of the Affordable Health Care Act. John McCain is a hero who got tortured and held in solitary confinement for more than five years in a North Vietnamese prison after he got shot down by Viet Cong while he was fighting for his country in what was clearly a misguided war. Nonetheless, McCain was there, fighting for his nation—he is a patriot, not just someone who engages in self-serving theatrics and charged divisive language.</p>
<p>That Donald Trump, a self serving and ruthless real estate developer in NYC has the nerve and perverse ego to try and shame John McCain is grotesque. That Americans would applaud Trump’s words leaves me feeling sick for vast portions of my nation’s people.</p>
<p>It’s pathetic our president is far more self-serving and attention-loving than the well paid sports stars he critiques — as he further destroys any sense of reverence for the nation’s presidency. And it’s tragic so many Americans still back him and can’t seem to how he’s exploiting their passions for his own political gain.</p>
<p>While a flooded and powerless Puerto Rico pleas for help and assistance, as our neighbor Mexico picks up the pieces while recovery workers find and bury the dead and as parts of the great state of Texas continue to mop up infectious toxic sludge covering many poor neighborhoods around Houston, this president stirs up America’s awful ugly by blasting pro-sports athletes who engage in peaceful protests. His bully pulpit has proven to be pathetic, divisive and unhealthy for the nation. The hope is that the majority of the American people will see through his charade and rise to the occasion. The need for true patriotism has never been greater.</p>

<p>Miami Dolphins player Michael Thomas delivered a powerful response Sunday to President Donald Trump’s harsh criticism of NFL players protesting racial injustice. </p>
<p>“It just amazes me that with everything else going on in this world, especially involving the U.S., that’s what you’re concerned about, my man?” Thomas said, adding that he had taken it personally when the president referred to protesting players as “sons of bitches” on Friday.</p>
<p>The Dolphins safety fought back tears as he spoke about his daughter, arguing that players’ decisions to protest is bigger than the demonstrations on the field. </p>
<p>“I got a daughter. She’s going to have to live in this world,” Thomas said. “I’m going to do whatever I got to do to make sure she can look at her dad and be like, ‘Hey, you did something, you tried to make a change.’”</p>
<p>Thomas’ reaction echoed a tweet he sent on Sunday encouraging his followers to use their voices and platforms to stop racial injustice. </p>
<p>“This is bigger than us!!!” he wrote.</p>
<p>Last season, Thomas took a knee during every national anthem, the Sun-Sentinel reported. Though he stood during last week’s game, Thomas was one of the leaders of a team discussion on how to respond to Trump’s verbal attacks. Dolphins players who did not kneel on Sunday linked arms with their fellow players. Team owner Steve Ross joined in the human chain and locked arms with Dolphins players.</p>

<p>The Chicago Tribune did not mince words in describing the premature touchdown celebration of Chicago Bears cornerback Marcus Cooper on Sunday, calling him a member of the “Idiot Hall of Fame” for performing a “stupid move, even for a Bear.”</p>
<p>Watch below to see how Cooper earned the derision of the newspaper. A blocked field goal try from the visiting Pittsburgh Steelers landed right in his hands, providing a clear path to the end zone for an easy touchdown. Only Cooper loafed and showboated at the end ― and he got the ball knocked out of his hands by the Steelers’ Vance McDonald. </p>
<p>The Bears were given possession inside the 1-yard line after a Steelers penalty on the play, but they eventually settled for a field goal to take a 17-7 lead at the half. They won in overtime, 23-17, for their first victory of the season.</p>
<p>That TD would have come in handy, Marcus Cooper.</p>

<p>“Look football is great but I ain’t dying for this s―t. Lol” </p>
<p>That’s a tweet by the National Football League’s (NFL) Marcellus Bennett, the Green Bay Packers tight end. He was reacting to comments made the day after an NFL press conference held in July, in which New York Jets rookie Jamal Adams claimed he loves the game so much that if he had “a perfect place to die” it would be on the football field.</p>
<p>Thus, an already controversial topic, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) among professional football players, became even more contentious.</p>
<p>CTE is a condition characterized by brain degeneration and is associated with repeated head trauma. (Encephalopathy is a general term meaning disorder or disease of the brain.) It has led to behavioral and health problems, as well as death, among a number of players in the NFL. Subsequent lawsuits by players have resulted in what are expected to be millions of dollars in payouts by the NFL.</p>
<p>The current controversy began with the release of findings from a new study on the topic. A two-page spread in the front section of The New York Times only emphasized the drama. It featured a headshot of each deceased NFL player diagnosed with CTE and images of their brains following an autopsy.</p>
<p>The study was originally published on Tuesday, July 25 in The Journal of the American Medical Association. It found that among 202 deceased former football players, whose median age at death was 66 years old, CTE was diagnosed in 177. Most publicized was the deaths of those who were NFL players; it was determined that 110 of 111 of those players, or 99 percent, had various levels of CTE. It should be noted that the NFL players’ brains that were studied were not randomly selected. They were donated by families of those players who probably suffered from symptoms, indicating researchers were more likely to discover they had CTE.</p>
<p>The study was conducted by Dr. Ann McKee, a neurobiologist at the Boston University’s Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) Center. McKee has previously admitted there’s no way to truly know the prevalence of CTE without a means of testing living players. At this stage, determining CTE can only be done posthumously.</p>
<p>Media and public perception sometimes fail to give significant attention to the limits of these studies. This study duplicates others that have been done by McKee and her team of researchers at Boston University. They state in this paper, “Estimates of prevalence cannot be concluded or implied from this sample.” Therefore, despite what the public might conclude about the widespread nature of CTE, the study does not determine the number of players in the general NFL population who likely have the disease.</p>
<p>In addition, CTE is prevalent in more than just the NFL. In addition to football players, others with evidence of CTE include hockey players, soccer players and soldiers or others exposed to bombings. And even among athletes, CTE is not limited to professionals. It has been found in those who played college and even high school football.</p>
<p>What is CTE?</p>
<p>In addition to being controversial, CTE is a complex topic. It’s no wonder, considering the key functionality and remarkably intricate structure of the brain.</p>
<p>CTE, a progressive degenerative brain disease, is often found in athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. That trauma can be both symptomatic concussions, as well as subconcussive (asymptomatic) hits to the head. CTE was first recognized in boxers as far back as the 1920s and termed dementia pugilistica. From that derived the term punch drunk.</p>
<p>A feature of CTE is that it is triggered by the build-up of tau, naturally-occurring proteins that have become defective, and can be seen as tangles or bundles. This tau build-up leads to brain cell death, a similar phenomenon to Alzheimer’s disease. Uncommonly, but still a feature of CTE, are deposits of beta-amyloid, also a protein and characteristic of Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>Thus, there is evidence of a link between moderate and severe traumatic brain injuries to a higher risk of developing other brain conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>Symptoms of CTE include:</p>
<p>  Aggression   Confusion   Depression or apathy   Impulse control issues   Memory loss   Movement problems (e.g., tremors and stiffness)   Personality changes   Progressive dementia   Substance abuse   Suicidal tendencies  </p>
<p>The Prognosis</p>
<p>Despite increasing evidence clearly linking CTE to head trauma, there is much unknown about the disease. One thing is certain though: there is currently no cure for it.</p>
<p>While CTE is most likely to develop following numerous traumatic brain injuries (even without loss of consciousness), and/or a smaller number of severe traumatic brain injuries, there is no evidence that one concussion increases the risk of developing CTE. And even among those with a history of multiple concussions, not every one of them will eventually develop CTE.</p>
<p>It appears that regardless of the current findings and the questions surrounding CTE, some NFL players are not waiting to find out what could be in their future. According to NFL reporter Adam Schefter of ESPN, 14 players age 30 or younger have already retired from the NFL during the 2017 preseason. Twenty players retired at the same age during the 2016 season. Increasingly, the stated reason for “hanging up the helmet” is the fear of CTE.</p>

<p>Donald Trump’s demand while addressing an adoring crowd of white folks in Huntsville, Alabama that the rich, white, largely Republican owners of National Football League teams fire the “son of a bitch” among players who engage in symbolic protest has begun a fight he cannot win.</p>
<p>First, by using the term “son of a bitch” to describe the protesters who are trying to bring light to the current racial injustices in American society, Trump insulted the mothers of African-American athletes, thereby crossing a line that few people are foolish enough to do.</p>
<p>“Guess that makes me a proud bitch!” tweeted Teresa Kaepernick, the mother of Colin Kaepernick.</p>
<p>What followed was an outpouring of solidarity and protest from athletes, including two of the greatest basketball players in history, LeBron James and Steph Curry, as well as coaches, managers and fans from coast to coast and even in London. (The growing racial awareness in professional sports today is reminiscent of the era of Muhammad Ali, Tommy Smith and John Carlos.)</p>
<p>Prior to Sunday’s NFL games, the Seattle Seahawks’ players released a statement that sums up the sentiments of players throughout the league:</p>
<p>“We will not stand for the injustice that has plagued people of color in this country. Out of love for our country and in honor of the sacrifices made on our behalf, we unite to oppose those that would deny our most basic freedoms.”</p>
<p>Second, Trump chose to enunciate his “son of a bitch” barbs aimed at black athletes in Alabama – the state with a checkered racial history to say the least.</p>
<p>From the Tuskegee syphilis experiments in Macon County, to the Scottsboro Boys, to the Montgomery bus boycott, to the 50 unsolved terror bombings targeting black people in Birmingham from 1947-1965, to the vicious attacks on Reverend Fred Shuttleworth’s church, to the dogs and fire hoses, to “Bull” Connor and Governor George Wallace “standing in the schoolhouse door,” to the murder of four young girls at the 16th Street Baptist Church, Alabama has been the location of some of the worst racial violence in American history. Trump’s message in Alabama was clear: You black athletes work on our plantations, so don’t get uppity.</p>
<p>What followed from Trump after he sparked such a widespread backlash was the typical “punch, parry, kick” playbook Republicans use when they interject racism into the political discourse for electoral gain as Ian Haney Lopez presents in Dog Whistle Politics, an important book about how right-wingers use race as a cudgel to beat up their opponents.</p>
<p>First Trump “punched” racism into the dialogue with his “son of a bitch” statement before an adoring crowd of white Republicans in Alabama. Then he “parried” for the reporters saying that his words had “nothing to do with race.” What we’ll see next is the “kick” when Trump and his surrogates like Laura Ingraham, Breitbart, Drudge and Fox News denounce the African-American athletes for being the ones responsible for interjecting race in politics. It’s a classic tactic that people like Newt Gingrich and Rush Limbaugh have perfected over the years.</p>
<p>What Trump needs to learn is that there are no professional sports in this country without African-American athletes. Colin Kaepernick, who grew up in northern California and is clearly cognizant of the activism of black athletes who came before him (such as Tommy Smith and John Carlos, who were San Jose State students) as well as the power of high profile athletes to bring attention to racial injustice has started something big.</p>
<p>If Trump continues down this racist path through the rest of the football season the black NFL players should contemplate a direct action this February at the Super Bowl – that unparalleled orgy of advertising dollars and unbridled consumer capitalism unique to the United States – and SHUT IT DOWN!</p>

<p>Some NASCAR owners said they would fire employees who protest the national anthem, drawing praise from President Donald Trump on Monday.</p>
<p>Racing team owners Richard Childress and Richard Petty reacted strongly Sunday as NFL owners defended players protesting the national anthem following criticism from Trump. </p>
<p>The players staged a large-scale protest this weekend, with many sitting or taking a knee during the anthem. Trump had repeatedly called on owners to fire the players for not honoring the pregame ritual. </p>
<p>But auto racing veterans Childress and Petty sided with the president. </p>
<p>Asked how he would react if one of his employees protested during the anthem, Childress, owner of Richard Childress Racing, told USA Today, “Get you a ride on a Greyhound bus when the national anthem is over. I told them anyone who works for me should respect the country we live in. So many people have gave their lives for it. This is America.”</p>
<p>Petty, a seven-time NASCAR champion who is a co-owner of Richard Petty Motorsports, chimed in on the issue as well.</p>
<p>“Anybody that don’t stand up for that ought to be out of the country. Period,” he told the Associated Press. “If they don’t appreciate where they’re at … what got them where they’re at? The United States.” Petty confirmed with a reporter that he would fire employees who did not comply.</p>
<p>However, Andrew Murstein, also a co-owner of Richard Petty Motorsports, told ESPN he “wouldn’t fire someone for expressing their feelings” but he disagrees with the demonstrating.</p>
<p>“I would sit down with them and say it’s the wrong thing to do that [to kneel], and many people, including myself, view it as an affront to our great country,” Murstein told ESPN. “If there is disenchantment towards the president or a few bad law enforcement officers, don’t have it cross over to all that is still good and right about our country.”</p>
<p>Later on Monday, NASCAR issued a statement saying “our respect for the national anthem has always been a hallmark of our pre-race events” while it recognized “the right to peacefully express one’s opinion.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one of NASCAR’s star drivers, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., tweeted his support of “peaceful protest” earlier. </p>
<p>Other NASCAR team owners expressed their thoughts at Sunday’s race in Loudon, New Hampshire that was reportedly free of anthem protests.</p>
<p>Former Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs, who now owns Joe Gibbs Racing, also seemed to come out against the protests.</p>
<p>“So much has been sacrificed for our country and our flag,” he said, according to ESPN. “It’s a big deal for us to honor America.”</p>
<p>Walt Czarnecki, executive vice president of Penske Corp., told USA Today that Team Penske has no policy on the issue,</p>
<p>“It’s an issue we’ve never faced and don’t anticipate facing,” he said.</p>
<p>This weekend’s protest were inspired by ones led last season by then-49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who refused to stand for the national anthem to call attention to police brutality and racial injustice. Trump criticized the protests during a speech on Friday and in several tweets over the weekend.</p>
<p>This story has been updated to include comments from President Donald Trump, NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt, Jr., and NASCAR.</p>
<p>CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified Richard Childress in another photo.</p>

<p>I’d rather be in with the “sons of bitches” than the “very fine people.”</p>
<p>Please #TakeTheKnee. I don’t know why any NFL player would be reading my words, but if you are, unite around this cause — and heck, everyone, take a knee! If peaceful protests did not produce results, those in power would not work tirelessly to silence them.</p>
<p>Take a knee for justice not oppression, for unity not divisiveness, for respect not racism, for humanity not white supremacy, for equality not inequity, for inclusion not discrimination, for freedom of speech not suppression, for love not hatred, for peace not violence or police brutality, for the America that CAN be not the one put forth by the President, for black lives not black men and women being flagrantly gunned down in the streets and disproportionately locked up in prisons.</p>
<p>If you’re not outraged, you’re not paying attention. What is right is often not (rarely) popular, welcomed or easy; that does not make it one iota less important, necessary or critical.</p>
<p>Do not forget Trump’s divisive words, do not become distracted by his antics, do not let his offensive behavior slide, do not overlook his racist and white supremacist patterns, do not normalize any of the President’s unconscionable actions, of which this is just the latest heinous disgrace. Repeatedly insisting and claiming to not be racist, while saying and doing things that appeal directly to a racist base and employing rhetoric to unmistakably stoke fires of division, is racism in action; attacking black athletes and influencers should not be good politics for anyone. Donald Trump’s “logic” on the NFL – like so much he spews, champions or puts forth – is twisted, dangerous, pathetic, disheartening, tragic, sickening, backwards, racist, terrifying and plain wrong. Why is Trump focused on THIS (or attempting to distract the public) when well over 3.5 million American citizens are without power, struggling, suffering in Puerto Rico, plus millions more across Florida, Texas and the US Virgin Islands, in additions to countless fellow human beings, struck by natural disaster in the past couple of weeks?</p>
<p>The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees freedom of speech. Not only can we speak openly, express our beliefs, demonstrate peacefully, protest injustice, rather we are called upon to do all of that and more. Those are the precise values and rights for which our brave, patriotic men and women in uniform continue to risk their lives, even make the ultimate sacrifice, to protect and defend.</p>
<p>Please note, kneeling before the flag does not violate the US Flag Code Chapter 10 Respecting the Flag. However, the following are direct conduct violations: carrying the flag flat or horizontally; wearing it as apparel, bedding or drapery; using it for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever; embroidering it on cushions or handkerchiefs; impressing it on paper napkins or anything for temporary use; using any part in an athletic uniform or costume. But NOT taking a knee.</p>
<p>Twenty-seven players and staff boldly and courageously took a knee before the Jaguars-Ravens football game, many more linked arms in solidarity. That is the most ever, including Shad Khan, the only non-white owner in the NFL who also donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration; I guess he won’t be firing any of those players, defying Donald Trump’s call to his owner friends to “get that son of a bitch off the field right now” in his now infamous speech. Stevie Wonder set the tone when he took a knee for America at the Global Citizen festival yesterday. The Oakland A’s Bruce Maxwell became the first Major League Baseball player to kneel during the national anthem, marking what I believe will be an expansion of the emblematic physical statement into other sports.</p>
<p>I suspect we will be seeing hundreds of players, staff and fans demonstrate before today’s NFL games – and can only hope that white players recognize the importance of being an ally and accomplice in this struggle for human rights, of using white privilege for the benefit of our brothers and sisters, of defending dignity on the field and off. This is not merely about solidarity or football or the flag; we are all tied together in the common fabric of destiny, an inalienable truth.</p>
<p>Countless players are talented, proactive, leading, philanthropic citizens, forces for good who care deeply and serve communities around the country – and may that only continue to deepen, thereby inspiring, educating, mobilizing and empowering the masses. Professional athletes are role models for millions of people of all backgrounds, races, ethnicities, ages, genders, faiths, politics who are watching, listening and taking note. I am proud to see leadership, teams, owners, players, commentators, leagues, coaches, human beings strongly and vocally support “peaceful pursuits of positive change” and social justice, to borrow a phrase from the statement of the San Francisco 49ers, leading the way alongside our other Bay Area teams. May this not only shift the culture of the NFL and sports, but far more importantly, that of the United States of America – to be one of justice and equity, safety and freedom for all.</p>
<p>Get political. Get active. Get woke. Stand – or kneel – for something, for anything, for everything.</p>

Tures, ContributorProfessor of Political Science, LaGrange College">
<p>Last year, Donald Trump sharply criticized the National Football League during the 2016 campaign. But in 2016, the NFL set a revenue record, fueled by TV viewership. Trump is calling for another one, but you should expect the NFL to survive, and even thrive, thanks in part to rejecting Trump’s boycott.</p>
<p>Sports Business Daily and NBC Sports both reported that the NFL made a whopping $14 billion in revenue for 2016. That’s an increase of more than $900 million more than 2015 revenue, when Colin Kaepernick was just another player. Oh, and NBC Sports revealed that revenue was $6 billion in 2010, showing pro football is still on the rise. And Sports Business Daily revealed that the profits could be even higher; $14 billion is a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>That supports the argument that more people are watching the sport. Forbes claimed that the NFL ad buy revenue was up, even though they claimed that ratings were down. That’s because of two reasons. First, perhaps Forbes is mistaken in their belief that ratings were down (the article was surprisingly scant on providing such evidence for their claim).</p>
<p>Desperate to claim support for the NFL boycott, Rasmussen released results of another survey showing that, according to their findings, “34% of American Adults say they are less likely to watch an NFL game because of the growing number of protests by players on the field.”</p>
<p>Yet Rasmussen added that “These numbers are little changed from October of last year.” Given that the NFL ratings did not decline the way critics claimed, and the revenue the NFL made, such findings should be viewed with a fair amount of skepticism. It’s likely that a Rasmussen Report respondent expresses anger with the NFL in a poll, then watches more NFL games, or never watched them in the first place, being a fan of NASCAR or MLS or Antiques Roadshow. Otherwise, the profits and TV viewership wouldn’t be there.</p>
<p>So how did NFL revenue rise by nearly a billion dollars over last year?</p>
<p>1) NFL Playoff Ratings were up, even over the epic Chicago Cubs vs. Cleveland Indians World Series Game 7.</p>
<p>2) NFL regular season ratings rebounded, after having to compete with a contentious election season and an electrifying baseball playoff season that was one for the ages.</p>
<p>3) And NFL attendance was up, from 2015 to 2016, as well as the percentage of tickets sold per game.</p>
<p>4) Even Trump didn’t follow his own criticism of the NFL. That’s why Trump ran election ads during the NFL games in the midst of his campaign.</p>
<p>The “Boycott NFL” is destined to do as well as the boycott of the musical “Hamilton,” or of Stephen King’s “It.” We may find that Trump is as good for boycotts of sports and entertainment as Barack Obama allegedly was for the gun industry.</p>

<p>President Trump has once again attacked the NFL for exactly the wrong reasons. He wants NFL owners to fire players who take a knee during the national anthem. Their sin, according to Trump, is disrespecting the American flag. Trump also complains that the game has gotten soft, that big and exciting hits of the past are now penalized, so much so that today’s game is boring precisely because it’s insufficiently violent.</p>
<p>Nonsense. First, few players dare to use the game as a platform for protest, perhaps because they fear being blackballed like Colin Kaepernick, the talented quarterback who can’t find a job because he took a knee in protest against racism. Second, the NFL is awash in patriotic displays, everything from gigantic flags and military flyovers to special events to honor the troops. Just one example: During the opening game of this season, uniformed troops waving flags ran out on the field ahead of the New England Patriots as the team emerged from the tunnel. What are troops in camouflaged combat uniforms doing on the field of play?</p>
<p>With respect to violence, the NFL has only lately begun haltingly to address crippling injuries, especially brain abnormalities due to recurrent hits and concussions. Watching an NFL game is often an exercise in medical triage, as players are carted off the field with various injuries. A new feature this season is a tent on the sidelines that injured players may now enter to be treated away from the incessantly probing eyes of sideline cameras. Careers in the NFL are often cut short by crippling injuries, yet Trump claims the game is going down the tubes because it’s not violent enough.</p>
<p>Trump represents a minority view (I believe), but nevertheless a vocal one. Given his narcissism and the grudges he carries, one wonders if he attacks the NFL because of his failed bid to acquire the Buffalo Bills team back in 2014.</p>
<p>Football is the most popular sport in America. It speaks volumes about our culture. That Trump sees it as insufficiently violent and insufficiently patriotic — and that he’s cheered for making these claims — points to the gladiatorial nature of America’s imperial moment. Bread and circuses at home, costly and incessant wars abroad. And U.S. politicians who fiddle while the world burns.</p>
<p>Update: Trump’s comments have drawn a response during the first NFL game today (played in England). Here’s the headline at the Washington Post: NFL Week 3: Ravens, Jaguars respond to President Trump’s comments by linking arms, kneeling during anthem. It will be interesting to see how other teams respond today and during Monday night football.</p>

<p>Bruce Maxwell, catcher for the Oakland Athletics, just became the first major league baseball player to take a knee during the national anthem in Saturday’s game against the Texas Rangers.</p>
<p>The team released a statement on Twitter shortly after.</p>
<p>“The Oakland A’s pride ourselves on being inclusive,” the statement read. “We respect and support all of our players’ constitutional rights and freedom of expression.”</p>
<p>The political statement came a day after the president criticized athletes who protest during sporting events.</p>
<p> Last year, then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was booed for taking a knee during the national anthem while his team played the San Diego Chargers. Kaepernick said the silent protest was meant to bring awareness to injustices against minorities in the United States. It has been a source of controversy ever since. During a rally on Friday night, President Donald Trump outraged dozens of professional athletes when he implicitly called Kaepernick a “son of a bitch” and asked for athletes protesting to be fired.  </p>
<p>But Maxwell was undeterred.</p>
<p>He tweeted several times on Saturday in regards to the issue, saying it was about “just complete inequality.” He also wrote that no one should be “surprised if you start seeing athletes kneeling in other sports now.” </p>
<p>″Inequality is being displayed bigger than ever right now as our president shows that freedom of protest and speech is not allowed,” Maxwell tweeted hours before Saturday night’s game.</p>
<p>MLB.com’s Jane Lee tweeted a statement from Maxwell later in the evening, responding to negative comments he received for his protest.</p>
<p>“I get nasty DMs and everything, but that also shows what’s wrong with this country,” Maxwell said. “People think athletes should shut up and get their money and play their sport, but no matter how much money we make, no matter how many touchdowns we score, no many how many home runs we hit, it doesn’t mean we aren’t people. Our paychecks don’t silence us.” </p>
<p>Trump’s comments came after NBA star and Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry said he would not be attending the team’s visit to the White House. The president later rescinded the invitation and caused an uproar. </p>
<p> ″(Athletes are) all trying to do what we can,” Curry said Friday, before Trump’s rally. “We’re using our platforms, using our opportunities to shed light on that, so that’s kind of where I stand on it. I don’t think us not going to the White House is going to miraculously make everything better, but this is my opportunity to voice that.” </p>
<p> Earlier this year, several New England Patriots players refused to attend a celebration at the White House, a traditional visit for teams who win sports championships. Some of the players who stayed away said that Trump displayed racist rhetoric throughout his campaign and that they wouldn’t feel accepted in the White House. Major League Baseball has largely remained outside the issue, as the sport has comparatively kept silent on the politics of racial inequality in the country. Meanwhile, players of color in the NFL and the NBA have used their platforms to highlight the issue of racial injustice in the U.S. Basketball superstar LeBron James, who gave a scathing response to Trump’s comments about Curry on Saturday, expressed in a tweet why the matter was so personal and important to him. James was the victim of a hate crime earlier this year.  “Obviously, we all know what happened with Charlottesville and the divide that that caused,” James said. “And now it’s hitting home for me even more because [Trump]’s using sports as the platform to try and divide us.” This story was updated to include Bruce Maxwell’s statement to MLB.com.  </p>

<p>All eyes were on the NFL this weekend― but not just for what happened after the kickoffs.</p>
<p>NFL players throughout the country demonstrated before their games in defiance of President Trump’s harsh criticism of athletes who kneel during the national anthem. Former San Fransisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick spearheaded the movement last season as a way to call out racism. In a Friday speech in Alabama, Trump called such players “sons of bitches,” and then doubled down on his criticism in a series of follow-up posts on Twitter.</p>
<p>The first such protest occurred Sunday morning in London, and even included the owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars, Shahid Khan. He linked arms with his players — several of whom were kneeling during the anthem — despite having donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee.</p>
<p>Trump’s comments sparked a large social media response from a variety of professional athletes and celebrities, including singer Stevie Wonder, who took a knee during a performance Saturday night. The vast majority of NFL team owners, as well as the league’s commissioner Roger Goodell, also spoke out.</p>
<p>“The callous and offensive comments made by the President are contradictory to what this great country stands for,” 49ers CEO Jed York said.</p>
<p>Bruce Maxwell, a catcher for the Oakland Athletics, became the first major league baseball player to take a knee during the national anthem Saturday night.</p>
<p>Trump responded to the demonstrations Sunday afternoon. He supported the shows of solidarity of players linking arms, but still disapproved those who chose to kneel, calling it “not acceptable.” On Monday, he cheered fans who had booed some of the protesting athletes and claimed that his criticism had “nothing to do with race.”</p>
<p>Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Baltimore Ravens</p>
<p>Players and staff on both teams kneeled and linked arms during the national anthem. An estimated 27 individuals took a knee on the field.</p>
<p>Khan later said that it was a “privilege” to stand with the players.</p>
<p>“I met with our team captains prior to the game to express my support for them, all NFL players and the league following the divisive and contentious remarks made by President Trump, and was honored to be arm in arm with them, their teammates and our coaches during our anthem,” he said. “We have a lot of work to do, and we can do it, but the comments by the president make it harder.”</p>
<p> Future NFL Hall of Famer Ray Lewis, who visited then-President-elect Trump in New York in December, also kneeled. In the past, though, Lewis has spoken against Kaepernick’s protests. “But I am against the way he’s done it,” Lewis said. </p>
<p>Pittsburgh Steelers vs. Chicago Bears</p>
<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin announced that his team would be staying in the locker room during the national anthem during Sunday’s game. </p>
<p>“We’re football players, we’re football coaches. We’re not participating in the anthem today. Not to be disrespectful to the anthem, but to remove ourselves from this circumstance,” Tomlin told CBS News. “People shouldn’t have to choose. If a guy wants to go about his normal business and participate in the anthem, he shouldn’t have to be forced to choose sides. If a guy feels the need to do something, he shouldn’t be separated from his teammate who chooses not to. So we’re not participating today.”</p>
<p>As it turned out, almost all the Steelers declined to come out on the field for the anthem. Offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva, an Army veteran, broke with the team to stand on the field for the national anthem. When the Steelers emerged, many in the Chicago crowd booed them.</p>
<p>Miami Dolphins vs. New York Jets</p>
<p>Miami Dolphins player Julius Thomas announced that he would be taking a knee with his teammates. Both teams linked arms during the national anthem.</p>
<p>The Jets were joined by chairman and CEO Christopher Johnson.</p>
<p>“It was an honor and a privilege to stand arm-in-arm unified with our players during today’s national anthem,” he later said in a statement. “We are very proud of our players and their strong commitment to work in our community to make a positive, constructive, and unifying impact.”</p>
<p>Dolphins Owner Stephen Ross called the protesting athletes “men of character.”</p>
<p>“Our country needs unifying leadership right now, not more divisiveness,” he said. “We need to seek to understand each other and have civil discourse instead of condemnation and sound bites.”</p>
<p>New York Giants vs. Philadelphia Eagles</p>
<p>Philadelphia Eagles player Malcolm Jenkins announced his team will be locking arms during the national anthem. In the past, Jenkins has raised his fist during the national anthem as a form of protest.</p>
<p>Both teams locked arms during the national anthem and several Eagles players raised their fists. The Eagles owners stood with the players.</p>
<p>New York Giants owners John Mara and Steve Tisch sharply criticized Trump’s remarks, saying that “comments like we heard last night from the president are inappropriate, offensive and divisive.”</p>
<p>Atlanta Falcons vs. Detroit Lions</p>
<p>The owner of the Atlanta Falcons Arthur Blank stood on the sideline with his team.</p>
<p>“Creating division or demonizing viewpoints that are different than our own accomplishes nothing positive and undermines our collective ability to achieve the ideals of our democracy,” he said in a statement on Saturday.</p>
<p>Several Lions and Falcons players kneeled during the anthem, others linked arms in solidarity. </p>
<p>Rico Lavelle, who sang the anthem at Ford Field in Detroit, joined the demonstrations as well, finishing his rendition of the anthem by kneeling and raising his fist in the air. </p>
<p>Lions’ Owner Martha Ford expressed support for players’ right to protest in a statement on Sunday.</p>
<p>“Our game has long provided a powerful platform for dialogue and positive change in many communities throughout our nation,” she said.</p>
<p>Cleveland Browns vs. Indianapolis Colts</p>
<p>Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay said that he was “troubled by the president’s recent comments about our league and our players” while Browns owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam called out the “misguided, uninformed and divisive comments from the president.”</p>
<p>“Our stance in support of the liberties of peaceful, personal expression afforded to our players and all Americans will remain strong, and we will continue to encourage our players to respectfully use their earned platform to inspire positive change in our nation and throughout society,” the Haslams said in a statement.</p>
<p>Houston Texans vs. New England Patriots</p>
<p>New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who was considered a potential Trump supporter during the election, was seen linking arms with his fellow teammates, but also had his hand over his heart. </p>
<p>Patriots owner Robert Kraft, a friend and supporter of Trump’s, said that he was “deeply disappointed by the tone of the comments made by the president on Friday.”</p>
<p>“Our players are intelligent, thoughtful and care deeply about our community and I support their right to peacefully affect social change and raise awareness in a manner that they feel is most impactful,” Kraft said.</p>
<p>Texans CEO Robert McNair also criticized Trump’s comments as “divisive and counterproductive to what our country needs right now.”</p>
<p>New Orleans Saints vs. Carolina Panthers</p>
<p>The Panthers were not seen kneeling, but one player, Julius Peppers, was not on the field for the national anthem and later appeared.</p>
<p>“Our organization takes great pride in equality and inclusion and find the comments by the President disappointing and inappropriate relative to our players on this issue,” the Saints owners said in a statement.</p>
<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs. Minnesota Vikings</p>
<p>Vikings owners Zygi and Mark Wilf said that they were “proud of our players, coaches and staff for the important role they play in our community, and we fully support their constitutional right to respectfully and peacefully express their beliefs.”</p>
<p>Denver Broncos vs. Buffalo Bills</p>
<p>The Broncos were booed as many players chose to take a knee during the national anthem.</p>
<p>Broncos Chairman and CEO Joe Ellis meanwhile applauded the players for “raising awareness for important societal issues by using their platform in a positive way.”</p>
<p>Bills owners Terry and Kim Pegula said that,“President Trump’s remarks were divisive and disrespectful to the entire NFL community, but we tried to use them as an opportunity to further unify our team and our organization.”</p>
<p>Seattle Seahawks vs. Tennessee Titans</p>
<p>The Seahawks’ players announced before the game at LP Field in Nashville, Tennessee that they would not be participating in the national anthem to “protest the injustice that has plagued people of color in this country.” The team’s players revealed their decision in a statement to ESPN correspondent Josina Anderson.</p>
<p>Seahawks President Peter McLoughlin said that the team’s management “fully support[s] our players’ use of their freedom of speech and peaceful action to highlight the existing racial and other divides in our country.”</p>
<p>The Titans announced that they too will not appear on field during the national anthem in order to remain united as a team. Unlike the Seahawks, the Titans emphasized that the gesture would not be a protest of racism.</p>
<p>“As a team, we wanted to be unified in our actions today,” the team stated. “The players jointly decided this was the best course of action. Our commitment to the military and our community is resolute and the absence of our team for the national anthem shouldn’t be misconstrued as unpatriotic.”</p>
<p>Cincinnati Bengals vs. Green Bay Packers</p>
<p>Three Green Bay Packers players ― Martellus Bennett, Lance Kendricks and Kevin King ― sat during the national anthem, marking the first occasion when any member of the team protested during the song. Other players, including quarterback Aaron Rodgers, stood and locked arms.</p>
<p>“It’s unfortunate that the president decided to use his immense platform to make divisive and offensive statements about our players and the NFL,” Packers CEO Mark Murphy said in statement. “We believe strongly that players are leaders in our communities and positive influences. They have achieved their positions through tremendous work and dedication and should be celebrated for their success and positive impact.” </p>
<p>’We believe that it is important to support any of our players who choose to peacefully express themselves with the hope for good,” Murphy added. “As Americans, we are fortunate to be able to speak openly and freely.” </p>
<p>Kendricks went on to catch the Packers’ first touchdown of the game, performing the iconic “Lambeau leap” into the stands, where the fans received him warmly.</p>
<p>None of the Bengals players took a knee during the national anthem, choosing instead to stand and lock arms.</p>
<p>“Football and politics don’t mix easily. Fans come to NFL games to watch great competition on the playing field and that’s where our focus should be,” the team said in a statement.</p>
<p>Kansas City Chiefs vs. Los Angeles Chargers</p>
<p>Oakland Raiders vs. Washington Redskins</p>
<p>The Oakland Raiders offensive line, the only all-black unit in the NFL, sat alongside the entire team in protest during the anthem. Raiders players remained seated on the team bench, arms linked together, in a slightly different version of the “take the knee” protest.</p>
<p>The Washington Redskins had mixed responses during the anthem, with some players kneeling and the majority standing with linked arms. Redskins owner Dan Snyder stood with the team in solidarity with his players. </p>
<p>Snyder donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration committee earlier this year.</p>

<p>The NFL released a statement Saturday denouncing “divisive comments” that demonstrate a “lack of respect” for the league and its players, a day after President Donald Trump insulted players who protest during the national anthem and said they should be fired.</p>
<p>The league’s statement didn’t refer by name to Trump, who during a campaign rally in Alabama on Friday bashed “son of a bitch” players who take a knee during the national anthem in protest of social injustices. </p>
<p>Trump’s comments came during a rally in Huntsville, Alabama, where he was campaigning for Sen. Luther Strange (R).</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he’s fired’?” the president said.</p>
<p>He also said fans watching a game where that happens should leave.</p>
<p>Many individual football stars have been scathingly direct in their criticisms of the president’s comments. DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the NFL Players Association, said in a statement that the union would “never back down when it comes to protecting the constitutional rights of our players.”</p>
<p>The practice of players taking a knee during the anthem gained momentum last year, after Colin Kaepernick, then a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, did so at a preseason game.</p>
<p>“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick told NFL Media. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”</p>
<p>Kaepernick’s actions immediately incited controversy, and some have suggested his outspoken political views are the reason he hasn’t signed with a new team. Still, other players in the league — mostly men of color — have followed his example of quiet protest.</p>
<p>NFL owners gave a combined $7.25 million to Trump’s inaugural committee, according to The Daily Beast.</p>

<p>The San Jose Giants, a farm team for the San Francisco Giants, was forced to apologize earlier this month after it shared a tone-deaf tweet to celebrate its annual Japanese Heritage Night. </p>
<p>The tweet, a GIF that has since been deleted, featured three of the minor league players wearing traditional yukata-style bathrobes, with one person doing karate-like kicks, another fanning himself and a third bowing while wearing a rice farmer hat, The Mercury News reported.</p>
<p>After seeing the tweet, some Giants fans complained to the team, calling the tweet insensitive, offensive and racist.</p>
<p>However, not everyone found the tweet offensive. Some Twitter users who identified themselves as Japanese said they found nothing wrong with the team’s video. </p>
<p>But the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) did see a problem. The civil rights group said in a blog post that the baseball team’s GIF featured “stereotypical and derogatory caricatures of Japanese culture,” though they acknowledged that the graphic was quickly removed from the site.</p>
<p>“They’ll just make these mistakes over and over again,” Tom Oshidari, co-president of JACL’s San Jose chapter, told CBS SF. “It’s something that we’ll just have to keep fighting.”</p>
<p>“The offense is in the eye of the offended. So if somebody is offended, you offended them,” Oshidari said, later adding, “I think it’s a minor mistake. Hopefully they’ll do better going forward.”</p>
<p>Responding to the backlash, the SJ Giants issued an apology on Twitter and admitted that their tone-deaf tweet did not reflect the spirit of their Japanese Heritage Night at the park, which featured the Consulate-General of Japan’s Shoichi Nagayoshi, the Kakehashi Chorus and Taiko Drummers from Stanford University.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the San Jose Giants’ Japanese Heritage Night appeared to be a night filled with culture shared in a respectful way. </p>

<p>Saturday morning, President Donald Trump attempted to rescind a White House invitation he apparently had never extended, when he tweeted that Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry was no longer welcome to make the customary visit to celebrate the team’s NBA championship.</p>
<p>Curry, Trump said, was “hesitating” to commit to the trip ― an obvious falsehood, considering that the point guard had on Friday stated plainly that he had no interest in visiting the president.</p>
<p>The tweet followed Trump’s Friday night attack on NFL players who, inspired by the example of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, have spent the last year protesting racial injustice and police brutality during the national anthem. “Wouldn’t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, ‘Get that son of a bitch off the field right now,” Trump said at a rally in Alabama. “Out! He’s fired. He’s fired!’” </p>
<p>That, meanwhile, followed the White House’s decision last week to call for the firing of ESPN anchor Jemele Hill, who in a series of tweets had called the president a “white supremacist.”</p>
<p>Curry, Hill, and the vast majority of NFL players who have protested during the anthem, like Kaepernick, of course, are all African-Americans. In the span of less than two weeks, the president of the United States has used his bully pulpit three times to attack prominent black sports figures.</p>
<p>That is a remarkable and improper use of presidential power. But it is not at all surprising that sports figures have become the focus of Trump’s ire. </p>
<p>From boxer Jack Johnson to the University of Wyoming’s Black 14, from Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos to Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf and Craig Hodges, America has a long tradition of black athletes taking a stand against racial injustice. Black protest in sports tends to take the form of a freighted absence — Ali gone from boxing for three years; Abdul-Rauf in the locker room during the national anthem. Curry’s pointed withdrawal from the White House visit is of a piece with Kaepernick’s choice to sit during the anthem, which subsequently led the league to blackball him. ESPN, in its frantic attempts to keep Hill off the air, nearly created a charged absence right in the middle of its afternoon programming block.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of time before the racial reaction embodied by Trump’s presidency would explode across the sports landscape. There are few places in America where black people are more visible and their voices more audible than in the NFL and NBA, and on ESPN. Seventy percent of NFL players are black. Nearly three quarters of NBA players are. ESPN, for all its other faults, is by far the most racially diverse sports media outlet on the planet.</p>
<p>Echoes of the white grievance that powered the Trump campaign can be heard, for instance, in the complaints about ESPN’s liberal tendencies, a polite euphemism for the network’s blackness. They can be heard, too, in the furious response to Kaepernick’s protest, in which athletes represent an ascendant black power that is ungrateful for the opportunities extended to them, and wrong for pointing out the obvious racial injustices that still exist in the country. The backlash is fueled by the belief that, in return for million-dollar salaries and the fragile affections of many white fans, black sports figures are required to sacrifice their basic humanity and their right to participate in civic society. Curry and Kaepernick and Hill broke that unspoken agreement.</p>
<p>“What we do with the black athlete is say, ‘This is what you get,’” said Louis Moore, an author and history professor at Grand Valley State University. “We take these black athletes and say, ‘Look, they’ve made it! Anybody can make it in America!’”</p>
<p>“But the moment they speak up,” he continued, “they become problematic.”</p>
<p>Trump was speaking to this very sense of grievance in his follow-up tweets:</p>
<p>Trump and his supporters demand that athletes “stick to sports” on the premise that sports are not an acceptable arena for any discussion of social injustice, as if any other venue would be, as if sports themselves weren’t already deeply political, as if American sports weren’t the domain of government-abetted monopolists enjoying a set of power arrangements that—as athletes point out from time to time, to national opprobrium—aren’t as far removed from the plantation as we’d like to think. When Hill pointed out the plain fact that Trump is a white supremacist whose presidency is based on white supremacy, she knew what she was talking about. She covers sports, after all.</p>
<p>That they are rich and famous does not insulate black sports figures from America’s racist legacy, as is demonstrated by the cases of NBA player Thabo Sefolosha, former NFL running back Warrick Dunn, or former NFL wide receiver Anquan Boldin, whose cousin was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop. Trump has drawn such a forceful rebuke from so many athletes precisely because his words and policies directly affect them too.</p>
<p>In targeting Hill, Curry and NFL players like Kaepernick, Trump was goosing his small but fervent base of supporters, people who do not want to confront America’s racial realities through sports or anywhere else.</p>
<p>But if this weekend’s immediate response is any indication, Trump’s comments will only embolden athletes to take an even more forceful stance against him and what he represents. Numerous NFL players have already spoken out against his speech in Alabama. LeBron James called Trump a “bum” for his criticism of Curry. The NFL Players Association said that its members “can no longer afford to stick to sports.” North Carolina’s title-winning basketball team announced it would not visit the White House. And when a Twitter commenter asked Reggie Bush if he thought even more players would start kneeling during the national anthem, the former NFL running back responded only, “Yes.” The absence is growing. </p>

<p>Aaron Hernandez, the former football player who was serving a life sentence for murder before he died by suicide, had chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), according to a Boston University test.</p>
<p>The neurodegenerative disease has been linked to depression, memory loss and dementia. The Boston University CTE Center test determined Hernandez had Stage 3 CTE, with Stage 4 being the highest.</p>
<p>Hernandez played for the New England Patriots from 2010 to 2012. Earlier this year, he was found dead in his jail cell from an apparent suicide while serving a life sentence for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd.</p>
<p>Jose Baez, Hernandez’s attorney, said Thursday at a news conference that he has a filed a lawsuit against the Patriots and the NFL on behalf of Hernandez’s daughter, Avielle. In the suit, Baez alleges that the team and league were “fully aware of the damage that could be inflicted from repetitive impact injuries and failed to disclose, treat, or protect him from the dangers of such damage,” The New York Times reports.</p>
<p>In a statement released by Boston University, the researchers who examined Hernandez’s brain released an image and explained what they found. </p>
<p>“This graphic shows the classic features of CTE in the brain of Mr. Hernandez,” the statement reads. “There is severe deposition of tau protein in the frontal lobes of the brain (top row). The bottom row shows microscopic deposition of tau protein in nerve cells around small blood vessels, a unique feature of CTE.”</p>
<p>A recent study that examined 111 brains of former NFL players found that 110 of them had CTE, according to ESPN. Last year, a top health official with the NFL acknowledged a link between football-related head trauma and the brain disease.</p>
<p>So far, the disease can only be definitively detected through autopsies. </p>
<p>“We are grateful to the family of Aaron Hernandez for donating his brain to the VA-BU-CLF brain bank,” BU said in a statement.</p>
<p>Last year, BMX legend Dave Mirra was found to have had CTE when he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. </p>

<p>Jake LaMotta, the boxing legend whose life story became the basis of Martin Scorsese’s classic film “Raging Bull,” died Tuesday in Miami. He was 95.</p>
<p>LaMotta’s wife, Denise Baker, told ABC News her husband died in a nursing home from complications linked to pneumonia. The family is currently planning a memorial and funeral, but nothing official has been announced.</p>
<p>Robert De Niro, who won an Oscar playing LaMotta in “Raging Bull,” released this statement: “Rest in Peace, Champ.”</p>
<p>During a professional career that lasted 13 years from 1941 to 1954, LaMotta racked up a record of 83 wins, 19 losses and four draws, with 30 knockouts. A member of the International Boxing Hall of Fame, LaMotta was known for absorbing great punishment from his opponents. He was knocked down just once in his career, according to The Hollywood Reporter.</p>
<p>LaMotta told Esquire in 2012 he had convinced his body that no one could hurt him.</p>
<p>“I might’ve gotten cut, stitches over my eyes. Broken nose. Broken hands. But I never really got hurt,” he said.</p>
<p>His boxing career is most celebrated for his six-fight rivalry with Sugar Ray Robinson; LaMotta won just once. In 1949, he earned the world middleweight title when he defeated Marcel Cerdan, but later testified that he’d earned that title partly by taking a dive in a 1947 bout with Billy Fox, which paid $20,000, per THR.</p>
<p>After he retired, LaMotta worked as a comedian, a bar manager and an actor, nabbing over a dozen roles that included a bartender in the 1961 Paul Newman film, “The Hustler.”</p>
<p>In 1980, Martin Scorsese turned LaMotta’s 1970 memoir, Raging Bull: My Story, into a feature film that was nominated for Best Picture and won De Niro his second Oscar.</p>
<p>LaMotta was married seven times; he wed Baker in 2013.</p>

<p>The injured Mets pitching ace on Monday used the barrage of hurricanes to seemingly diss the president for dumping the Paris Climate Agreement.</p>
<p>Syndergaard, who included a #imatexanrepublican hashtag, received a “stick to baseball” comment from at least one responder, but others applauded him for expressing his view: </p>
<p>As for the science of linking the frequency and fury of recent hurricanes to climate change, well, that’s complicated.</p>
<p>Syndergaard, expected to return to pitching in a major league game soon after recovering from a torn lat muscle, noted his own karma problem. He refused to have an MRI in April for biceps soreness, and the lat issue emerged in his next start, resulting in months of recovery.</p>

<p>A Brazilian tennis player has apologized and been fined for making what appeared to be an offensive gesture during a Davis Cup match in Japan.</p>
<p>Guilherme Clezar was caught on camera mockingly stretching his eyes on Friday after he had successfully challenged a line judge’s call during the crucial third set of his clash with Japan’s Yuichi Sugita, per multiple reports.</p>
<p>See the racist move in this video.</p>
<p>After tennis fans around the world expressed their outrage, the 24-year-old player issued an apology on Saturday. He said he’d never intended to be “aggressive, racist” or “prejudiced” toward Asian people.</p>
<p>Clezar claimed to have “an excellent relationship” with other players in a statement shared on the Brazilian Tennis Confederation’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>“Even though I didn’t mean any prejudice, I recognize the gesture doesn’t ring true with the attitudes of respect, enthusiasm, solidarity, emotion and many other things that sport means to us,” he added, according to the BBC.</p>
<p>Clezar is currently ranked 244th in the world. He went on to lose the match in straight sets of 6-2, 7-5, 7-6.</p>
<p>The International Tennis Federation investigated the incident and decided to fine Clezar $1,500 for “unsportsmanlike conduct,” the BBC reports.</p>
<p>“The incident was reported after the match and the TV footage was then reviewed by the tie referee,” federation officials said in a statement. “Clezar issued a written apology. The ITF condemns all forms of offensive behavior.”</p>

<p>(Reuters) - The Cleveland Indians have the longest winning streak in Major League Baseball (MLB) in more than a century after their 3-2 extra innings victory over the Kansas City Royals on Thursday.</p>
<p>In earning their 22nd consecutive win, the Indians moved past the 1935 Chicago Cubs for the second-longest streak in MLB history.</p>
<p>Only the New York Giants (26) had a longer run of success but their remarkable 1916 stretch, which is recognized by MLB as the longest in major league history, included a tie.</p>
<p>Cleveland’s streak seemed destined to end at 21 games when they were down to their final out, trailing 2-1 in the bottom of the ninth, and down to their last strike.</p>
<p>But shortstop Francisco Lindor saved the day with a double to deep left field, which brought in a run and sent the game to extra innings.</p>
<p>Second baseman Jose Ramirez doubled with nobody out in the bottom of the 10th inning to set up the victory. After designated hitter Edwin Encarnacion walked, right fielder Jay Bruce sealed the deal with a walkoff RBI double as the home crowd broke into a frenzy.</p>
<p>“We had some opportunities and didn’t cash in but we kept playing,” Cleveland manager Terry Francona told reporters.</p>
<p>“That was a great atmosphere. It’s better when you win, but the experience for some of our young guys in incredible right now. They’re learning on the job right smack in the middle of this.”</p>
<p>Cleveland has dominated their opponents since their run began, a stretch during which every other American League team has lost at least eight games.</p>
<p>The Indians have outscored their opponents by a whopping 137-34 margin during the streak and have enjoyed top-notch pitching the entire way as well as a potent offense that has shown no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>Cleveland, which lost the decisive seventh game of last year’s World Series in extra innings, have the best record in the American League, 91-56.</p>

<p>If your child plays a contact or collision sport, whether at the youth, middle school or high school level, chances are they will suffer a concussion at some point in their athletic career. How quickly they recover may depend on how soon after injury – if at all – their concussion is identified so they can be removed from practice or game action. The problem is that concussion signs – still the best way to identify a concussion – are difficult to spot, and athletes often hide their symptoms. The consequences of such unreported and undiagnosed concussions range from a longer recovery up to and including, in rare cases, catastrophic injury and death.</p>
<p>One way to improve the chances that an athlete’s brain injury is identified is for teams to employ a “buddy” system in which team members are assigned to watch for signs of concussion in designated teammates and, if they spot signs, or if their teammates tell them they are experiencing symptoms, are encouraged or required to immediately report the possible injury to the athletic trainer or the coach.</p>
<p>While I had been advocating the use of a buddy system for many years in every sport, it was not until five years ago, during the taping of our PBS documentary, “The Smartest Team: Making Football Safer,” in Newcastle, Oklahoma that I began to truly appreciate not just how culturally entrenched was an athlete’s reluctance to self-report concussion symptoms but also the part a buddy system could play in changing that culture.</p>
<p>At a players-only meeting at the beginning of pre-season, and in interviewing athletes in small group and one-on-one, nearly every football player I spoke to freely admitted that they would not self-report concussion symptoms.</p>
<p>“If I can get up and walk away from it, yeah, I’ll probably keep playing,” one said.</p>
<p>“You see some dots and they go away ... so you just keep playing through it. It’s my senior year,” said another.</p>
<p>“As long as I can still see and keep my balance, as long as I’m not feeling dizzy, head injuries are all right,” acknowledged a third.</p>
<p>Typical was what one player told me: “There was a time that I’ve gotten a concussion. I didn’t think much of it, you know, just a headache, move on with it, keep playing. ... Got hit pretty hard, helmet to helmet, couldn’t see, saw stars everywhere, just went back on the field, started playing again. Didn’t need to tell anyone. I mean it’s not like I was laying down, couldn’t get up or anything. But I thought I was fine.”</p>
<p>(He wasn’t, of course, and should have told someone and removed himself, or been removed, from the game)</p>
<p>My anecdotal experience in Newcastle was that instituting a buddy system – not just players watching teammates but cheerleaders keeping an eye out for players showing signs of concussion – helped, although it’s hard to say how much. One of the players recounted how he had noticed a teammate who seemed really “out of it” at practice one day. When he told the coach, his teammate “got really mad.” But he said he was undeterred, because he “knew it was going to help [his teammate] in the long run.”</p>
<p>Another player told me that, “As far as the buddy system goes, I know that we need to keep each other’s backs, like me and Justin have each other’s backs as far as like, if I get a concussion or he had gotten a concussion, then you know, make sure he’s OK. If he’s out of it, you know, can’t answer simple questions, go alert the coaches. He got mad at me, but I learned it was the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>Given my experience in Newcastle, I was not surprised when, three years later, a 2015 study suggested that a buddy system, while it does not remove the need for honest self-reporting by athletes themselves or place final responsibility on teammates for each other’s health behaviors, may be an important step towards creating a culture of concussion safety on sports teams.</p>
<p>What I learned from working with the Newcastle team, and with youth football programs across the country over the years is that traditional concussion education in which athletes, coaches, and parents are taught the signs and symptoms of concussion, and the health risks of concussion and repetitive head trauma, isn’t working to change the concussion reporting behavior of athletes. Between 40 and 60 percent of all concussions ― and a much higher percentage of so-called “bell-ringer” events ― still go unreported; indeed, a recent study found that four out of 10 athletes with concussion signs or symptoms return to play that same day. It has become increasingly clear that the problem isn’t a lack of knowledge. Rather, it is the attitudes and beliefs of athletes about concussion reporting, what they think might happen to them if they report, and what they think are negative attitudes of coaches, teammates, parents, and fans about concussion reporting which combine to create a climate which discourages reporting.</p>
<p>In the age of social media, such negative attitudes by teammates about honest self-reporting can take the form of cyber-bullying and shaming. “As health care providers dealing with concussions, we need to be aware that many concussed patients may be bullied or shamed on social media by friends or teammates who may not believe that they are experiencing concussion symptoms, or that those symptoms are lingering,” notes Mark Halstead, M.D., a sports medicine physician and Director of the Washington University Sports Concussion Clinic & Young Athlete Center.</p>
<p>The answer, then, is to work to change attitudes about concussion symptom reporting so that honest reporting is viewed as a valued team behavior and a hallmark of a good teammate. Like the Centers for Disease Control and an increasing number of concussion experts, I believe that the best way to increase the rate at which athletes report concussion symptoms, either their own or their teammates, is for coaches, parents, medical staff to work as a team to change reporting behavior ― to reshape the culture around concussion reporting ― by changing individual and team reporting attitudes and norms and by creating a climate in which athletes feel comfortable reporting their symptoms.</p>
<p>The #TeamUp4ConcussionSafety™ freely available program, developed by MomsTEAM Institute as part of its SmartTeams Play Safe™ initiative with a Mind Matters Educational Challenge Grant from the National Collegiate Athletic Association and Department of Defense, is designed to do just that: to increase reporting by athletes of concussion symptoms by engaging coaches, athletes, parents, and health care providers in a season-long, indeed career-long program which emphasizes that immediate reporting of concussion symptoms – not just by athletes themselves but by their teammate “buddies” – not only reduces the risk the athlete will suffer a more serious brain injury – or, in rare cases, even death – but is actually helps the team’s chances of winning, not just in that game, but, by giving athletes the best chance to return as quickly as possible from concussion, the rest of the season, and by teaching that honest reporting is a valued team behavior and a hallmark of a good teammate.</p>
<p>The rate at which student-athletes immediately and honestly report experiencing concussion symptoms, both their own and their teammates, will only begin to increase if all stakeholders first understand how much they know about concussions, and about their own attitudes towards and beliefs about symptom reporting. Our five-part program begins by asking coaches, athletes, athletic trainers, and parents to take a series of quizzes designed to test their concussion knowledge, and, more importantly, whether they view concussion symptom reporting in a positive or negative light.</p>
<p>While knowledge and awareness of concussion has increased substantially over the seventeen years that MomsTEAM/SmartTeams™ has been engaged in concussion education, research shows that there are still important gaps that need to be filled. To fill them, coaches, parents, and athletes will be encouraged in Step Two in the #TeamUp4ConcussionSafety program to continue learning about concussions by taking our online concussion education course.</p>
<p>Because studies show that one-off concussion education isn’t enough to change concussion symptom reporting behavior, Step Three in the SmartTeams Play Safe™ #TeamUp4 ConcussionSafety™ game plan calls for coaches, athletes, athletic trainers, team doctors (and, at the youth and high school level, parents) to attend a mandatory concussion safety meeting before every sports season to learn in detail about the importance of immediate concussion symptom reporting, not just in minimizing the risks concussions pose to an athlete’s short- and long-term health, but in increasing the chances for individual and team success. (As I have learned from long experience with youth and high school sports programs, making attendance at a concussion safety meeting voluntary virtually guarantees a lot of no-shows.)</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence from NCAA Division I football programs suggests that the signing by athletes of pledges acknowledging their responsibility to report concussion symptoms increases the rate of reporting by athletes, both of their own symptoms and those of teammates. Because improving concussion safety requires a team effort, we believe that all those with a stake in concussion safety should sign pledges, not just athletes. Step Four of our concussion safety game plan thus calls for athletes, coaches, parents, and medical staff to demonstrate in a tangible way their commitment to creating a culture in which immediate reporting of concussion symptoms by athletes is a valued team behavior and the sign of a good teammate by signing a concussion safety pledge at or shortly after the pre-season concussion safety meeting,</p>
<p>And, finally, because prevailing attitudes towards concussion symptom reporting and reporting behavior are deeply entrenched in our sports culture, we encourage, as Step Five, that coaches, athletes, athletic trainers, team doctors, and parents continue working over the course of the sports season to create and maintain an environment in which athletes feel safe in immediately reporting concussion symptoms (both their own and their teammates) by sharing and reinforcing positive messages about the importance of immediate concussion symptom reporting via social media, by maintaining open lines of communication and an ongoing dialog about concussion safety among and between and among coaches, athletes, medical staff and parents.</p>
<p>With consistent messaging and constant reinforcement of the value of immediate concussion reporting in achieving your team’s performance goals, and by making athletes feel comfortable in reporting, we believe that, not only will attitudes and beliefs about concussion reporting begin to change, but the concussion reporting behavior of your athletes will start to change as well, and that, over time, the culture of resistance to concussion symptom reporting will be replaced by a sports culture of concussion safety.</p>

<p>The NFL season is just one weekend old ― but we already have a candidate for catch of the year.</p>
<p>Watch Cole Beasley of the host Dallas Cowboys make a juggling, one-handed reception that he manages to pin to the back of his shoulder to keep possession in Sunday’s game against the New York Giants:</p>
<p>Like NBC announcer Cris Collinsworth said, “Oh, my gosh.”</p>
<p>Now, watch it in slow motion:</p>
<p>“So far, that’s the top catch of the year,” fellow Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant told SportsDay.</p>
<p>Beasley’s catch was reminiscent of the dramatic receptions made by rival receiver Odell Beckham Jr., the Giants’ star who did not play in Sunday night’s game because of an injury.</p>
<p>“He’s not the only one who can catch footballs, I guess,” Beasley said of Beckham. “I never want to act surprised when I catch the ball ― that’s what you’re supposed to do.”</p>

<p>Football season has begun again, and already concussions have made news. This past Saturday during Labor Day weekend, the opening weekend for most college football teams, I happened to be at the University of Texas game against the University of Maryland. I was reminded, as was everyone watching the game at the stadium or elsewhere, just how violent the sport can be. A Maryland player sustained a head injury in the third quarter while trying to make a tackle. It knocked him out of the game.</p>
<p>Maryland cornerback Antwaine Richardson, a sophomore from Delray Beach, Florida, had to be carted off the field after a collision with Texas’ Lil’Jordan Humphrey. Richardson, who had already recorded six solo tackles in the game, suffered a head injury and lay motionless on the field for several minutes. He was eventually carted off the field and taken to a hospital, where he was responsive and moving, according to a Maryland spokesman who reported back. Richardson currently is in concussion protocol ― as he should be ― is listed as day-to-day, and is out for an undisclosed amount of time.</p>
<p>Maryland’s second-year coach, DJ Durkin, while happy about getting the program’s first win over a Top 25 team in seven years, had a decidedly serious tone at his news conference Tuesday when he confirmed just how severe several injuries were that were suffered not only by Richardson, but by quarterback Tyrrell Pigrome and linebacker Jesse Aniebonam. Durkin said that quarterback Pigrome would miss the rest of the season with a torn ACL of his right knee and that Aniebonam will be out “several months” with a fractured ankle.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, injuries are part of our game, and they happen,” Durkin said at his news conference.</p>
<p>A brain, a knee, an ankle ― from head to toe, the game of football can have a devastating effect on a body. Players accept that risk, coaches understand the risk and try to train players to use techniques that will help avoid injuries, and parents pray that their children will be lucky enough to avoid serious injury.</p>
<p>But there’s no denying that head injuries and concussions happen weekly across the country at every level of the game ― youth leagues, junior high or middle school, high school, college, and certainly the pros.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Frank Deford, the late, much-acclaimed sportswriter, wrote an article for National Public Radio on the subject entitled, “Mind Games: Football And Head Injuries.” In it, he said:</p>
<p>“It’s not just NFL football that is dangerous. If professional players, through the years, have suffered injuries — especially to their brains — players have also suffered football concussions in college, in high school and all the way down to youth football. In fact, of the nearly 5 million adolescents playing football below the college level, it’s estimated that half have sustained concussions, a third of them on multiple occasions — and the human brain is not fully developed until the mid-20s.”</p>
<p>The NFL, which began its 2017-2018 season Thursday night, has seen the incidence of concussions trending higher season after season. According to data collected and published in a graphic by Ohio University, there has been a 58 percent increase in concussions in regular-season NFL games just from 2014 to 2015. And a July article in the New York Times revealed that the brains of 110 out of 111 deceased former NFL players showed signs of CTE ― Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy ― a degenerative brain condition believed to be caused by repeated blows to the head. The cumulative effect of those blows is just beginning to be understood.</p>
<p>A blow to the head can lead to many types of injuries, as I point out in this video on Vimeo. A hard enough hit can cause a skull fracture; a hit can cause bleeding on the brain or even inside the brain; it can cause bruising to the brain, otherwise known as a concussion. If someone suffers an injury like this ― which can’t always conclusively be diagnosed with a CAT scan ― we look for symptoms such as dizziness, blurred vision, sensitivity to light, headaches, a feeling of being tired or feeling nauseous. One of the most important things to do if you suffer an injury like this is simply to rest. I knew one football player who got upended by a tackler when he went up for a pass and hit the field hard, landing headfirst. He suffered a concussion and couldn’t get out of bed for three days; he just stayed balled up under sheets and a blanket to try to block out the daylight because light hurt his head so much. No image scans revealed any injury, but he clearly was suffering.</p>
<p>There is definitely a heightened awareness around head injuries in football, and there are mandatory protocols to follow now at every level of the game. For example, at the NFL level, identification of a concussion includes some of the things that I reviewed in that video, such as loss of consciousness, balance problems, disorientation, blurred vision, a blank or vacant look, a clutching of the head or feeling sick to the stomach.</p>
<p>In the NFL, there are no fewer than 29 medical professionals at each game, at least one of whom (not affiliated with any NFL team) is assigned to watch the game specifically for signs of head trauma. Also, athletic trainers are used as spotters in each team’s booth, and they can review video to see if there were any plays in question that could potentially cause a concussion. They can call medical timeouts or have a player sidelined for evaluation.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also offers a booklet titled, “Get a Heads Up on Concussion in Sports Policies, which details what coaches, parents and others can do at their level to recognize and help treat someone with a head injury.</p>
<p>As I note on the title of the video in which I spoke on this subject, “Keep Your Inner Army Strong,” ― an overarching heath and wellness theme of mine ― an important part of concussion protocol includes knowing when to, and having the courage to, remove a player from competition due to a possible concussion. We can’t ignore this, perhaps the most devastating of all football injuries, particularly considering the cumulative effect this kind of injury could have over a player’s lifetime. Medical professionals cannot look away from head injuries or concussions because it might hurt the team to remove a player who shows these symptoms. A medical professional who makes that kind of a call in a game may end up being the most reviled person on the field if he or she benches a star player. We have to accept that, because we know it’s the right thing to do.</p>

Perry Wilson, MD MSCE, ContributorAssistant Professor of Medicine, Yale University">
<p>The first kickoff of the NFL season will take place tonight. The first tackle will not be far behind. During that event, the brain of both tackler and tackled will slosh against the inside of their respective skulls, setting in motion what might in many years culminate in a unique dementia syndrome that has resulted in the deaths of more than 100 NFL players to date.</p>
<p>It was dubbed dementia pugilistica by the great pathologist Harrison Martland in 1928 but came to be known as “punch-drunk syndrome” for the next eight decades. Today it is known by a different name, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopthy (CTE), and the poster child for the disease is no longer the scrappy pugilist taking his licks in the ring, but the football player taking hits on the gridiron.</p>
<p>CTE is a neurodegenerative disorder, meaning a condition in which brain cells die at an accelerated rate over time. Neurodegenerative disorders, like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, each have their own classic symptoms, but they often end the same way – in the death of the afflicted. CTE acts differently than other neurodegenerative disorders in that it is characterized not only by cognitive impairment but by significant and often disturbing changes in behavior and mood.</p>
<p>The suicides of several high-profile professional athletes, beginning with NFL player Terry Luther Long in 2005, brought CTE into the public consciousness. And with more attention, more cases came to light. Expanding quickly beyond football, cases of CTE appeared in virtually every contact sport: ice hockey, professional wrestling, rugby, even water polo. But despite a proliferation of cases, research into the mechanisms of this disease has only begun to reveal the true causes and potential effects. Despite almost a century of experience with the condition, the gaps in our knowledge are vast. Here’s what we still don’t know:</p>
<p>We Don’t Know How To Diagnose CTE Until It Is Too late</p>
<p>Examine a piece of normal brain under a microscope, and you will see a field of pinkish uniform material punctuated by darker blue islands in a pattern that looks a bit like banana bread. The pink background is made up of the thousands of tails (axons) of neurons, coursing together to send and receive signals throughout the body. The blue islands are the cell bodies of neurons and their supporting cells known as glial cells.</p>
<p>But examine the brain of someone with CTE, and a new pattern emerges. When revealed by a special stain, dense deposits and tangles of a protein called hyperphosphorylated tau appear inside the neurons. These tangles can appear anywhere in the brain, but seem to aggregate at the base of the brain sulci – the bottom of those wrinkles that give the human brain its distinctive character (and power). These tangles appear to disrupt the neuron and are associated with the eventual death of the cells as well. But whether the tangles are the initiating event that leads to cell death or a marker of a cell going awry for another reason is yet another mystery.</p>
<p>These examinations take place at autopsy. The risks of taking a piece of living brain to make a diagnosis are simply too high. Without a test for CTE that can be used in living individuals, research has been severely hamstrung.</p>
<p>Several scientists are working on this very issue. The most promising approach seems to be to use a special type of brain scan called positron emission tomography (PET). PET scans inject a radioactive tracer into an individual which is designed to bind to a specific substance in the body. One investigatory tracer binds to tau protein, allowing us to see the deposition of these tangles without removing a piece of brain from the body. But to confirm that these tests are valid, we’ll need to scan patients while they are alive and follow-up with the gold-standard autopsy-based test after death. This will take some time.</p>
<p>We Don’t Know Why Tau Goes Bad</p>
<p>Tau protein, in its normal form, is critical for neurons to function. It helps stabilize microtubules, the “railroad tracks” of axons which transport proteins to and from the cell body to the distant axonal tail. Tau is a highly soluble protein – it dissolves easily in water – when it is properly folded. But mi-fold the protein, and it starts to stick to itself. Multiple copies of tau amalgamate creating those characteristic tangles. These proteinaceous globules do not function as they are supposed to and in fact disrupt the functioning of the neurons themselves, perhaps leading to their death.</p>
<p>But what initiates this misfolding event? Tau protein deposition is a prominent feature in several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases. In CTE, greater tau deposition is linked to greater number of concussions and more years of football playing, suggesting that repeated trauma is a precipitating event, but without understanding the real link between trauma and tau, it is unlikely that an effective treatment will be developed.</p>
<p>We Don’t Know How Common CTE Is</p>
<p>A highly publicized study appearing in the Journal of the American Medical Association documented that 99 percent of donated brains from NFL players had pathology consistent with CTE. Less reported data from that study showed that 21 percent of the brains donated by high-school football players and 91 percent of those donated by college football players had evidence of the disease. At face value, these numbers are truly damning. It would be ethically untenable to allow football to continue if one out of every five high school kids who plays has clear evidence of brain damage.</p>
<p>But a phenomenon known as selection bias is at play here. These brains were donated precisely because the individuals showed concerning symptoms before they died. They were selected from the true population of football players in a non-random way. Imagine if we tried to calculate how many cars had dirty oil filters by examining them at a Jiffy Lube – we’d vastly overestimate the true rate.</p>
<p>But because diagnosis can only be made after death we are extremely limited in our sampling. The true prevalence of CTE in American Professional Football Players could be 0.4 percent on the low end, still concerning, but perhaps tolerable. But most researchers suspect the number to be much higher.</p>
<p>We Don’t Know If CTE Is Truly Distinct From Other Degenerative Diseases</p>
<p>Despite the publicity, reported cases of CTE are few and far between. Almost all the case series come from two labs run by expert pathologists. This has led some to suggest that perhaps CTE is not a true disease entity at all. Perhaps the football players were simply suffering from Alzheimer’s disease or another dementia, and these pathologists are reading too much into their history of playing sports.</p>
<p>Anne McKee, a pathologist at Boston University, has collected the largest series of patients with CTE in the world. She is the lead author of that famous “99 percent” paper. I asked her if her team had independent pathologists review her diagnoses. They had not, but she notes that a new consortium promises to do just that – have multiple, independent pathologists make diagnoses based on the same slides in order to determine the rate of agreement. A high rate of agreement will be compelling evidence that CTE is its own disease, distinct from the multitude of other neurodegenerative disorders.</p>
<p>We Don’t Know If New Safety Procedures Help</p>
<p>Football apologists are quick to point out that most of the individuals diagnosed with CTE played football in an “earlier era” where safety was not as big a concern. In modern football, players tackle differently, use different equipment, and are protected by new rules such as those that require a play to be ended if a player’s helmet comes off. But there is little evidence to suggest that any of these changes will make a difference.</p>
<p>A 2014 study appearing in the American Journal of Sports Medicine found similar concussion rates among high school football players regardless of the helmet brand used. Tackling technique may not matter much when, as this NFL study shows, even well-anticipated tackles (such as those that occur during a kick return) can result in concussion.</p>
<p>In the End, We Just Don’t Know If Football Is Safe</p>
<p>We are deep into the realm of motivated reasoning here. Many of us want football to be safe, because we love the sport. While professional players clearly understand that there are risks associated with playing, there is an ocean of difference between knee injuries, broken fingers and a chronic, debilitating and degenerative brain disease. And while professional players are at least compensated financially, the same cannot be said for college and high school players. Calls to ban youth football are rare but increasing. And they will increase more, I suspect, as the science around chronic head injury develops.</p>
<p>It is a defining feature of the enterprise of science to admit what we don’t know. It is also the tendency of scientists to maintain the status quo in the face of uncertainty. Under those conditions, awaiting more data before we engage in efforts to prohibit youth football seems appropriate and reasonable. But personally, I have my doubts. The answers to these questions are coming. When they are answered, will we look back at the decisions we make now with regret?</p>

<p>UCLA trailed Texas A&M by 34 points late in the third quarter Sunday night at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, giving Bruins fans the perfect excuse to leave early and beat the traffic.</p>
<p>But those who stayed were treated to an incredible rally.</p>
<p>Led by quarterback Josh Rosen, UCLA scored five unanswered touchdowns to shock A&M, 45-44, for the second-largest comeback in major college football history, CBS Sports reported.</p>
<p>Rosen threw four touchdown passes in the fourth quarter ― the last coming on a bit of trickery (see the clip above). He pretended he was about to spike the ball to freeze the defense, and then lofted a 10-yard touchdown to Jordan Lasley near the back of the end zone to tie the game at 44-44 with 43 seconds left. J.J. Molson’s extra point put UCLA ahead for good, 45-44.</p>
<p>“It was a lot of fun, huh? Glad you stuck around?” UCLA coach Jim Mora said, per Associated Press. </p>
<p>Highlights of the comeback begin around the 3:15 mark: </p>
<p>Rosen said: “We were an inch away from losing that game probably 10 times ... the things that had to go right to win this game were incredible.”</p>
<p>According to SB Nation, Michigan State overcame a 35-point deficit against Northwestern in 2006. The Bruins’ rally fell just one point short of that total, but it was historic nonetheless.</p>
<p>“It got real bleak at a certain point — real, real bleak,” Rosen told the Los Angeles Times.</p>

<p>What a way to end a losing streak.</p>
<p>LPGA veteran Stacy Lewis pledged last week to donate all her earnings from the Portland Classic to help Harvey-stricken Houston ― and she won the tournament by a stroke on Sunday to break a three-year victory drought, the Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>That means her $195,000 first-prize money is going to Harvey relief.</p>
<p>Here’s her original promise:</p>
<p>In a post-match interview, Lewis provided the kind of perspective that makes her a champion on so many levels. “We’re gonna help people rebuild houses and get their homes back and that’s more important than any win,” she says in the clip below. </p>
<p>Lewis joins Houston Texans star J.J. Watt ― who launched a relief fund that has drawn millions of dollars in donations ― among athletes leading the recovery effort.</p>
<p>“People wanted me to win this for Houston,” she said, per ESPN. “To do it when I added pressure to myself is a pretty good, pretty cool deal.”</p>

<p>This judge is definitely showing some bias.</p>
<p>Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a Bronx native, showed love for her hometown by dressing up in support of her home team on Thursday, when the New York Yankees played their arch-rivals, the Boston Red Sox. </p>
<p>Sotomayor showed up at Yankees Stadium in judicial robes to give some love to rookie Aaron Judge. </p>
<p>It’s pretty obvious why the justice was giving the Yankees newbie so much love. </p>
<p>Sotomayor’s support bolstered fan morale after the team lost its previous two games to the Cleveland Indians.</p>
<p>It was also a boost for Judge. The 25-year-old has been in a slump and has dropped in the batting lineup. </p>
<p>Judge began his first full season on the team at a great pace. Fans were instantly drawn to the power hitter’s repeated home runs. The outfielder led the American League with 37 home runs, but had a batting average of .181 going into Thursday’s game. </p>
<p>Maybe having America’s first Hispanic Supreme Court justice in his cheering section will lift Judge out of that rough patch. </p>

<p>Three NFL executives and one coach recently talked candidly, but requested anonymity, about Colin Kaepernick. They again hotly disputed the notion that Kaepernick isn’t unemployed because of his stance on the national anthem, because of his political activism, or because he would be a distraction. He’s not in the league, they again said, because he doesn’t fit in the offensive scheme that a particular team runs. It’s a football decision, pure and simple. The wrinkle this time is that the coaches and management who spoke about Kap got specific and named the teams that have been bandied about as possible fits for him, and then promptly ticked off the reasons why each of these teams passed on him. Again, the decision was purely football, and not fear and politics.</p>
<p>The NFL guys routinely back up their assertion that Kap is unemployed by endlessly saying 1) it’s a football decision, and 2) the NFL is not racist because it is overwhelmingly black with lots of black coaches and GMs. Many are making big bucks and often they make key personnel decisions. These are tough arguments to get around. But there’s actually a powerful refutation of this that takes the steam out of it. That’s by citing the NFL’s owners and the Commissioner’s own words.</p>
<p>New York Giants owner John Mara gave the first tip off in May. He minced no words when he said that he received tons of angry fan mail warning that if the Giants dared bring Kap in, they would pay dearly for it by a fan shutdown. Mara slightly walked it back months later by saying that he expected Kap to find a spot in the league at some vague, unspecified point in time. But Mara was careful not to imply that that spot would be on the Giants.</p>
<p>Next in the door was Baltimore Ravens owner, Steve Bisciotti. He said that the team was “sensitive” to the issue. Translated, that meant he was listening with a close ear to the fans who, as in New York, loudly said they didn’t want him on team. Team President Sam Bass doubled down on Bisciotti’s comments. He said that they were carefully monitoring fan reaction. Then there is Jacksonville Jaguar owner Shad Khan. He made news when he said that he was “open” to signing Kap. But he quickly added that the decision was ultimately up to the GM and the coach. Both were stone silent on what they thought of him. But Khan’s stated “openness” to signing Kap was just PR talk since he quickly punted the decision to others in his organization who had absolutely no interest in signing Kap.</p>
<p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, for his part, tried mightily to avoid saying anything about Kaepernick. When he was finally cornered on it he first fell back on the standard “it is a football decision” line. But in a far more revealing quip, Goodell made it clear that patriotism and support for the military were a big part of the NFL’s culture. He didn’t cite Kap as one who went against the grain of that. He didn’t have to. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones did that for him when he made clear that respect for flag and country were huge concerns for his team, “America’s team.” Jones spoke for many of the other NFL owners.</p>
<p>In the weeks since NFL camps officially opened, there have been Kap team signing rumors all over the place. In each case, it ignites the inevitable momentary flurry of chatter and speculation that Kap could finally find an NFL home. In each case, the talk quickly fizzles out after there is no invitation for a tryout, let alone a signing.</p>
<p>The owners and team managers are right, though, in one respect. Kap isn’t in the league, not because of any conspiracy or because the NFL is inherently racist. That’s why the NFL watchers can make the argument that with all the big-name, big-money (including, at one-time, Kap himself) black players in the league, you can’t call it racist that Kap isn’t playing. The answer lay in the NFL’s structure. It’s not a democracy, but a top down organization run by an entrenched, elite core of billionaire owners who set the tone and determine policy for the league. </p>
<p>The NFL power brokers have the supreme dominance to enforce their take it-or-leave-it imperium on the players, fans, and politicians. They don’t have to huddle behind closed doors and decide to keep Kap out of the NFL. It’s simply understood, a gentleman’s agreement if you will, that he’s not a fit for their league. This has nothing to do with on-the-field needs, and everything to do with the point that it is their league.</p>

<p>Colin Kaepernick’s prolonged unemployment has caught the attention of arguably the NFL’s best quarterback. </p>
<p>“I think he should be on a roster right now,” Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers told ESPN the magazine in an article posted Wednesday. “I think because of his protests, he’s not.”</p>
<p>Kaepernick has been unable to land a job since opting out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers in March. The move followed a tumultuous season for Kaepernick in which he refused to stand for the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. He sparked national debate and inspired other athletes to follow suit ― a trend that has continued into the NFL’s preseason following the violent clashes involving white supremacists in Charlottesville.</p>
<p>Kaepernick managed to have a pretty good season for a bad team, but NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has insisted Kaepernick isn’t being blackballed for for his demonstrations. He said all 32 teams have made a “football decision” to not sign him. Jesse Jackson, former NFL coach Tony Dungy and others would disagree ― as would the two-time NFL MVP-winning QB. Rodgers told ESPN it would be “ignorant” to believe that his former QB rival’s controversial stance hasn’t contributed to his unemployment.</p>
<p>As for his own opinion of the protests, Rodgers told ESPN: “I’m gonna stand because that’s the way I feel about the flag ― but I’m also 100 percent supportive of my teammates or any fellow players who are choosing not to.”</p>

<p>Art Briles was hired by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League today. I have been preparing for this day to come. Knowing the “football machine,” I didn’t think he would be blackballed in the same way that Kaepernick has been by the NFL ― and yes, that’s an intentional jab. I expected someone to hire Briles and I expected to be outraged along with most of the nation. What I didn’t expect is the shift in conversation around college coaching vs. professional coaching and America vs. Canada. Suddenly, I’m reading comments like “I have zero issue if a professional team wants to hire Art Briles”; “He just doesn’t belong on a college campus”; and “The Canadian league ― at least he’s not in the U.S. anymore.”</p>
<p>Here’s why this discussion is so upsetting to me. Yes, Art Briles is not in charge of impressionable young college men. He’s now in charge of adult men with jobs in the CFL. So, the threat of him influencing their minds in a negative way may be less, but it’s still there. There has been nothing to prove to me that Briles has changed his personal beliefs or attitudes that contributed to the mess at Baylor and he is still in a position of power and influence over these new players. Not to mention, and I think we can all agree, violence doesn’t just automatically become a non-issue in professional sports. How many stories about violence in the NFL riddle our social media timelines every day?</p>
<p>Let’s also not forget the influence Art Briles had on his coaching staff at Baylor ― grown men who should have known better. Does anyone really think that what happened on that football team had nothing to do with his coaching staff? Briles had help. He didn’t act alone and now his genius football brain along with his dangerous attitudes and beliefs are going to be influencing a new coaching staff of well-intentioned men.</p>
<p>Notice, I used the term “genius football brain.” I say this because he has a great offensive mind. He has proven he can turn a losing team into a winning one, but at what cost? Best case scenario, the Tiger-Cats start winning, but then what? Will greed, fame, and the addictive feeling of winning kick in so hard that they forget their moral compass? We saw it happen at Baylor. And once Briles is touted as the hero who turned around another losing team, won’t it only be a matter of time before he is back in a head coaching position? Maybe even at a college? It’s easy to see where this road goes.</p>
<p>And can we just talk about the survivors for a second? Briles supported, participated in, and helped cultivate an environment that allowed women to be raped. How is his influence any different at the professional level? How is his influence any different in Canada? All women matter. A woman’s worth should not be determined by her age and geographical location. Art Briles dismissed, minimized, and ignored violence against women at Baylor University in America and he can do it in Canada at the CFL.</p>
<p>Art Briles should not be coaching. He lost that privilege. We cannot allow ourselves to become desensitized to this issue. Survivors will struggle with their trauma for the rest of their lives. Art Briles does not deserve a second chance in football. His second chance is in the pursuit of redemption and becoming a better person. Rape survivors do not have the luxury of ever returning to “the life they once knew,” and neither should Art Briles.</p>
<p>The hiring of Art Briles by the CFL sends a strong message that they do not value the safety of women and that winning is more important than human life.</p>
<p>The hiring of Art Briles by ANY football organization will send the exact same message – it doesn’t matter if it’s a high school team, a college team, a pro team, or if it’s in America or Canada or Pakistan. The message is still the same… and it’s the wrong.</p>

<p>As the city of Houston grapples with the continued effects of Hurricane Harvey on Monday, the Houston Texans announced that the team is making a $1 million donation to United Way of Greater Houston Flood Relief Fund. </p>
<p>Soon after the team announced the decision, the NFL Foundation and Dallas Cowboys followed suit, each pledging to donate an additional $1 million to the relief fund.</p>
<p>The Texans announced the donation while preparing for the upcoming season at the Cowboys’ practice facility, where the team is practicing in anticipation of the upcoming season. But on Monday, the team’s focus was clearly back home.</p>
<p>“We’re just trying to do whatever we can from afar, ’cause we cant be there. We can’t be there physically,” said defensive end J.J. Watt, who launched his own fundraising effort on Sunday. “So we’re going to try and help raise that money.”</p>
<p>Quarterback Tom Savage offered similar sentiments. “It’s like a punch in the gut. You want to be back there for your family and for your city,” he told reporters. </p>
<p>The hurricane has left 300,000 without power since making landfall last Friday, leading first responders to rescue more than 2,000 people already. When all is said and done, the hurricane could pour 50 inches of rain over certain affected areas of the region. </p>
<p>As Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long put it, “Texas has never seen an event like this.”</p>

<p>J.J. Watt of the Houston Texans is tackling the disaster left by the catastrophic storm Harvey with the same passion he uses to pursue quarterbacks.</p>
<p>The star defensive end, stranded in Dallas Sunday because the team could not not return to flooded Houston from its preseason game in New Orleans the previous day, launched a YouCaring.com page and made a heartfelt plea for donors on social media, USA Today reported.</p>
<p>“I know that there’s going to be a whole bunch of people that we need to help get back on their feet,” he said. “I know there’s going to be a lot we need to do to help rebuild.”</p>
<p>Fans quickly raised the first $100,000 that Watt pledged to match. Four hours in, the website crashed but its CEO told the Texans it was increasing bandwidth to meet the demand, according to Sports Illustrated.</p>
<p>As of early Monday, donations had surpassed $290,000. </p>
<p>“Incredible to see so many people come together on this,” Watt told SI.</p>

<p>What does $1.5 billion look like? On Saturday night, Falcons fans finally got to find out. Matt Ryan, the MVP and all-everything quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons threw an interception on his team’s very first play – but that didn’t matter very much – the star of the show Saturday night was the sparkly new Mercedes Benz Stadium. After more than five years of preparation, the Falcons opened the door to their hugely anticipated stadium for the first time and the spectacle of the building buoyed any disappointment in what was happening on the field. </p>
<p>In the next few years, this building will host a Super Bowl, a College Football National Championship, and a Final Four. But tonight was just a pre-season game, a chance for fans, players and staff to fully bask in the ooohs and ahhhs before anything really counts. </p>
<p>Walking into the main gate of Mercedes Benz Stadium, you’re greeted with an expansive view of the field, surrounded by the one-of-a-kind Halo Board, 58ft tall and 360-degrees around. The three seating levels all offer something unique, whether it’s a 100-yard bar on the top level, a high-tech internet-friendly lounge on the second, or even a virtual reality racing experience on the bottom. In the background of it all is a glass-pane view of the Atlanta skyline. In short, it’s not a bad place to watch a game. </p>
<p>The cheap dining options, which made all sorts of news months before the stadium even opened, were all there, along with some local Atlanta favorites. And if you think Mercedes Benz Stadium wouldn’t also feature the world’s largest bird sculpture, you might want to think again. </p>
<p>For the Atlanta sports fan though, this whole new stadium thing is an old hat. The Braves opened their new Sun Trust Park just four months ago, and the Hawks are in the middle of the second largest arena renovation in NBA history. But there’s something different about Mercedes Benz Stadium. When the Braves packed up and moved from downtown Atlanta to a different county in the suburbs, it was a tough lesson in the fickle nature of sports business. So the joint investment between the city and its premiere team towards a billion dollar downtown stadium represents a future for Atlanta that includes the people who live in the heart of it. </p>
<p>Atlanta, of course, is not alone in the stadium wars. Starting with the famous Jerry World in Dallas a few years ago, it’s the norm for a new pro-stadium to cross the billion dollar threshold. And unfortunately, more often than not, it’s the taxpayer that has to take on an inordinate share of the burden. Mercedes-Benz Stadium is no different, $200 million of the building funds came from city money. But for the 70,000 fans that packed into the building on Saturday, most wearing huge grins and pointing camera phones in every direction, this one was worth it.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to marvel at, but its impact is just beginning to be felt. Mercedes Benz Stadium will bring Atlanta into the world stage in a way it hasn’t since the Olympics over twenty years ago. The city is apparently a finalist to be a host site for the 2026 World Cup, and it’s hard to imagine this stadium being turned down. So whether you watch Falcons games this year from your couch, or inside the building in the shadow of the world’s largest bird sculpture, you might want to get used to the stadium they’re playing. You’ll be seeing a lot of it.</p>

<p>Boxing legend Floyd Mayweather confused a lot of people when he showed up to what could be considered the biggest fight of his career in a ski mask.</p>
<p>Mayweather won after 10 rounds toe-to-toe with UFC Lightweight Champion Conor McGregor on Saturday night in what many called the fight of year.</p>
<p>But his outfit almost stole the show. </p>
<p>The main event, which took place in the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, was anticipated to be the highest-grossing fight in history due to years worth of bad blood between the men. McGregor began the feud in 2015 when, during an appearance on “The Conan O’Brien Show,” he said that a fight against Mayweather would be a “dance around the ring.”</p>
<p>But when Mayweather walked out in a black balaclava, everyone seemed to lose focus on the match. Maybe the boxer was trying to intimidate the younger fighter, or maybe it helped him keep his eyes on the prize.</p>
<p>Whatever Mayweather’s reasoning for the outfit, Twitter users certainly had some jokes. </p>
<p>It’s a good thing Mayweather won or the Internet might have never let him live this one down.</p>

<p> The Money Fight paid off. </p>
<p> Hyped for its novelty and spectacle, the bout between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and UFC star Conor McGregor materialized into a real fight ― and an entertaining one at that. </p>
<p> Mayweather beat the Irishman McGregor in Las Vegas Saturday by technical knockout in the 10th round to preserve his unblemished record. </p>
<p> “He’s a lot better than I thought he was,” Mayweather said. “He used a lot of angles. But I was the better man tonight. ... Our game plan was to take our time. … Then take him out at the end.” </p>
<p> “I thought it was close, and I thought the stoppage was a little early,” McGregor said. </p>
<p> “The ref should have let me keep going. I was just a little fatigued.” </p>
<p> Mayweather, who emerged from retirement at age 40 for the lucrative match and then declared himself retired again after the victory, improved to 50-0 to surpass heavyweight great Rocky Marciano’s 49-0 record for most wins without a loss or draw.  McGregor, 21-3 in mixed martial arts but making his pro boxing debut, appeared to defy his underdog status in the early rounds as the aggressor. Then fatigue and Mayweather’s experience caught up with him. In the 10th round Mayweather hit McGregor with a barrage of punches, prompting referee Robert Byrd to stop the fight.   After Mayweather’s lackluster victory against Manny Pacquiao more than two years ago, many boxing fans questioned whether this mega-fight would disappoint.    But boxing promoter Lou DiBella told HuffPost from the arena that boxing fans got what they wanted.    “Ultimately, we’re in the entertainment business,” DiBella said, “and this was a very entertaining fight. McGregor is a great athlete. But he was awkward. He was coming in from another discipline, and it showed.”   Former WBA lightweight champ Ray “Boom-Boom” Mancini told HuffPost that Mayweather’s skills have deteriorated with age.     “His hand speed wasn’t there,” Mancini said. “He was a step behind. But he has always been a smart fighter and he chopped McGregor down little by little and zapped him of his strength. It was clear that McGregor was in over his head, even though it was impressive how he went into it. He’s tough. He just isn’t a boxer.” “The fact that McGregor was so awkward in the ring probably made it even harder for Mayweather at first. But he figured it out. It was actually entertaining to watch.” DiBella said Mayweather may want to think twice before stepping into the ring again. “He is done and he knows it. He’s a great businessman/fighter. But we’ve seen the last of him.”    Reuters contributed to this report.   </p>

<p>  Floyd Mayweather gave UFC champion Conor McGregor a lesson in the ring on Saturday during the most hyped boxing match of the year.  The Michigan native defeated McGregor in the 10th round with a technical knockout, keeping Mayweather’s perfect record in mint condition. Though there was intense exchanges of insults between McGregor and Mayweather in the weeks before the match, the two fighters hugged after Mayweather secured his win.

<p>After defeating UFC champ Conor McGregor during their much-hyped Saturday night fight in Las Vegas, undefeated boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. said he was hanging up his gloves — “for sure” this time. </p>
<p>“This was my last fight tonight. For sure. Tonight was my last fight,” Mayweather, 40, said at the conclusion of the unexpectedly competitive bout, according to Rolling Stone. “Tonight I chose the right dance partner to dance with. Conor, you are a hell of a champion.” </p>
<p>McGregor, who had never fought in a professional boxing match until Saturday, had surprised — and impressed — fans and pundits with his strong showing early on in the fight. The mixed martial arts fighter, however, started to languish as the bout drew on.</p>
<p>Mayweather won by technical knockout in the 10th round. The win means the boxer, who earned at least $100 million from Saturday’s fight, will retire with a 50-0 professional record.</p>
<p>As SB Nation notes, this isn’t the first time Mayweather has retired, having done so twice before — first in 2007 and then in 2015.</p>
<p>Mayweather insists this time’s the real deal, but some fans aren’t quite so convinced. </p>

<p>Five players and three coaches were ejected from Thursday night’s baseball game between the Detroit Tigers and New York Yankees when a brawl at home plate cleared both benches and sparked continued tension throughout the final three innings.</p>
<p>The clash began in the fifth inning when Tigers pitcher Michael Fulmer hit Yankees star Gary Sanchez. In the sixth, Yankees pitcher Tommy Kahnle threw a pitch behind Tigers star Miguel Cabrera, which prompted the ejection of Kahnle and Yankees manager Joe Girardi, who argued the umpire’s decision to eject his pitcher.</p>
<p>Just as the game was about to resume, Cabrera began exchanging words with Yankees catcher Austin Romine. The conversation quickly escalated as Romine removed his mask and Cabrera got in a shove. The two started rolling around on the ground as they punched each other. Soon both benches cleared as players joined the fray.</p>
<p>Yankees players were also shown running in from the bullpen. </p>
<p>Video from the brawl showed Sanchez punching Cabrera, a move that could get him suspended from future play even though he was not one of the five players ejected Thursday. </p>
<p>“I was in the dugout; I looked up, and I saw Romine rolling on the ground with the other guys,” Sanchez told The New York Times through an interpreter. “In that moment, instinct takes over because you want to protect your teammate. That’s your family out there.”</p>
<p>The bad blood continued. Two more players would get hit at bat, and the benches would clear two more times before the final out of the game. The Yankees lost, 10-6.</p>
<p>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the Detroit baseball team as the Lions on one reference.</p>

<p>The trash talk had already turned downright offensive. Now it just took a turn for the absurd.</p>
<p>In remarks before his fight against Floyd Mayweather Jr. on Saturday in Las Vegas, Conor McGregor called the boxer’s strip club a “crack den.”</p>
<p>Praising his own business acumen, the UFC lightweight champion McGregor then criticized Mayweather’s recent opening of the Girl Collection.</p>
<p>“That strip club is bleeding money from him and he knows it,” McGregor said on Wednesday in a video posted by MMA Junkie. “And he’s talking about franchising it and the thing looks like a crack den.”</p>
<p>“And that’s no disrespect to the people that are in there,” he added. (He took a few other shots at the club. See them below at the 2:30 mark.)</p>
<p>The comments about the club, while potentially insulting to employees, may hit closer to home for Mayweather than one might think.</p>
<p>He has frequently promoted Girl Collection on Twitter, even as the buildup toward the fight began to peak. He is even expected to to hang out there the night before the ballyhooed showdown.</p>
<p>Mayweather, who has an alarming history of violence against women, explained to Jimmy Kimmel earlier this month that he opened the club because “breasts, vaginas, music and alcohol will never go out of style.”</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>

<p>ESPN provoked controversy and mockery this week for pulling Robert Lee, an Asian-American sportscaster, from a college football game in Charlottesville, Virginia. But the company insists it made the decision out of concern for its employee’s well-being — and not because of political correctness.</p>
<p>CNN’s Brian Stelter obtained a memo from ESPN President John Skipper saying there had never been “any concern ... by anyone at any level” that Lee’s name ― which he shares with the Confederate general whose statue was the focal point of this month’s white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville ― “would offend anyone.”</p>
<p>Instead, Skipper said production staff were worried that Lee’s assignment to cover a Sept. 2 University of Virginia football game “might create a distraction or even worse, expose him to social hectoring and trolling.”</p>
<p>Lee had personally expressed some “trepidation about the assignment,” Skipper added in the memo, posted on the sports broadcaster’s internal website.</p>
<p>ESPN had shared a similar defense on Tuesday, when its controversial decision about Lee was first reported by Clay Travis, editor of the website Outkick the Coverage.</p>
<p>“We mutually agreed to switch,” an executive at the sports channel told HuffPost contributor Yashar Ali in a statement, referring to Lee. “No biggie until someone leaked it to embarrass us and got their way.”</p>
<p>Travis, a Fox News contributor who has condemned ESPN on several other occasions for what he has deemed liberal bias, said on his website that “multiple Outkick fans inside ESPN” had leaked the Lee news to him.</p>
<p>People on social media had mixed reactions to ESPN’s latest statement on the issue. Some accused the channel of throwing Lee “under the bus,” while others said they were unconvinced by the explanation. </p>
<p>Some called for ESPN to stick to sports, rather than delving into politics. Others said the attention and media coverage on the matter had gone out of control.</p>
<p>A few, however, said ESPN’s explanation did make sense, though some noted that the channel could’ve been handled the situation better.</p>
<p>Lee himself has remained mum amid the controversy. The sportscaster has not responded to HuffPost’s requests for comment.</p>

<p>A group of boxing doctors gave a prognosis for Conor McGregor ahead of his megafight against Floyd Mayweather Jr. on Saturday in Las Vegas ― and it isn’t a promising one.</p>
<p>The Association of Ringside Physicians, which consists of more than 100 doctors, told The New York Times that McGregor is overmatched and they are afraid “somebody’s going to get really hurt.”</p>
<p>“We were very surprised this bout was even sanctioned and was going to be permitted to carry on,” the group’s president, Dr. Larry Lovelace, said. “The thing I really fear, truly fear, is that somebody’s going to get really hurt in this upcoming fight.”</p>
<p>But Bob Bennett, executive director of the fight’s sanctioning body, the Nevada State Athletic Commission, hit back, telling the NYT that McGregor is “the taller, longer, stronger, more powerful opponent. He’s also a southpaw, which makes it a little more difficult for a conventional fighter. He’s 12 years younger than Floyd.”</p>
<p>So is McGregor truly in danger?</p>
<p>Well, McGregor doesn’t think so. See his prediction here:</p>
<p>But if we’re talking boxing experience, perhaps he isn’t safe. McGregor, 21-3 as a mixed martial artist in the UFC and now the organization’s lightweight champion, has never fought in a professional boxing match. Meanwhile, Mayweather has a record of 49-0 as a pro boxer. Earlier this month, leaked video appeared to show McGregor knocking down sparring partner Paulie Malignaggi, a former welterweight star in boxing, perhaps to ease doubts about his inexperience ― but that also served to tick off Malignaggi.</p>
<p>In terms of age and rust, Mayweather hasn’t fought in nearly two years and he is indeed by far the elder of the pugilists, 40 to McGregor’s 29.</p>
<p>Oddsmakers are siding with the docs, though. It takes approximately a $400 bet to win $100 if you’re wagering on Mayweather (as Mayweather reportedly is), according to Bleacher Report. </p>

<p>ESPN confirmed Tuesday it removed Asian-American announcer Robert Lee from a college football game in Charlottesville, Virginia, because he shares a name with Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.</p>
<p>It was a Charlottesville rally to preserve a statue of Lee that touched off violent protests involving white supremacists earlier this month. The fallout includes a bitter national debate about the fate of Confederate statues.</p>
<p>Here’s Lee on the right:</p>
<p>So, Lee, who was scheduled to cover the University of Virginia’s home game against William and Mary on Sept. 2, has been reassigned to a game in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Some outlets quickly criticized the move as political correctness to the extreme. But in a statement to HuffPost contributor Yashar Ali, the network said it had practical reasons for its action: fearing that its employee would be subject to an avalanche of memes, jokes and other unwelcome publicity. </p>
<p>Lee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Still, one well-known ESPN veteran with a similar name couldn’t resist a dig.</p>

<p>A Spanish swimmer gave up his chance of glory at an international competition when he paid tribute to the victims of the deadly Barcelona and Cambrils terror attacks.</p>
<p>Fernando Álvarez, 71, was reportedly refused his request for an official minute’s silence at the FINA World Masters Championships in Budapest, Hungary, over the weekend.</p>
<p>So he decided to hold his own.</p>
<p>As video that is going viral shows, he remained on the starting block after the buzzer sounded for the start of his 200-meter breaststroke heat on Saturday.</p>
<p>Álvarez stood on the block for a full 60 seconds before diving in to join the race, albeit a minute behind.</p>
<p>FINA recorded him as finishing the event with “no time” on its official website.</p>
<p>But the swimmer said it was something he felt compelled to do.</p>
<p>“It’s something that has affected us all, but maybe because of the distance and the because I have family there,” he told the El Español news website.</p>
<p>“I stayed alone. I left a minute later. But I do not care, I felt better than if I won all the gold in the world,” Álvarez added.</p>
<p>His swimming club, Club Natación Cádiz, shared footage of the tribute to Facebook on Saturday. It’s since garnered more than 600,000 views.</p>
<p>In another post, the club praised Álvarez for putting “values above everything” and described him as a “great example for our swimmers.”</p>

<p>This controversial armchair quarterback says he benched himself.</p>
<p>New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie on Sunday disputed a report that New York sports radio station WFAN removed him as a candidate to replace iconic host Mike Francesa.</p>
<p>The governor, who has filled in at the station and was known to be in line for a possible full-time gig, told outlets in a statement that he was the one who pulled the plug on his jock-talk prospects.</p>
<p>“After considering the other options that I have been presented with for post-gubernatorial employment, I declined their request to do additional shows,” Christie said. “I made station executives aware that while I would be happy to continue to fill in ... when available, that they should no longer consider me as a candidate interested in any job at WFAN when I leave the governorship. I made that clear to them prior to leaving for my family vacation two weeks ago.”</p>
<p>Citing anonymous sources from WFAN, the New York Daily News on Saturday reported that the station gave Christie the boot from consideration after Francesa is expected to leave in December. The station had earlier indicated interest in the governor.</p>
<p>Christie recently made news for a run-in with a fan at a Milwaukee Brewers game.</p>
<p>Looks like he’ll be having fewer on-air conflicts with fans such as “Mike from Montclair” as well.</p>

<p>Kevin Durant told ESPN that he’s been dreaming of bringing the Larry O’Brien Trophy to the White House as an NBA champion since he was a kid. But if President Donald Trump invites the Golden State Warriors star and his teammates to celebrate their 2017 championship, he won’t be in attendance. </p>
<p>Speaking with ESPN’s Chris Haynes, Durant said he’d make his voice heard by not accepting an invitation to visit the president. </p>
<p>“I don’t respect who’s in office right now,” the finals MVP said. “I don’t agree with what he agrees with, so my voice is going to be heard by not doing that.”</p>
<p>Trump has not formally invited the Golden State Warriors to the White House, and Durant suspects his teammates would also not want to go if asked. </p>
<p>“That’s just me personally, but if I know my guys well enough, they’ll all agree with me,” he added. </p>
<p>Durant wouldn’t be the first athlete to publicly denounce the president. When the New England Patriots visited the White House to celebrate their 2017 Super Bowl win, six players said they would not attend for political reasons. In December, a group of Cleveland Cavaliers players, including LeBron James, opted not to stay at a Trump-branded hotel that the team had booked as accommodation while they were in New York playing against the Knicks. Other NBA teams, including the Milwaukee Bucks, Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks, said they would not book accommodation at Trump hotels to “avoid any implied association” with the president.</p>
<p>Durant said during his ESPN interview that he believed Trump’s time in office had escalated racial tensions in the U.S.</p>
<p>Trump said after last weekend’s white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that there had been some “very fine people on both sides,” as he defended his response to the violence.</p>
<p>Durant called the events that unfolded after the protest “unfathomable.” </p>
<p>“If we have someone in office that doesn’t care about all people, then we won’t go anywhere as a country,” he said. “In my opinion, until we get him out of here, we won’t see any progress.”</p>

<p>Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch appeared to take a page out of Colin Kaepernick’s playbook and not stand for the national anthem before Saturday night’s preseason game against the Arizona Cardinals.</p>
<p>He was photographed sitting on a cooler and holding a banana, prompting memories of last season when then-49ers quarterback Kaepernick sparked a national debate over his anthem demonstrations to protest racial injustice and police brutality.</p>
<p>Lynch didn’t address his move, but the San Francisco Chronicle’s Scott Ostler wrote in a Sunday column that he should.</p>
<p> “It would be nice if he clues us in, because sitting out the national anthem is a big deal. While waiting for word from Planet Marshawn, here’s my wild guess: The sit-down wasn’t unintentional or accidental. Lynch has a distinctive style. He runs hard into people on the field, and he runs hard into authority off the field, and he makes no apologies. If he is protesting, here’s one thing I would like to know: Lynch’s sit-down took place a few hours after the violent ugliness in Charlottesville, Va., and after the president of the United States declined to condemn the hate groups responsible for the deadly violence. Is Lynch protesting that violence? Is he protesting in support of Colin Kaepernick, who remains unemployed even though NFL teams are now signing backup quarterbacks from beach pickup games? If Lynch chooses not to explain his sit-down, he surrenders any power a protest might have.” </p>
<p>Raiders coach Jack Del Rio relayed an exchange with Lynch after the game. “He said, ‘This is something I’ve done for 11 years — it’s not a form of anything other than me being myself,’ ” Del Rio said, per the San Jose Mercury News. “I said, ‘So you understand how I feel, I very strongly believe in standing for the national anthem, but I’m gonna respect you as a man. You do your thing, OK, and we’ll do ours.’ ”</p>
<p>Pro Football Talk disputed the claim that sitting was a longtime habit of Lynch ― but a stronger clue of where he stands (or doesn’t stand) on the issue was a September interview with Conan O’Brien in which he expressed support for Kaepernick’s move.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett made clear his motives for not standing for the anthem in Sunday’s exhibition game against the Los Angeles Chargers. Bennett said it would be the start of a season-long protest against intolerance. “I hope that I can activate everybody to get off their hands and feet and go out into the communities and push helping each other,” he said, per NFL.com.</p>

Daniel Carter and Katherine Redmond Brown, Contributors">
<p>The NCAA Board of Governors announced on Thursday they adopted a new sexual violence policy. The policy, adopted after a recommendation from the Commission to Combat Campus Sexual Violence, requires college athletes and administrators to annually complete sexual violence education.</p>
<p>While the NCAA announced this policy to fanfare, it merely follows what is already required under the federal Jeanne Clery Act (which includes nearly $55,000 per violation fines for colleges that violate the requirement), and more is required for there to be true accountability for violent behavior in collegiate athletics. What it doesn’t contain is enforcement or accountability that approaches penalties reaching the level as the purchase of a hamburger for a student-athlete.</p>
<p>The school president or chancellor, athletics director and Title IX coordinator will be required to annually attest that the education was conducted. This provides slightly more accountability than the Clery Act, amended by the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, which merely requires that all incoming students and employees receive sexual violence education, and that there be ongoing educational campaigns. It, however, is far short of the types of reforms that both of us, and other advocates, have been seeking for several decades.</p>
<p>This policy was approved by the NCAA Board of Governors, representatives from conferences who are either presidents or chancellors. Concerning is whether these Board of Governors, overseeing major national universities, did not know that this policy simply mirrors existing federal policy or they did know and passed it off as groundbreaking because the general population do not know what the Clery Act is.</p>
<p>The NCAA was lobbied in 2010 to address sexual assault and domestic violence by emulating the standards in Title IX and adding accountability. When female athletes have become victims of male athletes, then the NCAA should absolutely have a policy as the governing body of all student-athletes. In fact, collegiate athletic conferences have chosen to take steps much more effective than the NCAA, such as a transfer policy and denying entrance to athletes investigated for sexual assault or domestic violence.</p>
<p>The NCAA doesn’t have a policy that would have addressed the allegations of violence against Ezekiel Elliott during his time at Ohio State, leaving it to the NFL to act now. But, the NFL is an employer. The NCAA has an unpaid labor force.</p>
<p>The NCAA says it cannot be a state actor, a status the NCAA has fought for in NCAA v. Tarkanian all the way to the Supreme Court, but remains debatable given other state athletic association rulings and the NCAA’s own investigations into Penn State and Montana. In fact, the NCAA’s “lack of institutional control” infraction should be cited by the NCAA for a program, like Baylor, who has shown exactly that. They could have used it in the new “policy” as an enforcement measure. They didn’t.</p>
<p>At the very least, when a collegiate athlete has been found responsible for or convicted of an act of violence they should lose their privilege to compete on behalf of their institution. Competing, and serving as an ambassador of the institution, is an honor and a privilege that is not deserved by those who commit senseless violence. Of course now if a student athlete leaves one school they can simply transfer to and play for another institution, unless they are one of the institutions or are in one of the conferences that banned transfers or incoming freshmen athletes with a violent history. That’s leadership.</p>

<p>Imagine your husband hanging from the rafters in the garage, or your father dead in a barn outside his home. Let’s say he played football decades ago in high school or college, never sniffed the NFL. Then he got a job, raised a family. But the game caught up with him, and now he’s one of its faceless casualties.</p>
<p>The issue of concussions in football wouldn’t seem so abstract anymore, would it?</p>
<p>Michael King was a beloved doctor in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, known in the community for his interest in sports medicine. Michael’s son, Alex King, would sometimes tag along on patient visits when the boy was 5 or 6 years old, and remembers his father’s compassion. </p>
<p>“Once we met an 80-year-old woman who was 200 pounds overweight, and he held her hand, joked with her, kissed her on the forehead,” says Alex, now 29. “And I saw that sort of thing many times.”</p>
<p>Michael was a quarterback in high school, and he went on to play at Division-III Hampden-Sydney College. Susan DeRamus, Michael’s wife of nearly 30 years, first met Michael just after college. He was a strapping former athlete. She was working at Montaldo’s, a store in Greensboro, North Carolina, when Michael’s mother and sister came in shopping for bridesmaid dresses. Susan overheard Michael’s mother say that the wedding was at a Catholic church, and blurted out, “Where in the hell did you find a Catholic boy? I can’t find one anywhere.”</p>
<p>“I happen to have two sons,” the mother said, and invited Susan to the wedding. Her first impression of Michael was strong. “He was just so handsome,” she remembers. At the wedding, Susan caught the bouquet, and she and Michael were married nine months later, in July 1973.</p>
<p>Their first decade together was marked by hope for the future, as Michael worked hard to launch his medical career and the couple started a family. Michael always maintained a deep affinity for student athletes. Alex remembers it was common for the family to be eating dinner while his father examined a local football player, the young man’s leg propped up on the kitchen counter between the plates and forks.</p>
<p>But as the years passed, Michael gradually became more irritable, short with his wife and tough on his four children ― sons Alex and Mike, and daughters Katie and Marylynn.</p>
<p>“There would be times when he would be a sweet man, a giving man, very humble and kind,” Alex says. “And there were times when he would totally flip the script and be volatile and angry.”</p>
<p>A Quiet Killer</p>
<p>Late last month, a study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association grabbed headlines with a startling statistic: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, was discovered in 110 of the 111 former NFL players whose families donated their brains to the Boston University School of Medicine. The disease, caused by head trauma, leads to dementia, memory loss, suicidal thoughts, and personality and mood changes, among other progressive symptoms.</p>
<p>The New York Times ran a two-page spread with photos and blurbs about the players; since then, stars from Ben Roethlisberger to Boomer Esiason have discussed CTE with a frankness that would have been unimaginable just a few years ago.</p>
<p>But absent from the ensuing soul-searching and regret were the names and lives behind the other numbers in the study. The figures were less publicized, but are more relevant to average Americans: CTE was found in the brains of 3 of 14 high school players (21 percent), and 48 of 53 college players (91 percent). The study also showed high rates of CTE among semi-professional and Canadian Football League players.</p>
<p>“How do you go from an incredibly intelligent, personable, kind, loving, funny ― all around just a great guy ― to so much mental anguish and pain you hang yourself in the garage?” wrote Kathy Grant, whose husband, Peter Grant, died in 2011, in a bio for a 2016 Boston University CTE event. Peter sustained seven known concussions as a high school football and hockey player, and played intramural sports while attending Notre Dame in the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Kathy remembers her husband’s downward spiral, beginning in 2009: One parents weekend at Notre Dame, the school all three of their children attended, Peter was so depressed that he could barely come out of the hotel room. Another time at the kitchen table back home, Peter became agitated and hurled a laptop across the room, smashing it against the wall. Other times he was confused or suicidal.</p>
<p>On Feb. 8, 2011, Peter hanged himself in the family garage. He was 49.</p>
<p>Kathy donated his brain to Boston University for concussion research, and Peter was posthumously diagnosed with CTE.</p>
<p>The NFL responded to the recent JAMA report by pointing out that the study’s sample came from brains families had donated ”because of the players’ repeated concussions and troubling symptoms before they died.”</p>
<p>A league spokesperson told HuffPost that ”the issue of player health and safety is extremely important to the NFL and we are always looking at how we can make our game safer.”</p>
<p>Some fans point to the prospect of fame and big-money contracts as trade-offs for the brutal health risks of the game. Yet the vast majority of those hurt by the sport never get close to cashing in. Instead, they’re left with ruined lives and haunted families.</p>
<p>A Family Tradition</p>
<p>Even though he never played professionally, Michael’s life was marked by injuries from his football days. “He was so physically debilitated because of all of his injuries from football,” says Mike King, now 38. “He had both knees replaced at different times. He had both shoulders replaced. I believe he had a hip replacement. He had severe rheumatoid arthritis that had gradually worsened to the point where the knuckles on his hand were giant, and the last few years of his life he couldn’t operate any more.”</p>
<p>Michael was clear about one thing: He didn’t want the boys playing football. Mike wasn’t interested in the game, but Alex was. He wanted to emulate and connect with his dad. So he insisted on playing, and ended up a quarterback himself in middle and high school. </p>
<p>Alex’s injuries mounted from the beginning; Mike recalls one time when his brother was pushed out of bounds, and his helmet came off as his head crashed into the bleachers. The family was relieved when Alex switched from quarterback to punter to play at Duke University, where he excelled and thought he might even be drafted by an NFL team. But even that safer position left his brain vulnerable to damage.</p>
<p>“Just because you don’t play quarterback doesn’t mean you don’t get concussions,” Alex says. “When you’re a punter, you’re a sitting duck running down the field. And if you don’t do a good enough punt and it gets returned, you’re the most blockable person on the field. And I got leveled several times. The game is dangerous no matter what position you play.”</p>
<p>‘The Definition Of Child Abuse’</p>
<p>Each year, approximately 1,700 men make NFL rosters, but that is a tiny fraction of how many Americans play football. A spokesperson for the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, a trade organization that collects data on sports participation, told HuffPost that 5.5 million people ages 6 and up participated in tackle football in 2016, a number that includes youth, high school, college and post-college.</p>
<p>But should these children and adults be playing at all? It really worth the risk, if there is chance a player could end up declining in middle age like Michael King or Peter Grant?</p>
<p>To Dr. Bennet Omalu, the man credited with discovering CTE, the answer is simple: no. He recently equated youth football to child abuse.</p>
<p>“Someday there will be a district attorney who will prosecute for child abuse [on the football field], and it will succeed,” Omalu said at an event in New York. “It is the definition of child abuse. If you play football, and if your child plays football, there is a 100 percent risk exposure.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for USA Football, the national governing body for amateur football in America, told HuffPost in a statement that it supports research to promote sport safety, and incorporates “evidence based practices into our programs.”</p>
<p>“As a result, our programs are supported by leading medical organizations and recognized for advancing player safety and coaching education,” it said.</p>
<p>USA Football works in conjunction with the NFL, which funds the development and implementation of player safety techniques. In 2015, USA Football released new tackle football practice guidelines, including “clear definitions of contact and time limits on full player-to-player contact,” the NFL spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Sometimes when she’s out on a run near her home, Kathy Grant sees small children at football practice. “They’re little, probably 6 or 7,” she says. “I want to say to their mothers and fathers who are sitting around talking with each other while the kids are playing ― just like we used to do ― I just want to just go up to them and say, ‘My God, don’t let them get hit.’”</p>
<p>‘Deep Depression And Hopelessness’</p>
<p>Susan and Michael divorced in 2001. In the coming years, his decline would accelerate. “He was weepy, and you could see his eyes were sort of sunken,” Mike says. “Redness around the eyes. There was this overall aura and physical appearance of deep, deep depression and hopelessness.”</p>
<p>Once, when Alex was playing for Duke and the team took a tough loss, Susan noticed Michael sitting alone in the bleachers, head in hands, sobbing. “It was just not normal for a grown man to cry about a football game like that,” she says. </p>
<p>In October of 2011, Mike became so concerned that he decided to drive from the Washington, D.C. area, where he worked as an attorney, to check on his father in North Carolina. He planned to head south on the evening of Friday, Oct. 7.</p>
<p>But early that morning, Michael walked into a barn near his house and used a rope to hang himself.</p>
<p>His family donated his brain for the Boston University study. It confirmed what they had always suspected: Michael had CTE.</p>
<p>Speaking Out</p>
<p>Talking about their dad evokes heavy sighs and tears. But Michael’s family wants to speak out to raise awareness among fellow football-loving families. This game can destroy the Everyman just as easily, if not more so, than the celebrity athlete.</p>
<p>In the years since his death, Michael’s family has tried to cope with the loss by reminding themselves that their father had a degenerative disease; had he lived, he would only have suffered more. Driven by Michael’s passion for sports medicine, the family started the Dr. Michael E. King Memorial Scholarship for student athletes. All four siblings are involved in CTE awareness or policy advocacy efforts. Marylynn is a physical therapist in Seattle, where she cares for patients who are recovering from traumatic brain injuries, spinal injuries, amputations and other severe injuries.</p>
<p>As they find ways to ensure their father’s legacy is consistent with his service to athletes, the Kings wonder about their youngest brother’s future. Alex does not want to say whether he fears CTE himself ― but Mike can’t help but worry when he thinks how much time his brother spent playing football, including Alex’s college career.</p>
<p>“There’s evidence that certain people can be predisposed to CTE,” Mike says, his voice wavering. “And if we know that our dad got it and was Stage 2 by the time he was 65 and died, to some degree it might run in our family, at least if you’re exposed to these risk factors. So yeah, I ... think about it for Alex, potential long-term problems. I’ve always been concerned about my little brother.”</p>
<p>Alex is more garrulous, but drifts into the same tone at times, pausing ― nearly halting altogether ― over his words when discussing his dad.</p>
<p>Speaking of her late husband, Susan broke into sobs. “My kids now are remembering a lot of great things, but there is a lot of pain,” she says. “It’s very frightening to see a spouse change, and you think, ‘Oh my God, this guy is nuts, the things he says, it just doesn’t make sense. It’s a little off.’ Michael had an issue with anger, and I think the CTE brought that out.” </p>
<p>“My dad would tell you, he was a regular Joe,” says Mike. “And the scary thing, or the scariest aspect of this CTE problem, may be that there are millions, if not tens of millions of athletes who have played a contact or collision sport.”</p>

Storyteller. Lawyer.">
<p>A Little Introduction: I am a true Seahawks fan. I’ve lived through the good, the bad and the ugly—from Curt Warner (yay!) to The Boz (ouch!) to Rick Mirer (good gawd) to finally winning a Super Bowl with the still awesome Legion of Boom. Hell, I didn’t even trip when the Seahawks made the boneheaded decision to throw the ball on the one-yard line instead of giving it to Beastmode because, hey, we just won a Super Bowl last year. Can’t be greedy. Sure, the TV somehow broke when I threw the remote at it when the interception happened, but y’know, I’m cool.</p>
<p>Point: I love me some football; especially the Seahawks. It’s easy for me to whittle Sundays away between watching games on TV and checking fantasy football scores. Right alongside my love for professional football and the Seahawks is my love for social justice, equity and access. Accordingly, I have tried to commit a good portion of my professional energy as an attorney and educator to those goals. I try to help find ways within systems to create more justice and equity. The NFL has LONG been a system on the “caveman” side of the evolutionary scale, showing consistently it does not value NFL players’ lives or health (#NFLLivesMatter?), that it does not value women (from Josh Brown to Ray Rice to Greg Hardy women are treated as fodder for a violent NFL), it condones and glorifies racism whether via Hank Williams, Jr. or the Washington Redskins and also perpetuates homophobia in various ways (Eli Apple most recently, but also Le’Veon Bell, Nick Kasa, etc).</p>
<p>In short, the NFL enables and permits a lot of evil shit. It has for a very long time. That means that I also enable and permit a lot of evil shit by my support of the NFL every single time I whittle a day away watching football. That means that every single fan who silently supports, and every single player who silently plays likewise allows that same evil feces. And despite my love of watching the NFL and the Seahawks, I find myself constantly torn between my being complicit in the traumatic brain injuries, homophobia, misogyny and racism which infects the NFL systematically and being entertained by the sport.</p>
<p>This is about personal accountability; it’s not just the NFL. It’s also us. Ugh.</p>
<p>So when this whole business about Colin Kaepernick being blackballed came about I thought, “Here’s a guy who is taking a stand and it is important to stand with him.” Period. A black man being blackballed for taking a political stance to save lives is 100 percent unacceptable. Make no mistake: Kaepernick is in fact being blackballed because of his political stance and people of conscience should take some action. #IStandWithKaepernick So let’s light up social media and shame those teams whose quarterbacks suck (thank you Richard Sherman) and refuse to give him a workout! Let’s be supportive of those teams (thank you Seahawks) who do give him a workout! And even though Kaepernick is an ex-49er, this goes deeper than simple team rivalries. Plus, the Seahawks been whupping that ass for some years now! So I am 100 percent down to use whatever meager influence I have because we cannot let any injustice, no matter how small, slide within racist and misogynistic systems.</p>
<p>I found it interesting though when folks began talking about making Kaepernick emblematic of all the wrong the NFL has done throughout the years. Folks began talking about Kaepernick like he was Muhammad Ali; like we collectively had a duty to ensure that he played this year otherwise something was horribly, horribly wrong with the NFL. Therefore, they began to talk the language of “boycott” to try to ensure that Kap got a shot this year.</p>
<p>And I thought, “Really? That’s where we draw the line? Kaepernick? This is the thing that shows something is horribly, horribly wrong with the NFL? Things have been horribly, horribly wrong with the NFL. His situation is just a individual symptom of a systemic disease. Kaepernick’s situation is happening because we’ve ALL―including Kaepernick―allowed all of the other stuff to fester for a very long time.”</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong — NFL owners have done Kaepernick an injustice. Moreover, that injustice is, unfortunately, completely consistent with history in regards to many black players who take brave social stances (Craig Hodges, Mahmoud Abdul Rauf, Curt Flood, Muhammad Ali, etc.). But this is where we draw the line? I get it ― we, the fans, should pressure our teams to give qualified backups a chance to ensure that Kap is able to take the field again. Personal accountability. But straight up, fans have consistently witnessed the NFL allowing worse things than this over and over and over and... and the truth is that most players, including Kaepernick, have let those injustices slide. Violence against women. Systemic racism. Homophobia. Those injustices are still going on in real time. So if we want to mass boycott, then it seems fair that it should be something that helps the masses. For that mass boycott to happen, the boycott should speak to that cross-section of foul isht that the NFL has been doing for years, the racism, the homophobia, the misogyny. For that mass boycott to happen, we have to go after the underlying disease, not just the symptom. If we’re going to go after all of that? Cool. Count me in! If not? I’m not convinced. If it only speaks to one person, Kaepernick or otherwise, I see two basic problems with a boycott:</p>
<p>1) Kaepernick has not Built an Intersectional Coalition for Justice by Speaking Out Against Violence Against Women, Systemic Racism or Homophobia Against NFL Players. Kaepernick’s protest, while absolutely powerful and necessary, is not intersectional. His protest is only centered on threats that he, a heterosexual, millionaire male athlete, squarely feels and shows no deference for other victims of the NFL. Although Kap’s protest is no doubt righteous and also no doubt his right under free speech protections, it does not speak to the many, many horrible things that the NFL has allowed for years. He has not spoken up for and amplified the Native activists who have decried the Washington Redskins team name and logo for decades. He has not spoken up against the NFL for allowing women to be brutally beaten by NFL players and then summarily forgotten into NFL and pop culture irrelevance. He has not spoken up when fellow NFL players or NFL prospects were asked, illegally, about their sexual orientation. In short, as legitimate as Kap’s protest is, I’m not sure we can reasonably expect others to find themselves in his struggle since he hasn’t chosen to find himself in theirs.</p>
<p>2) An Individual Remedy for Kaepernick Will Not Address Systemic Racism, Misogyny and Failure to Address Harm to NFL Players. Aside from the very real lack of intersectionality in the framing of Kaepernick’s protest, I simply do not know what bigger victory is won by Kaepernick getting his job back. In fact, a mass boycott and subsequent action from the NFL will almost ensure that all the other systemic evil the NFL perpetuates will still be in place and unchecked. Instead, the NFL will pat itself on the back and we’re left to believe that all is well. The systemic misogyny will still be in place and unchecked. The systemic racism will still be in place. The systemic homophobia will still be in place and unchecked. If all social justice champions—anti-racist, anti-homophobic, anti-misogyny, etc.—decided to join in a boycott and Kaepernick got his job back, it would be seen as a huge victory for justice. In the event of such a “victory” the owners and the NFL would certainly bask in the glow of being evolved and responsive to injustice allowing them to sideline the very real claims of less visible and more disenfranchised groups to whom NFL continues to do harm. In the end, Kaepernick gets his job back and the NFL continues to capitalize upon a system which remains almost entirely unaccountable and continues to perpetuate injustice.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I get it. Shout out to everyone who is pushing for Kaepernick to get a spot on an NFL roster and shout out to legendary Harry Belafonte and celebs like Spike Lee for pushing this conversation. I’m with you. It’s a necessary conversation. All NFL fans should always push the NFL to be more humane and justice-oriented just like all participants of any system should always push that system to be better. But asking fans to boycott has got to be bigger than that―if folks really want this mass boycott to go down it has to be about more than Kaepernick. His situation is just a symptom of all of the stuff that the NFL has gotten away with for decades. It has to be about a collective benefit; Kaepernick is the low hanging fruit. This has to be about the systemic violence that the NFL has committed for decades in regards to racism, homophobia and misogyny. There has to be some collective good; these are systemic harms, so an individual remedy is simply not enough. So let’s get it―let’s REALLY do something to create justice in the NFL. Let’s work to build coalition with the many oppressed groups directly harmed by the NFL. Let’s do that, absolutely. But it should be that. Otherwise, this will be nothing more than an individual pseudo-progressive windfall for an individual justice-minded NFL player.</p>

<p>An undefeated little league softball team in Virginia lost their bid for the world series not because of their playing but their conduct on social media.</p>
<p>Atlee Little League softball team was disqualified on Saturday after taking a Snapchat photo of themselves sticking up their middle fingers to their crushed competitors the day before, Richmond station WRIC reported.</p>
<p>The decision came just hours before the girls, ages 12-14, were set to perform in the Junior League World Series. The team that was targeted in their photo, Kirkland American Little League from Washington ― which Atlee defeated 1-0 on Friday ― took their place instead.</p>
<p>“It’s a travesty for these girls,” Atlee manager Scott Currie, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch on Saturday. “Yes, they screwed up, but I don’t think the punishment fit the crime.”</p>
<p>The photo, which shows six uniformed girls making the gesture in a dugout, has since been deleted. The offending girls’ head coach also instructed his players to apologize to Kirkland’s team in person.</p>
<p>It wasn’t enough for the Little League International Tournament Committee, however.</p>
<p>The team’s behavior was “inappropriate,” Little League spokesman Kevin Fountain said, adding that it violated the organization’s policies, “regarding unsportsmanlike conduct, inappropriate use of social media, and the high standard that Little League International holds for all its participants.”</p>
<p>Atlee head coach, Chris Mardigian, later speaking to RVA Sports Network, said that the girls posted the photo in response to several incidents of harassment that they had received from Kirkland members during the tournament.</p>
<p>During Friday’s game, a Kirkland baserunner was ejected for stealing signals from the Atlee team and giving them to their batter. A Kirkland coach was also ejected from the game, the Times-Dispatch reported.</p>
<p>Kirkland went on to lose Saturday’s title game to Poland, Ohio, 7-1, the Seattle Times reported. </p>
<p>Though most on social media appear to agree that the girls’ behavior was wrong, there are mixed responses to the committee’s decision.</p>

<p>Usain it isn’t so!</p>
<p>Usain Bolt, the fastest human being in the world, was outrun by two people on Saturday during his final 100-meter race at the IAAF World Championships in London. Saturday’s runs marked the 30-year-old Jamaican sprinter’s apparent retirement from individual races, and a devastating retirement it is.</p>
<p>American Justin Gatlin, who was twice banned from track and field after testing positive for drugs, finished first in the 100-meter race, crossing the finish line in 9.92 seconds and nabbing the gold. Christian Coleman, another American, took silver at 9.94 seconds.</p>
<p>Bolt had a slow start and paid for it in the end, finishing in 9.95 seconds and settling for bronze. His 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds, set in 2009, remains unbeaten.</p>
<p>“My start is killing me,” Bolt told ESPN after the race. “Normally it gets better during the rounds, but it didn’t come together.”</p>
<p>Gatlin reportedly had tears in his eyes after he won the race. He told the International Association of Athletics Federation that Bolt praised him after the win.</p>
<p>“Usain said to me, ‘Congratulations, you deserve it,’” Gatlin said. “He knows how hard I work.”</p>
<p>Bolt’s bronze medal on Saturday marks the first time the sprinting phenom has ever been beaten during a 100-meter at the world championships. During a 2011 race, he had a false start and was eliminated from competition.</p>
<p>With nine Olympic gold medals and 11 world championship gold medals, Bolt has established himself as a world legend ― one of the fastest men in recorded history. </p>
<p>Losing his chance to cement his career with one final gold in the 100-meter dash sours his iconic status only just a touch. Though Gatlin won the race, he still bowed down to Bolt after crossing the finish line.</p>
<p>Bolt’s official retirement begins after he races for Jamaica during the 4 x 100-meter relay race in London next Saturday. Though he may have upset a few fans this weekend, he has not lost their respect.</p>

Tures, ContributorProfessor of Political Science, LaGrange College">
<p>News came from the International Olympic Committee that the 2024 Olympic games would be awarded to Paris, not Los Angeles. In doing so, the IOC clearly showed its preference for the country that elected Emmanuel Macron to preside over the games, instead of the one that chose Donald Trump, despite a strong bid by L.A. and the city’s history in hosting successful games.</p>
<p>On paper, the City of Angels had the stronger bid than the City of Lights. Los Angeles had hosted two successful Olympic Games: 1932 and 1984. In fact, unlike so many recent financial failures, cost overruns, abandoned facilities and inadequate venues, the California city demonstrated that it is a perfect site for the 2024 Olympics.</p>
<p>“Los Angeles, however, is almost a model Olympic city,” wrote Travis Waldron on HuffPost. “It turned a small profit in 1984, and even Olympic skeptics have said that the city’s bid is financially sound and unlikely to lead to the kind of massive cost overruns that so many other hosts have experienced.”</p>
<p>Paris, meanwhile, has not hosted an Olympic Games since 1924. It had lost out on several earlier Olympic bids, and was beginning to look like a persistent “also-ran” or “frequent candidate” in the race to host the international games.</p>
<p>Yet Macron is the one flashing the thumbs up, while Trump, who tweeted about his work to land the 2024 Olympics, isn’t. And their politics may have a lot to do with that.</p>
<p>As Adam Taylor with The Washington Post noted, Macron touted his country’s values at the Olympic meeting in Lausanne, something Trump skipped. “We need multilateralism, the structures that provide agreement among nations…and tolerance, which the Olympic movement illustrates well,” the French President said. “Olympic values are our values.” If he’s reelected, he’ll play the host to the 2024 Olympic Games.</p>
<p>As Michael Bastasch with The Daily Caller added, “Macron is determined to bring the games to a country that embodies ‘openness, tolerance and respect for the environment,’” an open reference to his country’s support for the Paris Agreement, something President Trump openly rejected, claiming he was dedicated to protecting Pittsburgh, and not Paris.</p>
<p>Trump’s verbal attacks on Mexico and his decision to build the wall and put travel bans on several countries, is unpopular worldwide, and even in America as well. He has clashed with many world leaders, even backing Macron’s ultranationalistic rival. His “America First,” slogan might play well in Ocala, Florida, might not in the Olympic Committee, which likely cringed at the prospect of a Trump in his last year in office (if reelected) giving a long speech similar to the Boy Scout lecture in July.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti seemed to understand the importance of international cooperation in his city’s bid to host the Olympics. As Taylor with the Washington Post reported “Garcetti stressed that the city aims to make the games economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. The mayor vowed to protect Los Angeles taxpayers’ money and to use the event as a way to create long-lasting access to sports for children throughout the city.” And Garcetti noted his city’s support for the Paris Climate Agreement. As a result, L.A. was awarded the 2028 Olympics, much earlier than many such bids are usually given.</p>
<p>It seems as though the IOC really wanted the Olympics to return to Los Angeles as soon as possible, on the anniversary of the highly successful 2024 games. But they couldn’t swallow the specter of Trump calling for the crowd to boo domestic rivals, bragging about this big electoral win, and making inappropriate references or nationalistic appeals.</p>

<p>Manchester United and Barcelona faced off at FedEx Field in Landover Maryland last Wednesday in an International Champions Cup game watched by over eighty thousand fans. The starting lineups were impressive, with both teams fielding virtually all of their stars, even those who are reportedly heading to Paris on a world record transfer in the next week or so. </p>
<p>While the first actual attempt on goal was from United, as Romelu Lukaku just missed a cross from Marcus Rashford, Barcelona, with Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar, leading the line, spent the majority of the first half on the attack, keeping United’s Chris Smalling, Michael Carrick, and new boy Victor Lindelof busy. </p>
<p>The interplay between the the Barcelona forwards was a delight to watch...</p>
<p>...but they were unable to get the ball past David De Gea in the United goal, whenever they were able to make it past the United defenders...</p>
<p>...which wasn’t as frequently as they would have liked.</p>
<p>United only got the ball out of their half infrequently, typically on a counter attack, but they all came to nought...</p>
<p>...as Barcelona’s tempo was several steps higher than their English counterparts.</p>
<p>Barcelona proved time and time again that they were just too strong for their competition.</p>
<p>Even Paul Pogba couldn’t manage to turn on some magic and get the ball in the net, with Lukaku starved of the ball for most of the half.</p>
<p>So Barcelona continued their attacks... </p>
<p>...and finally in the 32nd minute it paid off, as Messi saw an opening, passing the ball through the gap...</p>
<p>...where Antonio Valencia missed a chance to clear, leaving Neymar free to spin and shoot the ball past De Gea to give Barcelona the lead.</p>
<p>After the restart, Barcelona continued to attack, a United side that seemed devoid of ideas, through their triumvirate...</p>
<p>... but the closest they came resulted in Pogba header away of their 12th shot on goal of the half (United somehow mustered 6, of which only 3 were on target).</p>
<p>Upon being given the list of Barcelona’s 10 substitutions and United’s 4, the announcer decided to forgo pronouncing any of the names and just read out the numbers of the players. Given that the only Barcelona player that remained was the goalkeeper, the game’s tempo slowed down to a crawl, giving United a chance to come back into it.</p>
<p>Although that didn’t mean that Barcelona didn’t still have their opportunities to extend their lead.</p>
<p>As the game drew to a close, Lukaku...</p>
<p>...Anthony Martial...</p>
<p>...Marouane Fellaini...</p>
<p>...and Marcus Rashford... </p>
<p>...did their best to try to find an equalizer...</p>
<p>...but there was no way through the 2nd string Barcelona defense..</p>
<p>...until, in injury time, Martial found himself free inside the penalty box... passing the ball to an onrushing Rashford...</p>
<p>...who sent the ball into the sky, leaving the game ending in a 1-0 win for Barcelona... </p>
<p>...and the man of the match award going to the only Barcelona player who made it through the entire game - Jasper Cillessen </p>

<p> Los Angeles has agreed to host the 2028 Summer Olympics, the International Olympic Committee announced Monday afternoon. Los Angeles, which last hosted the Olympics in 1984, had originally sought to hold the 2024 Games. When several cities backed out of potential Olympic bids, however, the IOC decided to break precedent and award the 2024 and 2028 Olympics at the same time. Los Angeles’ agreement to host the 2028 Summer Games means Paris, the only other city to bid, will host the competition in 2024. The news was originally broken by the Los Angeles Times, which cited a source close to the city’s negotiations with the IOC. </p>
<p>“This is an historic day for Los Angeles, for the United States and for the Olympic and Paralympic Movements around the world,” said Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti in a statement released by LA 2024, the private organizers behind the city’s Olympic bid. “Today, we take a major step toward bringing the Games back to our city for the first time in a generation and begin a new chapter in Los Angeles’ timeless Olympic story.”</p>
<p>The United States last hosted the Summer Olympics in 1996, in Atlanta, and the Winter Olympics in 2002, in Salt Lake City.</p>
<p>Los Angeles’ efforts to host the Olympics for a third time ― it also held the games in 1932 ― were nearly derailed at numerous points in the process. The U.S. Olympic Committee initially tapped Boston as its choice to bid for the 2024 Games, until that bid collapsed amid fervent local opposition in July 2015. Los Angeles stepped in to replace Boston a month later. But it was seen as a long shot to beat out Paris, which last hosted the Olympics in 1924 and had narrowly lost out to London for the right to host the 2012 Games.</p>
<p>Handing the 2024 and 2028 games to Paris and Los Angeles could bring some needed stability ― and good public relations ― to an Olympic movement that has been in peril in recent years. The exorbitant costs and empty, destructive legacies of the Olympics have turned off potential hosts, and in each of the last two bidding cycles, the IOC has found itself with only two cities willing to handle the games. Three cities canceled Olympic bids for the 2022 Winter Olympics, while four others backed out of 2024 contention thanks to opposition from local citizens and political leaders.</p>
<p>Los Angeles, however, is almost a model Olympic city. It turned a small profit in 1984, and even Olympic skeptics have said that the city’s bid is financially sound and unlikely to lead to the kind of massive cost overruns that so many other hosts have experienced.</p>
<p>Garcetti and LA 2024 have highlighted the city’s 1984 experience, pushing their bid as a chance to show that the Olympics can be held in a responsible manner.</p>
<p>In a press conference Monday evening, Garcetti stressed that the city aims to make the games economically, socially and environmentally sustainable. The mayor vowed to protect Los Angeles taxpayers’ money and to use the event as a way to create long-lasting access to sports for children throughout the city. </p>
<p>Still, the process this time around will likely create its own challenges. No city has ever before had to wait more than a decade between agreeing to host the games and actually staging them. That creates a long window during which political, social and economic forces could change dramatically, exacerbating the numerous problems that always arise in staging the event. </p>
<p>California’s state legislature and the Los Angeles City Council must still approve the plans to host the 2028 Games. The city council will consider the matter in August, according to the LA 2024 release. It is expected that both bodies will approve the agreement, given that both had already given their blessing to the 2024 effort.</p>
<p>That will pave the way for the IOC’s members to formally award the 2024 and 2028 Olympics to Paris and Los Angeles, respectively, at a September meeting in Peru.</p>
<p>Organizers behind NOlympics LA, a grassroots group that launched this year, said they would continue fighting to keep the games out of Los Angeles while lawmakers consider the 2028 agreement. </p>
<p>“We’re not surprised but we’re really disappointed,” said Jonny Coleman, who helped start the group. “By no means is this officially on. There’s so many things that have to happen before the games are actually awarded here. In the next month or so, we’re going to be really loud and really aggressive.”</p>
<p>The story has been updated with the announcements from the International Olympic Committee, LA 2024 and the mayor’s press conference. </p>

<p>The U.S. women’s national soccer team went from awful to awesome in a hurry on Sunday against Brazil.</p>
<p>The Americans entered the Tournament of Nations match in San Diego having lost to Australia for the first time after 27 straight victories over the Aussies ― and they trailed Brazil 3–1 with time running out, the Washington Post noted.</p>
<p>Then the Americans played like champs, scoring three goals in nine minutes to stun the Brazilians, 4-3.</p>
<p>Christen Press (80th minute), Megan Rapinoe (85th minute) and Julie Ertz (89th minute) did the honors. Here they are:</p>
<p>As of Monday the Americans were ranked No. 1 in the world as of June 23. They sure played like it for nine minutes on Sunday.</p>

<p>You might want to sit down for this one.</p>
<p>Colin Kaepernick, the former 49ers quarterback who sparked controversy last season by refusing to stand for the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality, may finally land a job.</p>
<p>Baltimore Ravens president Dick Cass said the club has had “direct discussions” with the free agent quarterback, and he “wants to play,” the Baltimore Sun reported Sunday.</p>
<p>Now it appears up to the franchise to arrive at a decision. “We’re trying to figure out what’s the right tact,” owner Steve Bisciotti told the Sun.</p>
<p>He added in jest, “So pray for us.”</p>
<p>Kaepernick has been unemployed since opting out of his 49ers’ contract in March.</p>
<p>Debate has ensued whether teams’ lack of interest stemmed from Kaepernick’s performance, or because he is perceived by some as a divisive figure who has reportedly hurt the league’s TV ratings (even though just 3 percent of viewers in a survey said his demonstrations affected their watching habits).</p>
<p>NFL commissioner Roger Goodell insisted the player wasn’t being blackballed, but his statistics on a bad 49ers team ― 2,241 passing yards, 16 touchdowns and four interceptions plus 468 yard rushing in 11 starts last season ― were decent.</p>
<p>Kaepernick, who has reportedly indicated he would stand for the anthem this season, visited the Seattle Seahawks in early June but wasn’t signed.</p>
<p>The Ravens’ starting quarterback, Joe Flacco, is currently out with a back injury.</p>

<p>Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt has made an odd discovery about his locker buddy.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, Watt tweeted his revelation that the Texans’ defensive end D.J. Reader does not, for some reason, believe that dinosaurs once really walked the earth.</p>
<p>“Our lockers have been next to each other for over a year and I just found out [Reader] doesn’t believe in dinosaurs. Says fossils are fake,” Watt wrote.</p>
<p>“Don’t knock my theories man,” Reader replied. At time of publication, the player’s Twitter timeline is filled with good-humored responses to others on the social media platform voicing their criticisms of his anti-science standpoint. (For the record, he does not believe Earth is flat.)</p>
<p>After Watt’s initial tweet began gaining steam, he added an apologetic message: “Ay man, I’m not the one who said it! I love you either way cuz you’re my boy. I just had to see if anybody had your back. (They don’t).”</p>
<p>An employee of the Houston Museum of Natural Science, which houses many different dinosaur skeletons in its Morian Hall of Paleontology, was also quick to reply with an offer to share his knowledge on the subject. </p>
<p>“Hey [Reader], I’d love to tour you around [HMNS] and show you otherwise #becausescience,” wrote Sahil Patel, who works as an outreach presenter. </p>
<p>Reader, who attended South Carolina’s Clemson University, responded to decline the offer, sharing his view that “science isn’t always a[n] absolute truth.”</p>
<p>At least everyone can agree on the rules of the game?</p>

<p>Katie Ledecky is on a roll. </p>
<p>The 20-year-old American swimmer made history on Tuesday, snagging her 12th gold medal at the swimming world championships, the most achieved by any woman ever.</p>
<p>Ledecky clinched the gold after annihilating the competition in the 1,500-meter freestyle ― an event she already holds the world record in ― at the World Aquatics Championships in Budapest. She bested runner-up, Spain’s Mireia Belmonte, by a staggering 19 seconds. </p>
<p>Ledecky’s time, 15:31.82, was the fourth fastest in the event’s history. Ledecky’s win also made her the first three-peat winner in the event, reported CNN.</p>
<p>Silver medalist Belmonte said she had gone into the race assuming she would not win it. </p>
<p>“Katie Ledecky is on another planet so the goal of the race was to win the silver medal. For me, it is gold,” Belmonte told AFP.</p>
<p>Images from the 1,500-meter race showed Ledecky far ahead of her rivals. When she won, the other competitors were so far behind, most weren’t even pictured on the screen.</p>
<p>The gold medal was Ledecky’s third at this year’s world championships. She also came in first in the 400-meter free and the 4x100-meter free relay. Her time in the 400-meter free was a championship record.</p>
<p>Ledecky’s medal tally is likely to grow before the conclusion of the championships. On Wednesday, she clinched the top semifinal time in the 200-meter freestyle. She is also slated to compete in the 800-meter free and the 800-meter free relay. </p>
<p>Winning six golds at the championships would be a record-tying achievement for Ledecky, a record currently held by fellow Team USA swimmer Missy Franklin, AP reported. Prior to Tuesday, Franklin also held the record for most gold medals won at the world championships. Recovery from shoulder surgery kept Franklin from competing at the world championships this year. </p>

<p>A young couple have decided to file a lawsuit in California against Golden State Warriors star Draymond Green after they were assaulted by Green and his associates last summer in East Lansing, Michigan.</p>
<p>During a press conference on Tuesday, former Michigan State football player Jermaine Edmondson and Bianca Williams, his girlfriend, talked at length on Tuesday about how their lives were altered for the worse after the NBA’s 2017 Defensive Player of the Year and his associates physically assaulted the both of them last year. </p>
<p>The couple claimed Green told Edmondson, “I know niggas like you. I pay for niggas like you scholarship,” before two of his associates choked Edmondson. Soon after, one of them allegedly turned around and choked Williams, too.</p>
<p>“I spent the whole night crying,” Williams said Tuesday. “I still feel that man’s hand around my neck.”</p>
<p>“You don’t know how it feels to see your girlfriend hurt and scared,” Edmondson added. “I felt powerless to help her.”</p>
<p>According to their account, things didn’t stop there. The next night, when Edmondson asked Green to apologize, Green punched him in the face, they said. </p>
<p>Green faced assault charges last summer as a result of the incident, later accepting a plea deal and agreeing to pay a $500 fine. But the victims struggled to return to their normal lives after the incident.</p>
<p>Edmondson even temporarily left Michigan State University as he dealt with harassment on and offline.</p>
<p>“No one stood up to me, even close friends who I thought would be in my wedding one day,” he said, adding, “I have never felt so low in my life. I felt like I was being kicked when I was already on the ground.”</p>
<p>The couple will be represented by high-profile attorney Lisa Bloom, who organized the press conference at her Los Angeles offices. Bloom has represented a number of celebrity clients including Kathy Griffin and Blac Chyna, and said she feels Green never properly accepted responsibility for his role in the events that transpired in Michigan.</p>
<p>Williams agreed. “We do not want this to happen to anybody else,” she said. </p>
<p>The NBA star is just one month removed from helping his team win the NBA Championship against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Last season, he earned his second straight All-Star selection and a spot on the league’s All-NBA Third Team.</p>

<p>After serving over eight years in prison for his role in a 2007 armed robbery inside a Las Vegas hotel, O.J. Simpson will go before the Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners on Thursday to plead his case as to why he should be released as early as October.</p>
<p>The hearing will be streamed live on various sites, according to the board, and we’ll make sure to keep one running on this page.</p>
<p>The hearing begins at 1 p.m. ET at the board’s office in Carson City, Nevada. Simpson will dial in via video conference from Nevada’s Lovelock Correctional Center, where he is imprisoned. </p>
<p>Simpson, 70, will speak to the same four board members who granted him parole on some of his charges in 2013. They will consider factors including “Simpson’s age, whether his conviction was for a violent crime, his prior criminal record and his plans after release” when deciding whether to grant him further parole, the board has said.</p>
<p>Legal experts widely expected Simpson to be informed that he will be released from prison on Thursday, including now-retired district attorney David Roger, who served as prosecutor in the Simpson case.</p>
<p>In 2008, Simpson received a nine-to-33-year prison sentence for charges including armed robbery and kidnapping as a result of a group effort to steal memorabilia from two men inside the Palace Station Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Four of the other men involved in the crime only ever received probation, and a fifth was released from prison in 2011. Many have described Simpson’s near-decade-long imprisonment as unspoken retribution for his acquittal in the murder of his estranged wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman in 1994. </p>

<p>Chris Christie wants to enjoy his summer. America won’t let him. </p>
<p>The New Jersey governor and devoted fan of the New York Mets was watching the Mets play the St. Louis Cardinals on Tuesday night when he caught a foul ball from the third row at Citi Field.</p>
<p>The catch ― a barehanded left-hand catch he made while seated ― was impressive. But instead of cheers, the crowd reacted to the Republican’s luck with moans and loud boos, according to reports.</p>
<p>No one seemed to notice or care that he gave the ball to a child sitting a couple of rows behind him. Even the game announcers seemed peeved about Christie’s catch. </p>
<p>“Nice to see him get from the beach to the ballpark,” Cardinals broadcaster Dan McLaughlin quipped on the telecast.</p>
<p>Christie is one of the least popular governors in New Jersey history, with polls showing that he has a 15 percent approval rating.</p>
<p>It didn’t help that the governor was recently photographed relaxing on an empty beach in New Jersey that he had ordered closed to the public amid a state government shutdown during the Fourth of July weekend. The beach included a governor’s residence in Island Beach State Park.</p>
<p>When asked by reporters July 1 about his beach getaway, Christie replied, “Run for governor, and you can have a residence there,” according to NJ Advance Media.</p>
<p>In an interview with MSNBC on the same day as the Mets vs. Cardinals game, the governor said of his unsavory reputation, “I do care how I’m perceived, but I’m not going to sacrifice my family for public perception,” adding, “I had to make a choice between political optics and my family. When I have to make a choice between the two, I have never made anything clearer to the people of New Jersey — I’m picking my family.”</p>
<p>Let’s just hope that Christie is making some good memories this summer, because a lot of people won’t let him forget the bad ones.</p>

<p>“It took forever and wasn’t always fun to watch…” begins the recap of Saturday’s Yankee-Red Sox game by Mike Axisa of the Yankee fan website, RiverAveBlues. The game he is referring to was Saturday’s 16-inning, nearly six-hour uber-marathon, which along the way featured a scintillating five minute umpire review.</p>
<p>Baseball is a pastoral sport in a digital age. There’s actually great appeal in that. But even Springsteen stops the show after three hours. Nobody wants to watch anything for six hours. Not even porn.</p>
<p>As a Yankee fan, I adore catcher Gary Sanchez, but in the course of a game he visits the mound more than the dugout. Meanwhile, the batter scratches his thigh and plans his stepping-out-of-the-box strategy. Want to improve “pace of game”? Simply ban pitcher-catcher conferences except at the top of an inning or a pitching change. There’s not a fan in the country who would complain. If pitchers and catchers insist that is not workable, then provide them with ear pieces so they could talk to each other during the game. Broadcast their conversation live. Hey, it’s the 21st century. Privacy is dead, even in baseball.</p>
<p>Oh, and about those full infield conferences. We all know there’s no crying in baseball. Well, there are no huddles either.</p>
<p>But nooooo, Commissioner Rob Manfred’s genius move to shorten the game was to eliminate pitches thrown for intentional walks. Never mind that many games don’t have intentional walks. Look on the positive side: Going forward, any game with ten intentional walks will now be two minutes shorter. Sweet relief!</p>
<p>As any baseball fan knows, it’s not just the length of the games destroying the sport, it’s the start and end times. The seventh game of last year’s World Series started on a Wednesday night, a few minutes after 8, and ended at 12:30. Even without the extra inning of play and 17-minute rain delay, the game would have ended around midnight. (In case you’re wondering, the average length of a 2017 postseason game was nearly three and a half hours.) Conversely, this year’s Super Bowl was played on a Sunday, started at 6:37 and, even with the extended halftime and overtime, was over by 10:30. Night baseball games should start no later than 7.</p>
<p>And enough with these mind-numbing extra inning borefests. During the regular season, baseball is 9-innings period. After that, decide the game with a home-run derby. Already, I hear the traditionalists howling. Let them howl. Fans love the home-run derby. In fact, the recent all-star home-run derby was more highly rated on television than the all-star game itself. Give the people what they want, which is shorter games with more drama.</p>
<p>While I’m on the subject:</p>
<p>No more playing Kate Smith’s revolting rendition of “God Bless America” during the 7th inning stretch at Yankee Stadium, not unless they are going to follow it with Woody Guthrie’s “This Land Is Your Land.” But no, that would add more time to the game. Ban Kate Smith. She was probably on steroids anyway.</p>
<p>And speaking of cutting time between innings, relief pitchers should be prohibited from throwing warm-up pitches on the field. That’s what the bullpen is for. Also, there is no reason for a manager to stroll out to the mound to make a pitching change. Make the change from the dugout, get the new guy in there.</p>
<p>And commercials: cut one thirty-second spot between innings and, viola, you have just cut at least eight minutes per game.</p>
<p>Baseball is the only team sport without a clock, something I used to love. But now I want a pitch clock. Throw the freakin’ ball! To the batter. Not the first baseman! How many pick-off attempts does a man have to watch before you can call him a fan? </p>
<p>As for umpire reviews: The guys in the booth have 90 seconds. If they can’t figure it out by then, the ruling on the field was close enough.</p>
<p>I can’t take much more of this. If none of the above works, then drastic times call for drastic measures. Two strikes and you’re out? Three fouls after two strikes and you’re out? Seven inning games? None of this could be ruled out because the six-hour, extra-inning death march can no longer be tolerated. As Captain Picard once said, “The line must be drawn here.”</p>
<p>My next move would be to designate fans as fielders. Then, any ball, fair or foul, caught by a fan would be an out. This would not only have the advantage of shortening games, but would encourage exciting competition between fans. For example, Yankee fans at Fenway Park would want to make sure that a homer hit by Aaron Judge was not caught by a Red Sox fan and ruled an out. What a great idea!</p>

<p>LONDON, July 16 (Reuters) - Behind Roger Federer’s artistry and charm lies a ruthless streak of razor-edged steel which surfaced again on Sunday as he thrashed suffering Marin Cilic 6-3 6-1 6-4 to secure a record eighth men’s Wimbledon singles title.</p>
<p>The incomparable Swiss turned his 11th Wimbledon final into a procession as tearful seventh seed Cilic, battling his nerves and a bloody blister, suffered a torrid afternoon.</p>
<p>Federer described Cilic’s predicament as “cruel” after ending his torment with an ace after one hour 41 minutes ― but there was no hint of sympathy as, 23 days before his 36th birthday, he became the oldest Wimbledon men’s singles champion.</p>
<p>That attitude from the third seed, who last triumphed at the All England Club five years ago, was not surprising since Federer’s dream of title number eight had been shattered by Novak Djokovic in the 2014 and 2015 finals.</p>
<p>His take on Cilic’s injury spoke volumes for the killer instinct that has earned him a record-extending 19 majors and taken him past American Pete Sampras’s record of seven men’s singles titles at Wimbledon in the modern era.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t tell what it was,” Federer said. “But if I saw him limping around, or if I saw him pull up hurt, I would start to think, maybe I’ll throw in a dropshot to really check him out, then one more, because that’s what you do.</p>
<p>“You need to hurt him where it hurts already.”</p>
<p>It was not really necessary as Federer enjoyed one of his easiest title victories.</p>
<p>Having reached the final without dropping a set, he was braced for Cilic’s power tools but, apart from the first four games, resistance from the Croat was about as daunting as a man brandishing a stick of celery.</p>
<p>In winning the tournament without the loss of a set, Federer matched the 1976 feat of Swede Bjorn Borg and his own run 10 years ago at the Australian Open.</p>
<p>LATEST MILESTONE</p>
<p>His latest milestone continued a remarkable resurgence for Federer, who took six months off last year before returning to win the Australian Open ― ending a five-year wait for an 18th grand slam many thought would remain elusive.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to take more time off, I don’t know!” said Federer, whose family has doubled with the addition of twins Leo and Lennart to go with twin girls Myla Rose and Charlene Riva since his 2012 title ― all of whom were watching on Sunday.</p>
<p>“It is very special. Wimbledon was always my favorite tournament, will always be my favorite tournament. My heroes walked the grounds here.”</p>
<p>For Cilic, who beat Federer in the U.S. Open semi-finals before going on to claim his sole major in 2014, his first final at the citadel of tennis, was a living nightmare.</p>
<p>In pain from a blister, his legs appearing tied together and his mind in turmoil, Cilic seemed on the verge of quitting as the tears flowed and the crowd murmured in embarrassment.</p>
<p>“I got a really bad blister,” Cilic said, explaining his mid-match meltdown that had fans nonplussed. “It didn’t hurt so much that it was putting me in tears. It was just that feeling that I wasn’t able to give the best.”</p>
<p>SHAKY START</p>
<p>Nerves were apparent for both men as Cilic opened the 131st men’s final with a shaky service game.</p>
<p>Federer, who lost serve only four times in the fortnight, saved a break point at 1-2 and in the next game.</p>
<p>At 2-2 Cilic took a tumble to the turf trying to reach a Federer dropshot and followed that with two lame backhands to hand master front-runner Federer control.</p>
<p>Scenting blood, Federer polished off the first set before breaking Cilic to lead 3-0 in the second.</p>
<p>Cilic slumped to his chair, sobbing, as the physio and doctor stood by and for a moment it looked as though the final might end in a retirement for the first time since 1911.</p>
<p>Cheered on by the crowd, Cilic returned to the fray but any sense of a real match had vanished as Federer raced through the rest of the second set.</p>
<p>After treatment on his stinging feet, Cilic at least showed some spirit to detain Federer for 40 minutes in the third set.</p>
<p>But the outcome was never in doubt as the Swiss, eyes narrowing for another batch of records, broke in the seventh game before wrapping up the match with his eighth ace.</p>

<p>LONDON (Reuters) - An inspired Garbine Muguruza stormed to her first Wimbledon title on Saturday, blowing away in-form American Venus Williams 7-5 6-0 with arguably the performance of her career after tight and tense early exchanges.</p>
<p>In the first women’s final played under the Centre Court roof, a high-quality first set gradually built toward a captivating conclusion after both players began with two comfortable service holds.</p>
<p>Muguruza saved two set points in the 10th game, the first a 19-stroke rally that ended when Williams netted a forehand. The Spaniard broke in the following game when another lung-bursting rally ended on a forehand error from the American.</p>
<p>An astonishing defensive lob in the next then took Muguruza to two set points, the second of which she converted.</p>
<p>That three-game sequence seemed to break the resolve of the American who, trying to become the oldest woman to win Wimbledon for 109 years, lost the second set to love in an equally astonishing turnaround.</p>
<p>The Venezuela-born 23-year-old sealed her second grand slam victory after a successful Hawkeye challenge of a Williams forehand that sailed just beyond the baseline.</p>

<p>The U.S. Women’s Open Championship kicked off on Friday at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey ― a choice that many consider somewhat ironic given President Donald Trump’s history of disparaging women.</p>
<p>“The [U.S. Golf Association] and [the Ladies’ Professional Golf Association] could have made a clear and unequivocal statement against sexual assault by moving this tournament,” Shaunna Thomas, co-founder of women’s rights group UltraViolet, said Friday in a statement. </p>
<p>“Instead they chose to embrace the man who is a walking, talking example of a sexual predator. Shame on the USGA. Shame on the LPGA. This is a stain on your brand that will not wash away. Let’s be clear, by choosing to hold this tournament at Trump’s course, the USGA and the LGPA are endorsing Trump’s behavior.”</p>
<p>Some of the tournament’s participants decided not to wade into politics.</p>
<p>Lizette Salas, a professional golfer and second-generation American from a Mexican immigrant family, said that a lot of thought went into deciding whether she should play on a course owned by a man who has disparaged Mexicans so many times.</p>
<p>“My job is to be a golfer,” she said. “I think my way of inspiring more females is to play regardless of what’s happening. I think I would make a bigger impact if I played this event, because it’s my national championship as well. I deserve to be here.”</p>
<p>Trump returns Friday from a two-day trip to Paris for Bastille Day and heads straight to Bedminster.</p>
<p>A handful of Democratic senators had penned a letter to USGA CEO Mike Davis asking the organization to reconsider its choice of location for the Women’s Open. “In declining future association with a brand that degrades women, the USGA and LPGA have an opportunity to make clear to the world, and most especially young Americans, that our nation will not tolerate nor do business with any company that condones or excuses action that constitutes sexual assault,” they wrote in October 2016.</p>
<p>“We’re a golf organization,” said Davis at a press conference in May, responding to growing public pressure to change the venue. “We’re simply not going to cross that line into politics. We can appreciate that some people do, but we’re a golf association, and we’re sticking to golf.”</p>
<p>“The USGA respects the rights of all individuals [to] express their views,” Janeen Driscoll, director of public relations for USGA, told HuffPost in a statement. “Our focus remains on conducting the ultimate test of golf for the best female players in the world and providing an enjoyable and safe experience for all at the U.S. Women’s Open Championship.” </p>

<p>Tim Tebow is looking more and more like a real baseball player.</p>
<p>The former Heisman Trophy winner and NFL quarterback cracked a walk-off home run Thursday to lead St. Lucie over Daytona, 5-4, and complete a doubleheader sweep.</p>
<p>Promoted from the Mets’ Low-A minor league team in Columbia to High-A Port St. Lucie last month despite a paltry batting average, Tebow is now on an 11-game hitting streak.</p>
<p>ESPN’s major league comparison, however, might be pushing it just a tad:</p>
<p>Tebow’s prospects do appear brighter than when the Mets signed him to a minor league contract in September, even though he hadn’t played organized baseball since high school. He’s hitting .327 since being moved up a notch in the team’s farm system.</p>

<p>(Reuters) - Chuck Blazer, the former FIFA executive committee member who pleaded guilty to racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering, has died, his lawyers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A statement from Blazer’s two lawyers did not provide details or the circumstances of his death. The New York Times said he had died of rectal cancer, which he had suffered for years.</p>
<p>Blazer, 72, was general secretary of the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) from 1990 to 2011.</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty in the United States to bribery and financial offenses in 2013 and was later banned by FIFA from all football activities for life. </p>
<p>According to the transcript of his November 2013 guilty plea, Blazer and others in FIFA agreed to accept bribes in the bidding process for the 1998 World Cup in France and the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.</p>
<p>FIFA’s ethics committee said Blazer breached rules on loyalty, confidentiality, duty of disclosure, conflicts of interest, offering and accepting gifts, and bribery and corruption.</p>
<p>As part of the 2013 plea agreement, Blazer agreed to cooperate with investigating authorities in the United States while they investigated the FIFA corruption scandal, which eventually played a crucial role in the departure of its former president, Sepp Blatter.</p>
<p>Blazer had accused another former CONCACAF president, Jack Warner, of having pocketed funds from a $10 million project to support the African diaspora in Caribbean countries at the time of South Africa’s successful bid to stage the 2010 World Cup. </p>
<p>FIFA opened an ethics investigation over bribes-for-votes allegations in the 2011 FIFA presidential election after Blazer reported a possible case of bribery between Blatter and then FIFA presidential candidate Mohamed Bin Hammam. </p>
<p>Warner and Bin Hammam were also banned by FIFA for life.</p>
<p>INFORMANT</p>
<p>FIFA was not immediately available for a comment on Blazer’s death. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn, which is overseeing the FIFA probe, did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Blazer was born on April 26, 1945 in New York, according to the New York Times. He worked as a salesman and coached his son’s soccer games in New Rochelle, New York, in the late 1970s before beginning his rise in international soccer.</p>
<p>Blazer kept a blog detailing his travels and his meetings with dignitaries, celebrities and politicians, including a visit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2010.</p>
<p>“At one moment, he looked at me with a very serious gaze and said, without cracking a smile, “You know, you look like Karl Marx!” Blazer wrote.</p>
<p>In one blog post, the white-bearded Blazer posted a photo of himself dressed in a red Santa Claus suit smiling as he peered over a pair of eye glasses. In another, Blazer posted a video of Max, his blue and gold parrot, dancing as he stood on the front of a scooter in Central Park near a group of jazz musicians.</p>
<p>“Go max, go. It’s ok,” a man’s voice, purportedly Blazer’s, is heard on the video.</p>
<p>Blazer was on a motorized scooter along Fifth Avenue in New York in November of 2011 when federal agents approached him, the New York Daily News reported.</p>
<p>“We can take you away in handcuffs now, or you can cooperate,” the agents told him, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>He cooperated. His then-domestic partner, Mary Lynn Blanks, told Reuters in a 2016 article that she accompanied Blazer to soccer-related events while he was acting as an informant for U.S. investigators, sometimes wearing a bugging device.</p>

Tures, ContributorProfessor of Political Science, LaGrange College">
<p>The death of America’s All-Star Game has been protected, even promoted by nay-sayers who say the times have passed it by. Yet the fundamental nature of the game is one that’s as enduring as the American spirit itself, which is why we’ll continue to celebrate it long after its critics depart from the scene.</p>
<p>“Dad, look! It’s a poster for Ender Inciarte!” My nine-year-old bounds over to a sign, cleverly designed to look like one of the many Karen Handel-Jon Ossoff yard signs that dotted the North Atlanta landscape. The sign begs fans to cast their ballots for the Atlanta Braves centerfielder, a little known player who has become a fan favorite for his stellar play, robbing opponents of hits (he currently leads the league in put outs), and he led the league in assists last year, gunning down baserunners (leading the league in double-plays from the outfield). In fact, he won a Gold Glove Award from Rawlings for his efforts.</p>
<p>Inciarte doesn’t just prevent hits; he smacks plenty of his own. Quietly, he became a league leader this year in base hits, often hit in timely situations, sometimes the result of his hustle in beating out the infielder’s throw. And he’s number one in at-bats, never missing an inning of work if he can help it (and is in the top 10 in making it on base, and scoring runs). All this hard play is done at a fraction of what baseball stars make (he makes little more than $500,000, a pittance compared to the rest of the game’s best). He inspires my son to try and beat out infield hits of his own, or try to throw out a speedy runner after stopping a hard hit ball. If only we had tickets for the Ender Inciarte bobblehead doll night!</p>
<p>In a way, Inciarte is a lot like a Horatio Alger story. From Marivel Venezuela, he made his way to America, even as his home country spirals into chaos thanks to the authoritarian rule of Nicolas Maduro. Given his public criticism of the Maduro regime, Inciarte is probably as much a political refugee as anyone today. Baseball players there targets, not sources of admiration.</p>
<p>As my son poses for a picture with the “Elect Ender Inciarte” sign, he points at the others touting the All-Star candidacies of Brandon Phillips, an African-American second baseman, and the team’s star, Freddie Freeman, a white first baseman willing to move to third base to help the Braves win. It’s a multicultural team that the fans embrace as they battle teams with more stars and bigger payrolls in the competitive National League East.</p>
<p>In fact, the greatest moment in our team’s recent years was the huge fan effort to write-in Freeman against Yasiel Puig of the Dodgers. Pundits had hoped to see the talented but controversial Puig win, instead of the lunch-pail style Freeman, who quietly has become one of the game’s best, while others like Mike Trout, Bryce Harper and Puig win the headlines. Last year, Freeman stopped to shake my hand at a Braves Day event while the staff was trying to drag him off to a press conference that he was late for.</p>
<p>Times have changed. No longer do we punch out a ballot. It’s online nowadays. I’m sure it will give the purists something else to gripe about. These mandarins of the game have told us that we’ve ruined the game with inter-league play, by making the All-Star Game determine home field advantage. Those who chase fads, on the other hand, claim that the game has been eclipsed by football, basketball, hockey, or even the X-games. Yet which Pro Bowl or NBA All-Star game is filled with moments like Pete Rose crashing into Catcher Ray Fosse, or Carl Hubbell striking out a “who’s who” list of Hall-of-Famers, Reggie Jackson’s towering homer, Dave Parker gunning down Jim Rice and Brian Downing, Chipper Jones getting a hit at his last All-Star game or the moving tribute to Mariano Rivera?</p>
<p>“Dad! Ender Inciarte’s going to the All-Star Game!” Zach exclaimed the good news a week or so ago as he bounded over to me, having read the trailer on the TV in Mighty Joe’s Pizza. And yeah, we’ll let him stay up to send the end. This game is special tonight.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the games change, or society changes, there’s one thing about the Major League Baseball All-Star Game that remains the same and taps in to what America is all about. It combines individual talent and teamwork. In the game itself, players from a variety of teams must come together to harness their skill, while checking their egos to get outs and score runs. And yes, a little-known player can take his place among the best, and possibly be immortalized as the game’s MVP.</p>

<p>Do not come for Simone Biles. </p>
<p>The Olympian posted a relaxed Instagram of herself on a beach Saturday and apparently someone decided to deride her. A user posted a comment, which has since been deleted, about how much time off Biles seems to have been taking for herself. Biles posted a screenshot of the insult and posted it to her Twitter account.</p>
<p>Remember, the internet keeps receipts. </p>
<p>“Seems like you have partied non stop for a year,” the user commented. ”#Trash #unfollow #suckyassrolemodel.” </p>
<p>The 20-year-old Olympian was not about to let that stand.</p>
<p>“Talk to me when you train for 14 years and earn 5 Olympic medals,” Biles said. “I think kids would say otherwise. My year off is well deserved. Take a couple seats.” </p>
<p>In case anyone needed a reminder, Biles began training as a gymnast in 2003 at six-years-old. She took home four gold medals and one bronze in the 2016 Rio Olympics. Let’s not even begin to mention the number of world championship medals she’s accumulated over the years. She’s not even legally allowed to drink in the United States but she’s received international attention for her accomplishments. </p>
<p>So yeah, needless to say Biles is probably the last college-aged American who deserves the title of lazy. </p>
<p>Her fans were thrilled that she didn’t allow the nasty remark to slide. </p>
<p>Guess you could say Biles’ reply really “stuck.” </p>

<p>Florida police released new video on Friday proving that tennis star Venus Williams legally entered an intersection moments before she was involved in a deadly car crash near her neighborhood in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.</p>
<p>Authorities initially alleged that Williams was “at fault” in the fatal crash that occurred on the afternoon of June 9. A police report released in late June claimed the athlete was traveling around 5 miles per hour when she failed to yield the right of way to another driver when entering an intersection, and was subsequently hit.</p>
<p>Witnesses told police that the other driver, 68-year-old Linda Barson, entered the intersection on a green light when she hit Williams’ vehicle, according to the earlier police report. </p>
<p>The Palm Beach Gardens Police Department said on Friday that the new video evidence shows that Williams “lawfully entered the intersection on a circular green traffic signal,” according to a statement released with the video and obtained by HuffPost.</p>
<p>Police said in the new statement that Williams was traveling north through the intersection when a Nissan Altima cut her off and made a left turn in front of Williams’ vehicle. The Altima caused Williams to “stop advancing through the intersection to avoid a collision,” the statement read. Once the Altima passed Williams, she continued lawfully through the intersection.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Barson’s light had just turned green and Barson’s vehicle entered the intersection, where it collided with Williams’ vehicle. Jerome Barson, Barson’s 78-year-old husband and a passenger in the car, suffered a head injury during the accident and died two weeks after the crash. </p>
<p>The Barson family has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Williams, who was not injured in the accident, claiming that Jerome Barson’s death was caused “as a result of the negligence of Williams,” the Palm Beach Post reported last week. </p>
<p>Michael Steinger, the Barson family’s attorney, said in a statement to The Associated Press that Friday’s video still shows that Williams caused the accident and violated “the Barsons’ right of way.”</p>
<p>“There is nothing that disputes Ms. Williams was in the intersection on a red light, and the witnesses clearly confirm the Barsons had a green light and lawfully entered the intersection,” Steinger said.</p>
<p>Police said on Friday that the crash is still under investigation and that officers are still working to identify the driver of the Altima, according to the Palm Beach Post.</p>
<p>Williams, who is currently in London at the Wimbledon Lawn Tennis Championships, has not been cited or charged for her role in the crash.</p>
<p>During a news conference following her first-round win on Monday, she broke down in tears when a reporter asked her about the car crash.</p>
<p>“There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and ― yeah. I’m completely speechless,” Williams said to the crowd of reporters, before stepping away from the conference in tears. She later returned, saying she would only answer questions about tennis.</p>

<p>Jon Stewart returned to television on Friday night ― not to crack jokes about President Donald Trump, but for a cause he’s been championing for some time: supporting America’s military service members and veterans.</p>
<p>The former host of “The Daily Show” joined ESPN anchor Hannah Storm to co-host SportsCenter’s coverage of the Warrior Games live from Chicago’s United Center. The multisport event, put on by the Department of Defense, features more than 260 wounded, ill and injured active-duty and veteran service members. </p>
<p>“These are athletes that refuse to define themselves by the worst thing that ever happened to them, but define themselves by how they reacted to it,” Stewart said on air. “And that’s what’s so impressive about them.”</p>
<p>Stewart was instrumental in bringing the Warrior Games to a televised audience. He and his son attended last year’s event, held at the United States Military Academy.</p>
<p>“It was an incredible experience,” Stewart said. “On the drive home, I just kept saying, ‘The cameras should be here, these are people that this country needs to see right now, ESPN should be all over that.’ And my son said, ‘So why don’t you call them?’ So I did.” </p>
<p>Among those who joined Storm and Stewart during Friday’s broadcast was U.S. Navy veteran Petty Officer 1st Class Ryan Shannon. According to the Morris Herald-News, Shannon has complex regional pain syndrome resulting from a leg injury, and is considering amputation.</p>
<p>“For me, Warrior Games was something I wasn’t supposed to be able to do. I wasn’t supposed to be able to run again,” he told ESPN. “You start falling into that little dark hole. Warrior Games brings you out of that hole. It gives you something to fight for.” </p>
<p>On air Friday, Stewart said it’s also important to remember the sacrifices of military service member’s families.</p>
<p>“I think, oftentimes, we forget the burden of the military falls on a very small percentage of Americans,” he said. “So the veteran and the veteran’s family really bear that burden, oftentimes alone. And when you first come back from the war, it can be really isolating. And if you come back with an injury, visible or otherwise, even more so.” </p>
<p>“For every athlete you see here, there are a thousand people standing behind them, still struggling to overcome it,” Stewart added. “This is a chance for the nation to show our attention and our appreciation for all they’ve been through.” </p>

<p>ESPN recently released its annual “Body Issue” which includes interviews and nude photographs of sixteen athletes and sports teams. Bare backsides and strategically placed hands and sports equipment to “cover” critical body parts have filled the glossy pages of ESPN annually since the magazine first instituted this issue in 2009.</p>
<p>Each year the interviews in this issue are filled with athletes relating their success stories, sharing struggles they have overcome, and commenting on how “empowered” they feel about their nude photographs.</p>
<p>Many people are no longer surprised when they see ESPN’s Body Issue since nude or sexualized images in magazines are so common. Unlike the yearly Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue which “overtly sexualizes women, something that cannot be denied though the publication attempts to envelope its raw sexual appeal in the veneer of ‘empowerment’ and ‘athleticism,’” ESPN’s Body Issue is most likely not intended to be sexually arousing.</p>
<p>But let’s take a step back and question why these images are so popularized in the first place, and work to think critically about the images we consume and promote.</p>
<p>ESPN is well aware that sex sells.</p>
<p>While the intention of the individual interviews might be to relate the athletes’ accomplishments, the nude photoshoots serve to obscure the athletic talent with visual sexual appeal. The athletes’ accomplishments could easily be highlighted, and their impressive physique could still be showcased, with clothing.</p>
<p>In addition, ESPN is aware that a significant portion of its consumers are young men. One photoshoot includes six female hockey players who huddle together in a photograph similar to a Victoria’s Secret advertisement minus the lingerie. Many who click on the Body Issue are not interested in further understanding the athletes’ physical skills; they are more interested in seeing them naked.</p>
<p>Whether ESPN intends it or not, the Body Issue is one more drop in the bucket of increasingly normalizing sexual objectification (of both men and women—but overwhelmingly women) in our society.</p>
<p>Some evidence for this fact is the double standard response to male/female nudity in the latest Body Issue. When it was revealed that the front cover of the Body Issue contained a photo of a naked football player, men took to Twitter complaining about the male nudity prompting Buzzfeed to publish an article in response.</p>
<p>The female nudity was met with silence or brief comments like “Where’s her butt?”</p>
<p>If mass distributed nude pictures were truly empowering, wouldn’t male nudity be met with more acclaim? Or is the argument that stripping before cameras is empowering an illusion?</p>
<p>Our culture views nude images as a source of empowerment when in actuality they are more often a conduit for sexual objectification. In a way, this likens to the Wizard in the Wizard of Oz who is upheld as a giver of power and autonomy but is actually a puppet, enveloped by smoke, operated by an embodiment of the mundane.</p>
<p>The ESPN Body Issue is asking us to “pay no attention to the man behind the curtain,” to the reality of objectification, and instead to buy into the impressive myth of nudity-based empowerment.</p>
<p>So while the ESPN Body Issue may not be the most flagrant offender of sexual objectification, it is important to see through the smoke and to think critically about the cultural fallacies it portrays.</p>

The Hawks Have A Few Ideas" date="2017-07-07" authors="Houston Barber, ContributorSports and culture writer in Atlanta, GA">
<p>For the past two years, the city of Atlanta has acted as an experimental lab for unconventional moves by major professional sports franchises. The Braves uprooted from their beloved home in downtown to a smaller, ritzier ballpark in the suburbs. The Falcons are a month away from opening their behemoth new stadium in the heart of the city, complete with the NFL’s cheapest concessions and an ambitious plan to the be the most energy efficient football stadium in America. </p>
<p>Now the Atlanta Hawks are here to add their contribution to the ever changing nature of Atlanta sports, with further details on the overhaul of their home over the next two years. </p>
<p>Philips Arena, the current home of the Hawks, has all the simple necessities an NBA team could ask for: great location, plenty of luxury suites, and a playoff contending team. But these days, simple necessities don’t cut it. The Hawks ranked 26th out of 30 in team attendance last year, and with a roster on the verge of a rebuild, something needed to be done. </p>
<p>So how do you get a city to care about its NBA team? If you’re the Hawks, it’s all about unashamedly embracing everything that makes your city unique. And not many cities are more unique than Atlanta. So when the Hawks put together a press conference last week to announce what their new arena will look like, there was one announcement that stood out. Killer Mike’s SWAG Shop, a fully operational barber shop and social destination inside the arena with a full view of the court, run by the Atlanta music icon himself. </p>
<p>Also revealed were plans for a food joint operated by country music star Zac Brown, and a partnership with Top Golf to create one-of-a-kind luxury suites that carry its next-gen simulator. And if that wasn’t enough, the Hawks will also introduce the NBA’s first courtside bar and club located directly behind one of the baskets. </p>
<p>The fan reaction to these announced changes was immediate, with many people saying different versions of the same thing: “This is the most Atlanta thing ever.” And for the Hawks, there couldn’t be a higher compliment.</p>
<p>The city of Atlanta is in the midst of a cultural renaissance that has seen it become the setting of some of the most talked about tv shows and movies, and a home for many of the country’s most talented artists. The goal for the Atlanta Hawks is just to connect the first part of their name with the last and become inseparable from the city they play. It’s a full-fledged strategy that goes beyond just the can’t-miss amenities. </p>
<p>When current Hawks CEO Steve Koonin took over the role in 2014, he noticed a problem with his arena. A huge section of the stadium was blocked off from the average fan and only accessible to club members and those in luxury suites. For Koonin, this set up wasn’t representative of the city he knew. So, the Philips Arena renovations will include a complete gutting of the current concourse in favor of a more open walkway with 360-degree connectivity. The Hawks say the inspiration for this was the ultra-popular Atlanta Beltine, an outdoor walking trail through the city that has been key to revitalizing sections of downtown. </p>
<p>Of course, it’s impossible to know how the new amenities in Philips Arena will change fans’ attitude towards the team, but it certainly has people talking. And in the Lavar Ball era of the NBA, that’s never a bad thing. </p>
<p>“Every element of the arena under the roof will be brand new and designed with Atlanta and its vibrant communities in mind,” says Koonin. With the success of everything else set in Atlanta recently, there’s once again reason to be excited about basketball in the city. </p>

<p>It’s the Twitter equivalent of a quarterback sneak.</p>
<p>Ever since Wednesday, the Carolina Panthers’ social media department has been posting a series of tweets that ranged from innocuous to slightly bizarre.</p>
<p>Finally, on Friday, the team gave a hint there was a deeper meaning to it all.</p>
<p>The team tweeted out the opening lines of the theme song to “The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air,” Will Smith’s beloved early 1990s sitcom, by making it the first word of every tweet.</p>
<p>Oh, and they did it in reverse order to make it more challenging.</p>
<p>Considering the team went 6-10 last season, this may be the most well-played thing the Panthers have done in a while.</p>
<p>Here are the tweets in the order in which they would appear should you choose to sing along.</p>
<p>Of course, if you prefer the original without all the tweets...</p>
<p>This seems to be part of a trend. Earlier this week, a man named Richard Cook did a cryptic tribute to Smash Mouth, by tweeting out the first verse of “All Star” by making it the first word in every tweet.</p>

<p>Mattek-Sands, 32, was competing against Sorana Cirstea when she slipped on the court and screamed out in pain.</p>
<p>“Help me, help me, please!” she cried out after collapsing to the ground.</p>
<p>Cirstea told BBC News that she had never seen such an injury.</p>
<p>“It was like something you see only in the movies,” Cirstea said. “I tried to comfort her but I panicked. I felt useless. All she kept saying was, ‘Sorana, help me, help me.’”</p>
<p>The extent of Mattek-Sands’ injury is not yet known.</p>
<p>Mattek-Sands was tied with Cirsea, at one set apiece, as the match headed into the third set at the All England Club. They had been playing the set for 13 minutes when the injury happened.</p>
<p>Mattek-Sands was forced to retire from the game and was taken to a hospital after more than 20 minutes of on-court treatment by medical staff. Her husband, Justin, was also on the court comforting her.</p>

<p>Venus Williams stepped out of a Wimbledon news conference in tears Monday after she was asked about a fatal car crash that involved her earlier this month.</p>
<p>The star appeared following her first-round victory against Belgium’s Elise Martens.</p>
<p>“There are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and ― yeah. I’m completely speechless,” Williams said. Williams was overwhelmed with emotion and stepped out of the press conference, returning later to say she would only answer questions pertaining to tennis. </p>
<p>Days before the tournament, police in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, found Williams “at fault” for failing to yield the right of way to another driver in an intersection. Police say Williams’ SUV was traveling through the intersection at around 5 mph when she collided with the other vehicle. </p>
<p>Lisa Barson, 68, told police she had a green light and Williams cut in front of her. The driver’s 78-year-old husband, Jerome Barson, was in the passenger seat and sustained a head injury. He died two weeks later. </p>
<p>Before the tournament started, Williams addressed the crash on her Facebook page.</p>
<p>Williams has won Wimbledon five times. She’s considered one of the favorites to win this year.</p>

<p>In a rare ruling, a well-known cyclist has been disqualified from the Tour de France after he was seen elbowing another rider, sending his competitor crashing into a barricade.</p>
<p>Peter Sagan, 27, of Slovakia, was kicked out of the competition on Tuesday after he was accused of willfully causing the crash that injured British cyclist Mark Cavendish and caused two others to fall during the sprint finish in Vittel in the race’s fourth stage, officials said.</p>
<p>“I get on with Peter well,” Cavendish, who rides with team Dimension Data, later told Reuters. “If he came across, it’s one thing, but the elbow. ... I’m not a fan of him putting his elbow in me like that. A crash is a crash. I’d just like to know about the elbow, really. I’d just like to speak to him about it.”</p>
<p>The 32-year-old, who was taken to a hospital for evaluation, said he suffered a gashed finger, which he guessed would need stitches, as well as an injured arm that was later seen placed in a sling. The injuries to his arm may have been amplified by a previous injury, he told the BBC.</p>
<p>Sagan, cycling with the Bora–Hansgrohe team, went on to place second, behind Frenchman Arnaud Demare, in Tuesday’s fourth stage of the race. For the last five years, he won the green sprinter’s jersey awarded at the multi-week tournament, and was vying to tie the record by claiming a sixth. The tour, which began on Saturday and finishes on July 23, is made up of 21 stages over about 2,200 miles and the cyclist with the lowest overall time wins a yellow jersey.</p>
<p>Sagan, who also has won two UCI Road World Championships, apologized to Cavendish after the crash but also defended what happened. He told The Associated Press: “I just didn’t know that Mark is behind me, he’s coming from the right side.</p>
<p>“Mark was coming pretty fast from the back and after I just didn’t have time to react, to go left, and he just came (into) me and after into the fence,” he said.</p>
<p>His explanation and apology weren’t enough for race officials, however.</p>
<p>Race jury president Philippe Marien cited a part of the International Cycling Union rules for Sagan’s disqualification. The rule says that any rider making a willful obstruction “against one of the 1st 10 riders placed” faces elimination.</p>
<p>Aside from doping offenses, disqualifications are rare in the race that was first held in 1903, according to the AP.</p>
<p>In 2010, Australian Mark Renshaw got the boot for trying to headbutt fellow rider Julian Dean in a sprint finish.</p>

<p>Jimmy Choi proved himself to be a true gladiator out on the “American Ninja Warrior” course.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old tech consultant from Bolingbrook, Illinois, defied his Parkinson’s disease to take on the notoriously tough run at the Kansas City qualifiers in footage that aired Monday.</p>
<p>He made quick work of both the floating steps and the tricky hang glider, before ultimately coming unstuck on the broken pipes obstacle.</p>
<p>“That right there ought to inspire everyone,” said the show’s host, Akbar Gbajabiamila, who later tweeted this message of support:</p>
<p>In an emotional preview video that was broadcast before his run, Choi revealed how he was diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson’s when he was 27.</p>
<p>After several years of struggling to cope with his condition, he discovered that exercise helped him to manage it ― and he’s since run 13 marathons, cycled several 100-mile rides and competed in multiple triathlons.</p>
<p>In the process, he’s raised more than $100,000 for actor Michael J. Fox’s foundation, which funds research into the disease. He represented the organization on the show.</p>
<p>“My goal is to go out there and show everybody out there, no matter what they’re faced with, the hardest step is that first step,” said Choi, whose daughter inspired him to apply for the program. “Once you take that first step, the rest of it comes easy.”</p>
<p>His performance appeared to go down well with Twitter users:</p>
<p>Choi said he hopes to return to tackle the course again in 2018:</p>

<p>BMX rider Jack Dumper refuses to let his disability define him.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old from Bristol, in southwest England, was born without the lower part of his left arm. But that doesn’t stop him from performing daring stunts on his beloved bike, as seen in the video above.</p>
<p>He simply ties his left sweatshirt sleeve to the left handlebar for stability and pulls off tricks just like his peers. “I’ve always tried to keep a positive attitude towards it,” the teen told HuffPost. “It’s never held me back, so I’ve just embraced it.”</p>
<p>Dumper began riding BMX about 3½ years ago after “loving the look of the sport” but never taking part.</p>
<p>“I just jumped straight in and threw myself at every obstacle,” he said, revealing that pulling moves felt more “natural” after figuring out the sleeve trick.</p>
<p>After performing well at his first competition at a local skatepark, he secured a spot on the CrucialBMX team and is now set to compete at the international NASS action sports festival in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, on July 7.</p>
<p>Dumper ultimately dreams of becoming a pro-BMXer, although he says he “can’t decide this” and so will continue to “try my hardest to always improve my riding and ultimately have fun and see where it takes me.”</p>
<p>“Anything is possible, and you don’t need two arms to ride a BMX. BMX is for everyone,” he added.</p>
<p>And for other people with disabilities who may be daunted about taking up a sport, Dumper had this inspiring message:</p>
<p>“Don’t let anything stop you or anyone tell you that you can’t do it, because you can do anything that you set your mind to. You just need to find a way of doing it that works for you, as the only thing in your way is yourself.”</p>

<p>Listen, if you weren’t already jealous of the golden-boy, prepare yourself. </p>
<p>Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors have come to a $201 million, five-year agreement according to ESPN. </p>
<p>The 29-year-old is the team’s star player, but his previous contracts were paltry compared to some of his high-profile competition. Curry previously had a four-year contract with the team for $44 million, making this over four times the amount he was making when he brought the team to two national championships. When LeBron James signed to the Cleveland Cavaliers last year, he was offered $100 million for three years.</p>
<p>Even the King was celebrating the insane deal.</p>
<p>The National Basketball Association has the highest salaries compared to any other sport across the world. Curry’s deal is a part of a new collective-bargaining tactic called the “supermax” contract. Supermax agreements are meant to incentivize a team’s star player to stay on once offers come in from other teams, but the player has to meet certain requirements.</p>
<p>According to The Washington Post, a team has to meet a designated-player exception to be able to sign a supermax deal. That means the player has to win a most-valuable-player or defensive player of the year the previous season. Or if not the previous year, he has to have won the title two of the last three years. </p>
<p>Or, arguably the most important, he has to be on the team that drafted him or traded for him in his rookie year. This is a deal meant to inspire loyalty, after all.</p>
<p>Not only has Curry won the MVP-award for helping lead the team to win over the superstar-packed Cavaliers, but he’s been with the Warriors for eight years. The Warriors drafted Curry seventh in the first round of the 2009 draft.</p>
<p>ESPN reports that Curry will be the first NBA player averaging $40 million a year, without counting for inflation.</p>
<p>Damn. Good thing Curry has two adorable little girls to spend that money on. </p>
<p>What does one do with an almost 400 percent raise? </p>
<p>CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that the Warriors drafted Curry in the seventh round in 2009. In fact, he was drafted seventh in the first round.</p>

<p>Real Madrid soccer star and proud pop Cristiano Ronaldo may be up to his ears in more diapers soon.</p>
<p>Even as the Portuguese star cuddles his newborn twins, Mateo and Eva, born to an unidentified surrogate mother, reports have surfaced that he’s looking forward to the arrival of his next baby, with model girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez. Portuguese media outlets and Hollywood Life are reporting that the rumors are true, which may confirm what began with photos that appeared to show his girlfriend’s growing baby bump.</p>
<p>“I can confirm that Cristiano Ronaldo has been blessed with twins and his current girlfriend is pregnant with his child,” said a representative of the player, according to a Hollywood Life article Thursday.</p>
<p>The couple’s baby is reportedly due in October. (The soccer sensation also has a 7-year-old son, Cristiano Ronaldo Jr.)</p>
<p>While his twins were coming into the world, Ronaldo was playing for Portugal in the Confederations Cup in Russia, where his national team lost to Chile in an upset Wednesday.</p>
<p>Though disappointed at the loss, Ronaldo had something big to look forward to. He posed with his twins on his Facebook page Thursday. The BBC reported that the pair’s surrogate mom lives in the U.S. The twins were reportedly born June 8.</p>
<p>“I was in the service of the national team, as always, body and soul, even though my two children were born,” he wrote. “I’m very happy to finally be with my children for the first time.” He called the newborns the “two new loves of my life” in an Instagram post.</p>
<p>As for the speculation about a newborn on the way, some fans suspected as much in March when Ronaldo posed with Rodriguez, 22, and they both seemed to be cradling a bit of a baby bump. She has been photographed recently with what appeared to be a growing bump.</p>
<p>Ronaldo’s mother, Dolores Santos, last month dismissed the rumors as “nonsense” in an interview with Portuguese magazine Flash. The family had been secretive about the surrogate’s pregnancy.</p>
<p>Neither Ronaldo nor Rodriguez could immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Either way, it’s clear that big brother’s going to have lots of babysitting jobs to look forward to.</p>
<p>Not everything is rosy baby cheeks, though, for Ronaldo. Earlier this month, Spanish prosecutors accused the celebrated soccer star of setting up a shell company in the British Virgin Islands in order to evade paying $16.5 million in taxes. He made $93 million over the last 12 months to retain his standing as the world’s highest-paid athlete, according to Forbes. Ronaldo has denied any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Got something to say to NBA star Jimmy Butler? Then phone him. </p>
<p>The Minnesota Timberwolves’ newest recruit decided to give out his cell number at his introductory press conference on Thursday.</p>
<p>“My phone’s in my back pocket right now,” said the former Chicago Bulls player, while fielding questions about his possible impact on his new teammates.</p>
<p>“If whoever has anything to say to me feel free, (773) 899 6071,” the forward/guard told the TV cameras. “So, if you want an interview there you have it, please do.”</p>
<p>Social media users initially speculated that he’d given out a fake number.</p>
<p>But as Bleacher Report staff writer Joon Lee soon discovered, the digits that 27-year-old Butler doled out did in fact appear to be the real deal:</p>
<p>Butler later posted this clip to Instagram of himself talking on FaceTime with a fan:</p>
<p>As HuffPost found out, the number now directs to a Verizon message saying it has been “changed, disconnected or is no longer in service.”</p>
<p>But that hasn’t stopped dozens of Butler’s fan tweeting him screen shots of what they’ve been trying to message him:</p>
<p>He may not hear the pings over the sound of his boombox fish tank, however.</p>

<p>Friday marked the 45th anniversary of Title IX, a federal law stating “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” </p>
<p>Coinciding with Olympic Day, a global celebration of the birth of the modern Olympic Games and sport, the application of Title IX to athletics has gained significant public visibility and consistently inspires dialogue and action for change. </p>
<p>As the milestone for Title IX garnered much deserved attention, a few reports on the state of diversity and inclusion in various sectors of sport were released commemorating the occasion.</p>
<p>Two recently released reports that stand out are the NCAA’s report on the status of female student-athletes, coaches and administrators in the NCAA,“45 Years of Title IX: The Status of Women in Intercollegiate Athletics,” and “Gender, Race & LGBT Inclusion of Head Coaches of Women’s Teams: A Report on Select NCAA Division I Conferences for the 45th Anniversary of Title IX,” a report resulting from a partnership between LGBT SportSafe, The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) at the University of Central Florida, and the Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport at the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Commissioned by the NCAA Committee on Women’s Athletics, the Minority Opportunities and Interests Committee, and the Gender Equity Task Force, “45 Years of Title IX: The Status of Women in Intercollegiate Athletics” is the second report of its kind. Authored by the NCAA’s director of inclusion, Amy Wilson, the findings shared expand on those presented in the first edition five years ago.</p>
<p>“The NCAA’s office of inclusion welcomed the directive from the membership committees that focus specifically on diversity, equity and inclusion to provide this report to our colleges and universities on Title IX’s 45th anniversary,” Wilson said in a released statement announcing the report last week.</p>
<p>One of the key findings in the NCAA report is the low representation of minority women in NCAA leadership positions has remained mostly stagnant over the past five years. In that time span, the percentage of minority female head coaches of women’s teams has remained at just under 14 percent. </p>
<p>Just 2.5 percent of NCAA athletics directors are minority women.</p>
<p>“While the NCAA does not enforce Title IX, it does provide educational resources and programming to support schools’ efforts to comply with the law,” said Wilson, “We hope the report helps our membership with future planning when it comes to making key administrative, operative and programming decisions.” </p>
<p>In spite of significant progress made over the decades since the birth of Title IX, Bernard Franklin, NCAA executive vice president of education and community engagement, agrees there is much more to be desired and work to be done, specifically in collegiate athletics.</p>
<p>Encouraged by seeing some “progress” with respect to the federal law, Franklin said “the data also shows that there is still much to be done to increase equity and diversity, and to create a more balanced scenario in intercollegiate athletics for our student-athletes and administrators.”</p>
<p>“The report provides our membership and others who have influence with an up-to-date summary on where we can place our resources and support,” said Franklin, who also serves as the NCAA’s chief inclusion officer.</p>
<p>“I encourage all college presidents, athletics directors and conference commissioners to read this report and determine where their actions and voice can be best utilized in the support and progression for female administrators and our student-athletes both now and in the future,” Franklin said.</p>
<p>In an espnW column, Dr. Richard Lapchick, chair of the DeVos Sport Business Management Graduate Program at the University of Central Florida, made a “call to action to advance the issue of equality in hiring practices in college sports.” </p>
<p>Declaring he “wanted to help write this report because I recognize that our conference commissioners are powerful influencers on college sports,” Lapchick offered suggestions for action. </p>
<p>“Seeing these terrible results will, I hope, move the commissioners of these eight and the other Division I conferences to take action,” Lapchick wrote.</p>
<p>"This is the latest and the most thorough report on this matter of racial and gender inclusion,” said Reverend Jesse Jackson, Sr., president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition. “We must accept Richard's recommendations for healing.”</p>
<p>Serving as a comprehensive resource for issues related to gender and race in amateur, collegiate and professional sports, Lapchick directs UCF's TIDES and is president of the National Consortium for Academics and Sport (NCAS).</p>
<p>“When we consider that the percentage of coaches of color in women's sport remains below 20 percent, with women of color probably representing only a fraction of that percentage, we must wonder about the impact on our female student athletes of color," said Delise O'Meally, executive director of NCAS.</p>
<p>An Ernst & Young and espnW survey released last year found that among businesswomen occupying C-suite level positions, a notable 94% played sports with 52% having played sports on the collegiate level. While Title IX tends to permeate every suburban girl’s life, girls and young women in less-privileged areas of urban and rural America have been missed.</p>
<p>"Something needs to be done," said Ralf Heuser, a former vice president of the Field Hockey Federation and former director of the US Field Hockey Foundation. A passionate advocate for all things field hockey, Heuser is a tireless promoter of growing the Olympic sport that is played primarily by females in America. </p>
<p>“Only women play NCAA college field hockey with 88.7% of those student-athletes being white,” said Heuser who wants to change the startling statistic immediately, noting there is not a comprehensive resource center that details gender and race issues in field hockey.</p>
<p>Acknowledging under-supported programs and the plight of people of color that bring diversity to the sport — specifically naming Imani Ferguson and Dana Farrior in New Jersey; former Trinity College standout, Christine Mwaturura; Jazmine Smith and Eyekonz Field Hockey and Lacrosse in Philadelphia; Mimi Smith of Reach Field Hockey; former Temple University standout, Crys Baldwin; and former University of Maryland player, Courtney Deena — Heuser believes there are systemic challenges that have stifled the growth of the sport that need to be changed.</p>
<p>“In the USOC Quadrennial Congressional Report 2009-2012, as part of the Ted Stevens Sports Act, USA Field Hockey reported on its FUNdamental Field Hockey and You Go Girl program initiatives to increase ethnic and racial minorities participation,” Heuser explained. </p>
<p>“In the recently release USOC Quadrennial Congressional Report 2013-2016, USA Field Hockey did not report anything on either of the new initiatives, the results of previous efforts or progress in general," said Heuser, who has introduced field hockey through after-school programming at local elementary schools in Ventura County, California.</p>
<p>Referring to a Huffington Post article published last year on USA Field Hockey, Heuser said the governing body stated it was “preparing to introduce the sport to 20,000 under-served and low income children.” </p>
<p>To date "no outcome of this effort was ever reported," Heuser said. </p>
<p>From physical education programs in schools to community-based and competitive youth sports teams to world-class elite athletes, Title IX has impacted millions of girls and women. The personal accounts and reports offer insight to the state of the law and the landmark legislation’s present-day challenges.</p>
<p>“We must remember the key to growth is understanding that inclusion is value added -- not the cost of doing business," said Reverend Jackson.</p>

<p>Diana Taurasi became the leading scorer in WNBA history on Sunday.</p>
<p>Her Phoenix Mercury team fell to the host Los Angeles Sparks 90–59, but the blowout defeat became a mere side note to the history made by the former UConn star.</p>
<p>Taurasi scored on a layup with 45 seconds left in the first half to surpass Tina Thompson’s record of 7,488 points, ESPN reported.</p>
<p>Officials stopped the game and the crowd, including Taurasi’s parents and former Lakers star Kobe Bryant, applauded her feat, The Associated Press noted.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty special I got to do it in front of my family on Father’s Day in LA,” she said, per ESPN.</p>
<p>Taurasi notched 19 points for the game to push her new mark to 7,494 ... and counting. She has required less than 13 full seasons to amass her total, the sports network noted; Thompson tallied 7,488 over 17 seasons.</p>
<p>It’s been a big spring for the three-time Olympic gold medalist and two-time WNBA champion. In May she married former Mercury teammate Penny Taylor, who is now the club’s director of player development.</p>

<p>Brydan Klein may want to rethink calling anyone “stupid” during a tennis match, including himself.</p>
<p>After hitting a service return into the net Thursday in a lower-level pro tennis tournament in Nottingham, England, Klein grumbled to himself that he was a “stupid, stupid person.”</p>
<p>An official, Mo Lahyani, then assessed an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Klein and called the match, ruling it a 6-3, 6-4 victory for Sam Groth, according to Mens Tennis Forum.</p>
<p>As the video above shows, Klein pleaded his case that he was yelling at himself, but the official didn’t budge.</p>
<p>However, a bit of context is necessary. Klein had previously gotten into a beef with a lineswoman over a call and was assessed a penalty, Deadspin reported. So perhaps Lahyani assumed the “stupid” was directed at either him or another official.</p>
<p>In any case, it seems Klein was on the brink of defeat, but that’s probably not making him feel any better.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, Klein also lost in doubles, according to the tournament website. Meanwhile, Groth won his next singles match.</p>

<p>Thousands of people at the U.S. Open golf tournament in Wisconsin were shocked when a commercial blimp flying over the golf course crashed and burst into flames Thursday. </p>
<p>The pilot, who was still inside the airship when it crashed, suffered serious burns. He was taken to a Milwaukee hospital in serious condition, but his injuries were not considered life-threatening.</p>
<p>The blimp was advertising PenFed Credit Union above the Erin Hills golf course, about 35 miles north of Milwaukee, during the U.S. Open. It was operated by aerial advertising firm AirSign.</p>
<p>Here’s what we know.</p>
<p>The pilot had previously been involved in two forced landings.</p>
<p>Trevor Thompson, the pilot of the downed blimp, had been involved in two forced landings in the past three years. In 2016, Thompson was forced to make an emergency landing in Philadelphia after the engine failed mid-flight. Thompson also made a forced landing in 2015 when his airship was caught in high winds during a flight over traffic in Long Island, New York, headed to the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.</p>
<p>Thompson was trying to land because the winds were too strong.</p>
<p>Air Safety Investigator Pamela Sullivan said in a news conference Thursday that Thompson had reached an altitude of 1,000 feet when he noticed that the winds were too strong. Thompson said that he heard panels rip from the blimp during his descent, then his airship pitched nose down. The envelope of the airship collapsed and caught fire from the burners, which still burned residual fuel after the pilot shut them off.</p>
<p>Patrick Walsh, president of AirSign, believes the crash was caused by a failure of the airship’s skin, which likely caused the blimp to depressurize, The Guardian reported. </p>
<p>Thompson was wearing a fireproof flight suit.</p>
<p>Walsh told Milwaukee news station WTMJ-TV that Thompson was an experienced and careful pilot who was wearing a fireproof flight suit at the time of the crash. The crash left Thompson with burns on 40 percent of his body.</p>
<p>The blimp was actually a blimp-shaped hot air balloon.</p>
<p>Thursday’s crash involved a hot air balloon known as a thermal airship, according to Jon Radowski, owner of hot air balloon manufacturer Apex Balloons. Unlike a traditional blimp, which is inflated with helium, a thermal airship uses propane burners to fill the balloon with hot air.</p>
<p>Another difference between blimps and thermal airships: Blimps are always inflated with helium from the day they launch to the day they’re permanently grounded. An airship can be deflated and transported in a truck or trailer as needed.</p>
<p>Pilots of commercial thermal airships usually ride alone.</p>
<p>Thompson was alone in the airship when it crashed near the U.S. Open golf tournament, although airships like the one he piloted Thursday can hold up to three passengers. </p>
<p>Thermal airships “typically carry only the pilot,” Alvaron Bellon, a trustee of the Lighter-Than-Air Society, an organization for blimp and airship pilots, told HuffPost in an email. “In the case of the traditional helium-filled blimps, the pilot would be accompanied by a television operator.”</p>
<p>Blimp and airship pilots typically don’t wear parachutes.</p>
<p>Despite earlier reports, Thompson did not deploy a parachute prior to the crash. The pilot stayed in the airship as it crashed to the ground, according to Wired.</p>
<p>Since blimp and airship crashes are rare, pilots usually don’t wear parachutes or carry them aboard. Airships also travel relatively close to ground, just above 1,000 feet, which Radowski said is “too low for parachutes.”</p>
<p>“If [blimps] were to develop a leak (from a tear, or possibly even a gunshot) the loss of helium or hot air would be very slow as they are inflated at practically zero pressure,” Bellon said. “This allows ample time to land the airship.” </p>
<p>There are an estimated 20 to 25 blimps in the world.</p>
<p>Although there is no official tally on airships, the Van Wagner Airship Group estimates that there are 20 to 25 blimps in the world and at least 13 active advertising blimps.</p>
<p>Bellon told HuffPost that there are “quite a few thermal airships in use around the world” but said there was no accurate estimate of how many are being used today.</p>
<p>A ground crew follows airships when they are flying.</p>
<p>A crew in a vehicle on the ground typically follows airships during flights to assist with flight operations, takeoffs and landings. Goodyear blimp flights require 20 to 25 people, including the pilot, to complete a successful flight, Michael Dougherty, Goodyear’s chief pilot, told HuffPost.</p>
<p>It is unclear how many crew members were assisting AirSign’s craft on ground, but a member of that team reportedly pulled the pilot from the wreckage, according to Wired.</p>
<p>Blimp pilots must have a commercial pilot’s license. </p>
<p>Pilots who have commercial licenses start training to be blimp pilots by working with ground crews and eventually work their way up to being airship pilots. Some companies require blimp pilots to complete a substantial amount of flight time before they are allowed to operate their airships. Goodyear, for example, requires its pilots to complete 170 to 225 hours of flight time.</p>
<p>“Blimp pilot training is essentially on the job,” Bellon said. Candidates “will start working as a ground crew member and then get in-house, on-the-job training. The training culminates with a blimp certification from the FAA.”</p>
<p>Blimp pilots are more rare than astronauts. </p>
<p>There is no official count of how many airship pilots exist in the U.S., but Dougherty and Radowski agreed that there are definitely more astronauts than there are commercial blimp or airship pilots.</p>
<p>In case you were wondering, there are 50 active astronauts and 35 management astronauts, according to NASA.</p>
<p>The last major blimp incident occurred in 2011, when a Goodyear blimp crashed in Germany, killing the pilot.</p>
<p>A blimp that had Goodyear branding caught fire and crashed in Germany in 2011. The pilot instructed passengers to jump out of the airship when it was close to ground. Without the weight of the passengers, the blimp lifted into the air and continued burning with the pilot still inside. The pilot was the only fatality.</p>
<p>The most infamous crash was the Hindenburg disaster of 1937.</p>
<p>A German airship known as the Hindenburg caught fire and crashed while attempting to land at an airfield at Lakehurst, New Jersey. The accident killed 35 of the 97 passengers and crew on board.</p>

<p>A pilot was seriously injured when a blimp crashed while flying over the U.S. Open golf tournament in Erin, Wisconsin, on Thursday.</p>
<p>The aircraft deflated before bursting into flames. </p>
<p>“They were trying to give it some throttle and it didn’t go up,” witness Bryan Rosine told the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel. “Then there was a bunch of kabooms and smoke clouds.”</p>
<p>The pilot, whose name has not been released, suffered “serious burns” and was airlifted to a hospital, according to the Washington County Sheriff’s Office. He was the only person aboard the blimp, Patrick Walsh, CEO of AirSign, told CBS News. AirSign is the advertising agency operating the blimp.</p>
<p>The sheriff’s office also said that an initial investigation found the blimp “may have experienced mechanical problems.”</p>
<p>The crash happened about half a mile from the Erin Hills golf course, where the tournament takes place, according to the United States Golf Association. </p>
<p>Numerous videos posted on social media showed the aircraft seemingly floating to the ground.</p>
<p>Photos from the scene also showed first responders moving the pilot on a stretcher.</p>
<p>The blimp bore an ad for PenFed Credit Union. Prior to the crash, ad agency and blimp operator AirSign retweeted a tweet calling the blimp “ominously low.”</p>
<p>Dan Coffey, owner of the airfield where the blimp took off, told the Journal Sentinel that airships like this one are *approved by the Federal Aviation Administration* and that accidents are “extremely rare.”</p>

<p>OAKLAND, Calif., June 12 (Reuters) - The Golden State Warriors secured their second NBA championship in three seasons with a 129-120 Game Five win over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday, capping a near-perfect run through the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Warriors, who beat Cleveland in the 2015 Finals only to lose to them last year after squandering a 3-1 series lead, went a record-setting 16-1 in the playoffs, their only loss coming in Game Four of the best-of-seven championship.</p>
<p>The win provided redemption for the Warriors, who brought Kevin Durant over from the Oklahoma City Thunder last offseason to bolster their already high-powered offense.</p>
<p>Durant, who lost in his only previous Finals appearance in 2012, led the way for the Warriors with 39 points and was relieved after feeling pressure to deliver prior to the game.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t sleep for two days,” Durant, who was named the Finals MVP, said during an on-court interview. “I was anxious, I was jittery.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to lay it all out there. I put in work, I just had to trust in it. We were really good tonight.”</p>
<p>Cavaliers’ forward LeBron James had a game-high 41 points and guard Kyrie Irving hit tough shots all night but defensive breakdowns by Cleveland led to easy baskets late in the game for the Warriors, igniting a deafening crowd.</p>
<p>James said he had no reason to feel sorry for himself.</p>
<p>“I left everything on the floor every game, all five games,” he said. “I have no reason to put my head down.”</p>
<p>Warriors point guard Stephen Curry said the experience of losing last year’s Finals served them well this season.</p>
<p>“We learned from everything we’ve been through,” Curry said during the trophy celebration.</p>
<p>“To be back here and bring gold Larry (O’Brien trophy) back home, I’m just excited to be a part of this group and accomplish something special. I’m ready to do it again.”</p>
<p>An unprecedented third straight Finals clash between the Warriors and Cavaliers was hyped as the ultimate championship rubber match and expected to be the antidote for a postseason that had little in the way of drama.</p>
<p>But that idea fizzled fast when the Warriors opened with a pair of lopsided wins at home, fought back late to steal the next game in Cleveland and then, after dropping their first game of the postseason, closed out the series at home.</p>
<p>In the end, the Cavaliers simply did not have enough top-class talent to topple the Warriors, even with four-time league MVP James doing all he could to keep his team in it.</p>
<p>For James, already a three-times champion, the loss puts him in rare company as only the fourth player to come up short in five NBA Finals.</p>
<p>Cleveland’s inability to give the Warriors much of a fight has already sparked talk that James, who left the team in 2010 for Miami before returning four years later, could consider another move during 2018 free agency.</p>

<p>Patric Hornqvist’s late goal followed by an empty-netter from Carl Hagelin lifted the Pittsburgh Penguins to a thrilling 2-0 Stanley Cup-clinching victory over the Nashville Predators on Sunday.</p>
<p>With the victory, the Penguins clinched the best-of-seven championship 4-2 to win the franchise’s fifth Stanley Cup. They also became the NHL’s first repeat champion since Detroit did it 19 years ago.</p>
<p>Penguins captain Sidney Crosby, who was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs, said his team had worked hard to keep improving with each game.</p>
<p>“All playoffs long we got better as each series went on,” he added. “We tried to do that this series and I thought we did a good job of that.”</p>
<p>Hornqvist scored the game-winning goal with only 95 seconds left when he batted a puck that had bounced off the end boards out of mid air, off the net and off goaltender Pekka Rinne’s back and into the goal.</p>
<p>Hagelin iced the game with 14 seconds left when, with Rinne out of the goal in favor of an extra attacker, he scored into the empty net.</p>
<p>Penguins goaltender Matt Murray made 27 saves for his second straight shutout but caught a huge break early in the second period when the referee lost sight of the puck and mistakenly blew his whistle to stop play moments before Predators forward Colton Sissons poked home a rebound.</p>
<p>The referee thought Murray had the puck but it had actually trickled just behind him and into the crease where Sissons had what should have been the opening goal.</p>
<p>Sissons had another chance to put his team in front at the midway mark of the period when Pittsburgh got caught on a bad line change but he was denied by Murray on the breakaway chance.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh had two close calls in the final minute of what was the best period yet of the Final series but were denied by Predators goalie Rinne and hit a post seconds later.</p>
<p>For Nashville, the loss brought an end to a magical playoff run for the lowest seed in the Western Conference after they posted upset wins over top-seeded Chicago, division-winning Anaheim and a St. Louis squad that posted 99 points in the regular season.</p>
<p>“It stings,” said Predators defenseman P.K. Subban. “A lot of emotions, a lot of tears and there should be. Everybody cares and we obviously wanted to lift the Cup this year but it didn’t happen.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing we got to take from this is remember the feeling. Let it sink in and take it because to get back here that’s what’s going to drive us.”</p>

<p>By Martyn Herman</p>
<p>PARIS (Reuters) - Claycourt king Rafa Nadal regained his Roland Garros throne after two years in exile with a brutal 6-2 6-3 6-1 mauling of Swiss Stan Wawrinka to complete ‘La Decima’ on Sunday.</p>
<p>Rewinding the clock to the days when he was untouchable on the crushed brick dust, the 31-year-old turned 2015 champion Wawrinka into a human punchbag, winning in just over two hours.</p>
<p>This title, an unprecedented 10th at a single grand slam in the professional era, was arguably the most impressive of his 15 though as it arrived three injury-plagued years after the last one, without dropping a set and conceding only 35 games in seven matches.</p>
<p>Only Bjorn Borg, who conceded 32 on his way to the 1978 title, has been a more ruthless champion.</p>
<p>Having beaten world number one Andy Murray with a majestic display of power in the semi-final, third seed Wawrinka arrived full of confidence as, at 32, he tried to become the oldest French Open winner since Andres Gimeno in 1972.</p>
<p>But the barrel-chested ‘Stanimal’ was powerless as Nadal turned the final into an exhibition of his clayclourt supremacy ― taking his French Open record to an eye-watering 79-2.</p>
<p>As a weary Wawrinka sliced a volley into the net on match point Nadal collapsed on his back on the baseline.</p>
<p>“I’m a little emotional,” Nadal said before getting to clamp his jaws on La Coupe des Mousquetaires. “The nerves and adrenaline I feel on this court is impossible to compare.”</p>
<p>Straw hats and fans were de rigueur for an expectant Court Philippe Chatrier as the final began with temperatures hovering around the 30 degrees Celcius mark ― perfect conditions for Nadal’s trademark monstrous topspin game.</p>
<p>Wawrinka, who spent nearly five hours more on court than Nadal to reach the final, looked tentative and heavy-legged although he did have a glimmer in the third game when Nadal was forced to save a break point.</p>
<p>FIRST BLOOD</p>
<p>Nadal failed to convert any of the four break points he had in the following game, but drew first blood the next time an opportunity arose to take a 4-2 lead.</p>
<p>Then he switched on the afterburners. A matter of minutes later Wawrinka wafted a forehand long to hand Nadal a second break of serve and the opening set.</p>
<p>Wawrinka was flat, striking not a single winner off his glorious single-handed backhand in the first set, and with less than an hour on the clock his task already looked forlorn.</p>
<p>Nadal was given a time violation warning at the start of the second, but Wawrinka could not halt his charge as the Spaniard bounded into a 3-0 lead in the second having won seven games in a row.</p>
<p>With the crowd attempting to lift Wawrinka he stopped the rot to hold, firing himself up with a roar of “C’mon”.</p>
<p>Nadal was relentless though, pinning Wawrinka back behind the baseline. Even when he was stretched the response was emphatic, one astonishing forehand, whipped from close to the front row of seats to land in the corner, drawing gasps from the crowd and applause from Wawrinka.</p>
<p>Social media lit up at that point with women’s semi-finalist Timea Bacsinszky tweeting “OMG!”</p>
<p>Wawrinka could not lay a glove on Nadal and his frustration boiled over as the Spaniard closed in on a two-set lead, destroying his racket frame after a missed forehand.</p>
<p>After Nadal sealed the second set both players left the court while court staff watered down the red dust.</p>
<p>Nothing could extinguish Nadal’s fire though and he surged two breaks ahead in the third set despite the best efforts of Wawrinka to try and extend the contest.</p>

<p>Charles Barkley revealed Friday night that he’s going to attend a “fat farm” in San Antonio, Texas, to lose weight. </p>
<p>The former basketball star told his TNT cohosts on “Inside The NBA” that he would be taking six weeks off to focus on his weight and overall health.</p>
<p>Barkley discussed his personal struggle with his body during the NBA finals post-game report.</p>
<p>“Listen, I am embarrassed about how fat I have become,” he said. “I have become lazy. Number one, I’m not healthy.”</p>
<p>Barkley’s cohosts were surprised, remarking that they thought he was just going on a vacation. The panelists were unsure as to whether he was being serious, but he insisted that he wanted to get fit again.</p>
<p>“I’m taking the next six weeks to get my fat ass in shape,” he said. “Not around anything. So, I don’t drink, I gotta eat healthy, and I gotta work out. So, I’m disappearing until I see y’all.”</p>
<p>The sports legend already lost 27 pounds back in 2011, when he became a spokesman for Weight Watchers “Lose Like a Man” program.</p>
<p>Barkley has been open about his body struggles, which he has said began after the Houston Rockets gave him a pay cut to help bring Scottie Pippen on the team. The former power forward told Bill Simmons on “Any Given Sunday” last year that the cut was less than he had agreed on, and it left him feeling unmotivated. </p>
<p>“The only year that I was fat was my last year in Houston, because they had promised me $12 million,” Barkley told Simmons. “When I showed up, the contract was only for $8 million. And I said, ‘What happened to my other $4 million?’ They said, ‘Well, we just decided to keep it.’”</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns against “fad” diets. Instead, it recommends that weight loss comes from a lifestyle change that includes “healthy eating, regular physical activity, and balancing the number of calories you consume with the number of calories your body uses.” </p>

Tures, ContributorProfessor of Political Science, LaGrange College">
<p>As Sports Talk Radio broke the news of Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops’ retirement, speculation was rampant that he was in ill health, or was being relieved because of players behaving badly. They praised Stoops for winning the National Championship in 2000, and talked about how strong the team is looking for next year. They overlooked Stoops’ finest moment: leading his team to take a big stand against racism in 2015.</p>
<p>Back in 2015, a video surfaced that showed members of Oklahoma University’s chapter of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) led a horribly racist chant on their bus, according to Alejandro Danois with Bleacher Report. It through the OU into the crisis, threatening to have the campus turn into so many others schools with racial strife, like the University of Missouri, Yale University, Emory University, etc.</p>
<p>Stoops responded with his players in a protest against the racism, according to Greg Couch with Bleacher Report. He and more than 100 of his teammates gathered at the statue of former OU Coach Barry Switzer. Ty Darlington, one of his players, led the group in a prayer, according to Graham Watson with Yahoo Sports. They were also joined by OU Basketball Coach Lon Kruger.</p>
<p>Others on campus joined in the protest. OU President David Boren also suspended the fraternity, had them move out, and began an investigation. It was the school’s finest hour under Bob Stoops.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that Stoops wasn’t so great at winning the National Championship, which they captured against Florida State University in 2000, prevailing against the Seminoles 13-2. At the time, I was graduating from FSU (Class of 2000) with my doctorate, and badly wanted my team to repeat as #1. But the Sooners won an impressive defensive battle against the defending National Champions. They earned their victory.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that Stoops didn’t have a career full of amazing highlights, according to Sam Cooper with Yahoo Sports. He took over a program that had several straight losing seasons, and was the two-time Walter Camp Coach of the Year (2000, 2003). More than 13 times in his years, his team won 10 or more games in his 18 years, amassing a record of 190-48 that is unsurpassed in school history. He also won 10 Big 12 Championships, while no one else in the Big 12 won more than 12.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that Stoops didn’t have some problems. Certainly there was the terrible incident involving Oklahoma Running Back Joe Mixon and the violence he was involved in. QB Blake Mayfield showed some lack of discipline in his charges for alcohol-related incidents, and other problems his players had, leading to speculation that this might have played a role in his retirement.</p>
<p>Of course, there could be some incident like terrible one involving child abuse that plagued Penn State under Joe Paterno, or a scandal like the one that brought down Ohio State University’s Jim Tressel, or personal practices that upended Bobby Petrino at the University of Arkansas. If so, it was something we were unaware of at the time of Stoops’ record.</p>
<p>But assuming there’s no dark secret, then Stoops really should be honored, not just for his impressive accomplishments as a coach. He needs to be lauded for leading his team in a stand against racism, which will hopefully inspire other coaches to do the same.</p>

<p>   LeBron James and Kevin Durant, superstar opponents in the ongoing NBA Finals, were quite the rap team back in the day. A song apparently recorded by the two in 2011 has been leaked, Sports Illustrated reported Tuesday. Listen to the “secret” clip below. It sure sounds like the NBA greats, doesn’t it? We dig the track’s dig at columnist and broadcaster Skip Bayless:   </p>
<p>Spider Studios, a Cleveland recording studio, has also promised to release the full track if it gets enough retweets.</p>
<p>ESPN got the ball rolling Monday when it reported on the existence of the collaboration. The two players were working out in Akron, Ohio, during the NBA lockout when they decided to hit the recording studio, the sports network noted. The players confirmed they performed the hip-hop duet back then, and a former agent for both told ESPN that he heard it. But it wasn’t likely to ever be heard by the masses.</p>
<p>Anyway, we figure both players might be a tad busy at the moment to worry about their music careers.</p>

<p>Internationally renowned multi-platinum recording artist and acclaimed actor, Billy Ray Cyrus, is marking a milestone this year with the 25th anniversary of his debut album Some Gave All, which debuted in Billboard at No. 1, remaining on the charts for 17 weeks in 1992. The lead single from the album, "Achy Breaky Heart," became a phenomenon as the single went multi-platinum. Recently, he re-recorded “Achy Breaky Heart” in Muscle Shoals to celebrate the 25th anniversary. Later this summer, his CMT comedy series Still the King returns for an all-new season Tuesday, July 11 at 10pm ET/PT, and now, the music icon is celebrating the Nashville Predators as the team advances in the Stanley Cup Finals with a rally song, "Bring the Stanley Cup to Tennessee"! </p>
<p>A free download of “Bring The Stanley Cup To Tennessee” is available at BillyRayCyrus.com.</p>
<p>A Conversation with Billy Ray Cyrus</p>
<p>Mike Ragogna: Billy Ray, is this how your new song "Bring the Stanley Cup to Tennessee” goes? [sings]</p>
<p>Billy Ray Cyrus: Man, you already got the melody!</p>
<p>MR: [laughs] </p>
<p>BRC: You learned the song...you know, the greatest compliment you can give a singer-songwriter is to sing the song back and learn the melody and the words. Carl Perkins told me that without a doubt, you have got to have somebody to sing to listen to dance to be moved, by the music and that’s the common denominator between the people, the songs, the singer and the instrument. Its all about the music.</p>
<p>MR: So you must be stoked about the Predators’ chances.</p>
<p>BRC: Yes, you can just imagine! The closest thing I’ve come to actually living through something even similar is growing up, in Flatwoods, Kentucky. We were all big Cincinnati Reds fans. There’s an excitement and energy and the people become part of the team. It’s an enthusiasm that just takes over an area and city and it has absolutely. Nashville is Smashville!</p>
<p>MR: What do you think their chances are? I mean the Penguins are pretty awesome, too. </p>
<p>BRC: Hey, here’s what I think, man. Number one, the Nashville Predators, for years, have really pitched in many times behind the scene and helped our community, helped out the town, helped the children, helped homeless veterans... They’re great community players first and foremost. Second, every great comeback starts one goal at a time. You don’t start a comeback looking at it like, “Okay we are down, we got to win two.” You don’t look at it that way. You look at it like, “Okay, lets drop this puck, and let’s play hard and have fun and let’s play one puck at a time, one goal at a time,” and that’s the exact formula that every great comeback has started at. It’s one goal at a time.</p>
<p>MR: Did you play the song for the team yet?</p>
<p>BRC: I do believe that is happening as we speak. We were on the Fox morning show, which is highly rated, maybe number one in the market, and we played it on the air. I guess you probably know that the song is not even two days old yet, it’s actually thirty-three hours old at this moment [Note: This interview occurred 9:30 CT on 6/2]. I’m living here in Tennessee and I too am caught up in the enthusiasm and the insanity and the good kind of crazy that is around this town at this moment with our Nashville Predators. It’s a thing. It’s a big thing. Meanwhile my brother sends me a text message asking me if I would like to go to Tootsies bar and be with the Stanley Cup and a catfish and I go, “Wait a minute...” and I go. This is the weirdest text I have ever received and I’m reading it and my spirit just instantly said, “Yes, I’m suppose to go.”</p>
<p>Long story short, I did what songwriters do before they go to Tootsies—they write a song and write a song about what they’re feeling, what they’re living, and what other people are living. And it’s a song that can translate to other human beings. For me, the song that poured out was “Bring the Stanley Cup to Tennessee.” I hit “record” and I just sang what I was hearing and played it and that was the melody and song. I stopped the recording and sent it to my engineer and he started building me a track. I left for Tootsies, went and sang the song, and the audience immediately just started singing along with every word. The Stanley Cup is on the stage, a catfish is on the stage, we sing it, I left Tootsies, went to the studio, put my vocals on, and now here I am thirty-three hours later, and this record is red hot!</p>
<p>MR: Before we talk about things like your TV show Still the King and the Bootsie Collins remix of your hit “Achy Breaky Heart,” what other musical projects are you working on? Like are you writing and recording new music for an album? </p>
<p>BRC: Hey, can I be honest with you man? It’s been so refreshing, like you mentioned Still the King and other things for me as a songwriter to go back to what started it all. I bought a guitar, I started a band, I was a singer-songwriter, I was writing what I was feeling and what I was hearing in my spirit and in my soul and I just went back to that. And I went back to that, Mike. I cant stop. I’m writing a song every single day, songs that I love. I think I’m maybe thirty-some songs deep right now on new stuff that I’ve been writing over the last 45 days. Maybe yesterday will be the last one. If it is, that’s fine. I’ve got about seven to eight already recorded. Two to three are in the early episodes of Still the King and the new season is coming out this summer. You’ll hear some of the new music in Still the King. And season two had “I Want My Mullet Back.”</p>
<p>MR: Right, and it’s great that song became a fun classic for you.</p>
<p>BRC: “I Want My Mullet Back” has been there forever but, my God, it has found its place and its time in Still the King with Vernon and with hockey, since a mullet is also called “hockey hair,” you know like, its tradition.</p>
<p>MR: And now it’s time for that Bootsy Collins “Achy Breaky Heart” remix story!</p>
<p>BRC: Dude, from what I’m reading and what I’m hearing, people are really digging it around the world and they are freaking out. That EDM track actually came out of an Avicii camp. One of Avicii's young geniuses over there at his camp put the EDM to me—Bootsy and Buck 22—and what you’re hearing is a whole combination that came together musically at a time period, where I’m just leaning into the music right now, Mike. I’m trying to keep it real and enjoy being that musician. You know the feeling. </p>
<p>MR: Your tribute to the military, “Some Gave All,” celebrates a twenty-fifth anniversary this year. How are you looking at that song twenty-five years later? And how do you feel with have being associated with such a classic.</p>
<p>BRC: Will you do me a favor? When you hang up, I want you look up my tribute to the fallen Blue Angel this morning.</p>
<p>MR: I saw it, Billy Ray.</p>
<p>BRC: That wasn't even in the conversation when I went there. That was just a very spontaneous moment that unfolded before my eyes, because it just so happens that a year a go, I landed at Signature, the smaller airport in Nashville, and a lot of his comrades where there as a congregation. They all had very heavy hearts and there were several that shook my hand and referenced “Some Gave All.” I felt attached and involved, you know what I mean? My heart was heavy and that’s what I wrote the song about.</p>
<p>I realized that this is where it all began, man. I started as a singer songwriter writing about the truth and sometimes you can have fun with a song and sometimes you have to lay it on the line. That’s what “Some Gave All” was about.</p>
<p>MR: We mentioned Still the King earlier. How’s it going?</p>
<p>BRC: I can’t wait for July 11 when you can crank your TV up to CMT and start watching season two! Our writers and cast and our partners at CMT and Viacom put together an amazing team to make a really, really fun, smart, yet insanely stupid show that is just...its everything. It really has everything this season; its the insanity of it. I laugh all the time to think how lucky I am and whether we go to season three or stop at season two, its twenty-six more episodes than I ever thought I would do. I’ve had a blast getting paid for things that normally I would go to jail for.</p>
<p>MR: [laughs] Billy Ray, what advice do you have for new artists?</p>
<p>BRC: Well, its kind of like I said about hockey; its the same thing, man. You play life like you play hockey, one goal at a time. You just stay focused. You be the best you can be, believe that you can win, you chart a course just like hockey and the coach has a game plan. You chart a game plan to reach your dreams and you have to realize that inevitably, failure will play a huge role in your success. You have to fail to succeed. Its an important part of the equation. Thomas Edison said every time you fail, you’re one way closer to that one way that will work. Every time you fail, you eliminate one way that won’t work, therefore, you’ll be closer to the one way that will. You just play one goal at a time and stay focused and when things happen unexpectedly and you find yourself down 0-to-2, you make adjustments. That’s what life is. That’s what your goal is. And that’s what hockey is.</p>

<p>Mountain climber Alex Honnold defied death and made history at California’s Yosemite National Park ― and he did it all in under four hours. </p>
<p>The 31-year-old elite climber on Saturday became the first person to scale the nearly 3,000-foot face of Yosemite’s El Capitan granite formation without ropes or safety gear, an act known in mountaineering as free-soloing.</p>
<p>Take a virtual tour of Yosemite’s El Capitan via Google Maps</p>
<p>National Geographic, which exclusively reported Honnold’s ascent, called it perhaps “the greatest feat of pure rock climbing in the history of the sport.” Fellow elite climber Tommy Caldwell had another way of describing Honnold’s feat:</p>
<p>“This is the ‘moon landing’ of free-soloing,” Caldwell told National Geographic. Caldwell would know difficulty: In 2015, with a partner and safety gear, he scaled the Dawn Wall, considered El Capitan’s most difficult route.</p>
<p>After Honnold completed his climb in 3 hours and 56 minutes, he shared a photo of his climb via Facebook and said he was “so stoked to realize a life dream today.”</p>
<p>A free-solo climb on the smooth granite face roughly a half-mile high means there’s no margin for error; a misplaced foot could spell death, which Honnold is well aware of. </p>
<p>What’s unique about the climber is his unmatched ability to control his fear ― a feat so strong neuroscientists have studied parts of his brain, according to National Geographic. </p>
<p>“With free-soloing, obviously I know that I’m in danger, but feeling fearful while I’m up there is not helping me in any way,” Honnold told the magazine. “It’s only hindering my performance, so I just set it aside and leave it be.”</p>
<p>He told National Geographic in January that he fears death as much as anyone, but simply has “more of an acceptance that I will die at some point.”</p>
<p>When it came to preparing for his climb, Honnold followed an intense training regimen that included hanging by his fingertips and doing one-arm pull-ups in the converted van he lives in. He also began memorizing the path ― and thus each hand and foothold along El Capitan’s “Freerider” route ― at least two years ago. </p>
<p>Video of Honnold’s climb will be part of an upcoming National Geographic feature.</p>
<p>Correction: An earlier version described El Capitan as roughly a mile and-a-half high. It’s roughly a half-mile high. </p>

<p>Jack O’Neill, a pioneer in wetsuit technology and founder of the iconic California surf brand, died of natural causes Friday at the age of 94, the Orange County Register reported.</p>
<p>Friends of the Santa Cruz local confirmed his death to Monterey news station KSBW 8 on Friday.</p>
<p>For those who don’t surf, O’Neill’s name is still recognizable as the popular surf brand with a wave-like logo seen on T-shirts, sweatshirts and board shorts, usually worn by anyone who can appreciate a beach-centered lifestyle. </p>
<p>For those who do surf, however, O’Neill was an innovator of the sport and a true soul surfer. He was known as the eye patch-wearing pioneer (his eye was injured in a surfing accident) who created one of the first neoprene-based wetsuits, which allowed surfers to remain in cold water much longer, according to the O.C. Register.</p>
<p>While others have claimed to have invented the wetsuit, it is O’Neill who is widely credited with expanding surf culture into the colder coastal areas of the world.</p>
<p>In 1952, O’Neill opened a small surf shop at Ocean Beach in San Francisco ― a first for the area ― and looked for ways to stay warm in Northern California’s chilly waters, San Francisco Gate reported. While working on the neoprene-based wetsuit, O’Neill moved his shop south to Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>“I thought that I’d have a little shop on the beach and some people to surf with. But I kept up on the neoprene wetsuit and I soon got letters from around the world ― people who were interested in staying warm in the water,” O’Neill said in a 2012 interview with surf news site Surfline.</p>
<p>“Nobody is more surprised than I am how it’s grown,” he said of his invention.</p>
<p>Surf brands and wetsuit makers still use neoprene. O’Neill, as a brand, has branched into men’s and women’s athletic wear, lifestyle clothing and swimsuits. In 1996, O’Neill, the surfer, founded the O’Neill Sea Odyssey, a youth program that teaches environmental and marine conservation.</p>
<p>In an interview with RedBull TV published in December, O’Neill revealed what he values most: “The three most important things in life are surf, surf and surf.”</p>
<p>O’Neill celebrated his 94th birthday on March 27. He died at home surrounded by family, according to KSBW 8.</p>

<p>New video footage shows how badly Tiger Woods reacted to the combination of medications that he says led to his DUI arrest on Monday.</p>
<p>In the above video that the Palm Beach Post published Friday, the golf great moves slowly and appears dazed as police officers administer a breathalyzer test on him. Woods can be seen slumping over while seated in a chair before the test.</p>
<p>After completing the first test, an official tells Woods he can take a seat before the next one. However, he remains standing, wobbling, then leaning against a wall for support. </p>
<p>At 6:25 in the video, Woods walks toward the officer and says, “I can’t unlock my two bracelets.” He then turns around to show the officers his hands. The officials laugh and tell him they’ll take the handcuffs off soon.</p>
<p>The breathalyzer tests took place almost two hours after Woods’ initial arrest.</p>
<p>Days after police arrested him on suspicion of driving under the influence, Woods explained in a statement that his bizarre behavior was caused by an “unexpected reaction to prescribed medications” ― not alcohol.</p>
<p>The breathalyzer results appear to support his claim: Woods scored .000 on two different tests, according to Sports Illustrated. Among the medications that Woods told police he had taken was the opioid pain reliever Vicodin. </p>
<p>The golfer apologized and took responsibility for his actions, vowing to “do everything in my power to ensure this never happens again.”</p>
<p>Woods had his fourth back surgery in April, which will keep him from golfing competitively for the rest of the year.</p>

<p>When Spanish tennis player Nicolás Almagro broke down after a recurring knee injury again forced him to quit a major tournament mid-match, his opponent stepped up.</p>
<p>Argentina’s Juan Martín del Potro went over to Almagro at the Roland Garros stadium in Paris Thursday to hug the player, who was inconsolable over exiting the French Open.</p>
<p>Del Potro then helped him off the court and sat on the sidelines with Almagro to comfort him further. </p>
<p>Almagro and del Potro were tied with one set apiece during the second round of the grand slam tournament on Thursday.</p>
<p>As the pair competed for the win, Almagro’s knee gave out, and he was left with no choice but to forfeit the match and exit the tournament. </p>
<p>Instead of just observing the moment and moving on into the third round, del Potro went to his opponent’s side, requested water, helped him off the court and shared words of support on the sideline.</p>
<p>“I told him that tennis is important, but health matters more than tennis in this case, because I want him to be out of his bad patch,” del Potro said after the match.</p>
<p>Del Potro, who was due to face Britain’s Andy Murray on Saturday, has suffered from his fair share of injuries as well. The Argentinian player almost skipped the French Open due to back and shoulder issues, according to the Telegraph.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Almagro’s knee caused him to stop playing against compatriot Rafael Nadal during the Italian Open. The injury occurred early in the first set, less than half-hour into playing.</p>

<p>The New York Mets issued an apology on Wednesday after Mr. Met flipped off fans following a 7-1 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers.</p>
<p>Twitter user Tony T said he was “reaching over for a high five” when the iconic mascot responded not with five fingers... but one: </p>
<p>Mr. Met doesn’t have five fingers. He has four, so technically he cannot flip the middle one. But given the panache with which he delivered the gesture, he was certainly not inviting fans to step right up and greet the Mets. </p>
<p>The team quickly apologized: </p>
<p>Mr. Met may have just been expressing some frustration for a team that entered the season with high hopes then dropped to 23-28. The Mets have had to contend with a series of injuries as well as an incident in which star pitcher Matt Harvey was suspended for not showing up for a game earlier in May. (Harvey had been out late the night before and played golf in the morning.) </p>
<p>The gesture went viral online and landed the mascot on the back page of the New York Daily News: </p>
<p>The team said the person involved in the incident won’t be appearing as Mr. Met again, The Associated Press reported. On Twitter, fans were largely united behind the mascot: </p>

<p>Indianapolis 500 winner Takuma Sato is speaking out about the racist tweet posted by a former writer of the Denver Post.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Sato became the first driver from Japan to win the Indy 500, but the accomplishment wasn’t appreciated in all quarters.</p>
<p>After the race, sports writer Terry Frei posted on Twitter that he was “uncomfortable with a Japanese driver winning the Indianapolis 500 during Memorial Day weekend.”</p>
<p>Frei later deleted the tweet, but a screenshot can be seen here:</p>
<p>On Monday, the Denver Post fired Frei and apologized for his “disrespectful and unacceptable tweet.”</p>
<p>Sato finally commented on the incident on Tuesday, telling the Associated Press that it was “unfortunate” Frei had lost his job.</p>
<p>Sato said he appreciated the support he’s received from people who considered Frei’s tweet to be inappropriate.</p>
<p>“I do respect the Denver Post decision,” Sato said.</p>
<p>Frei has apologized on Twitter, but tried to justify it by saying he had just placed flowers on the grave of his father who flew combat missions over Japan in World War II.</p>
<p>Frei’s original tweet and apology aren’t acceptable to at least one of his former co-workers at the Denver Post.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Gil Asakawa, a former executive producer at the Denver Post’s website, wrote a Facebook post wondering what Frei thought about a Japanese man running the website that featured his sports coverage.</p>
<p>“Was he ‘very uncomfortable’ with me having power over his content?” he said, before questioning whether Frei would’ve reacted the same way had a German or Italian driver won the race.  </p>

<p>LeBron James’ Los Angeles home was vandalized with a racial slur on Wednesday morning, an incident that the LAPD is investigating as a hate crime.</p>
<p>On the eve of the NBA Finals, James spoke about the incident during a press conference Wednesday afternoon. He stressed that “racism will always be a part of the world and of America” and how Americans still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>The basketball star also made reference to the murder of Emmett Till ― a 14-year-old boy who was brutally killed in 1955 after being accused of whistling at a white woman. He said the vandalism on his home immediately made him think of Till’s mother’s decision to hold an open-casket funeral so that everyone in the world could see what racist ideals had done to her son.</p>
<p>James stressed the importance of talking about race relations, finding a shred of hope in the incident for its ability to shed light on what it means to be black in America and “continue to keep the conversation going.”</p>
<p>The latter sentiment likely sounds familiar because James spoke out about racism just a few weeks ago when Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones was the target of racial slurs.</p>
<p>“Racism is gonna be a part of time forever, I believe, but I think for us, the people that have the opportunities to have a voice and people that have an opportunity to have some play on the youth that’s coming up, we have to lead them the best way we can, and we have to live with the results...” James said in response to what happened to Jones. “It’s a real, real longer conversation, but if we can keep the conversation going, I think it helps.”</p>
<p>After hearing what happened to James’ home, Jones returned the favor in speaking out and tweeted out this show of support:</p>
<p>“No matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are, no matter how many people admire you: Being black in America is tough,” James said during the conference. “We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African-Americans until we feel equal in America.”</p>
<p>James will play in his third consecutive NBA Finals with the Cleveland Cavaliers against the Golden State Warriors starting Thursday.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Major League Baseball handed down suspensions Tuesday for Washington Nationals star Bryce Harper and San Francisco Giants reliever Hunter Strickland after the two sparked a Memorial Day brawl. </p>
<p>Strickland has been suspended for six games and fined an undisclosed amount, according to MLB.com. Harper, an outfielder, received a four-game suspension and an undisclosed fine. </p>
<p>In the top of the 8th inning in Monday’s game at AT&T Park in San Francisco, Strickland hit Harper with a 98 mph fastball on the hip. Harper pointed his bat at the Giants pitcher, charged the mound and hurled his batting helmet at Strickland, which sailed way wide.</p>
<p>Strickland and Harper each landed solid punches before the two teams met at the mound and players jostled with one another. </p>
<p>Appearing to get the worst of the melee were Giant teammates Michael Morse and Jeff Samardzija, who collided head-to-head.</p>
<p>Harper and Strickland were both ejected from the game. The Nationals went on to win the opener of a three-game series between the two teams, 3-0. </p>
<p>It was unclear whether Strickland intended to hit Harper. But the last time the two met, during the 2014 division playoff series, Harper belted home runs off Strickland in two separate games.</p>
<p>“History,” said F.P. Santangelo, an analyst for the National’s broadcast team, just as Harper was hit. “And that was intentional to my mind,” Santangelo added as the brawl ensued. </p>
<p>Before the Nationals departed for a West Coast swing, Harper ― a four-time All-Star and winner of the National League MVP ― told a group of Washington-area youth baseball players over the weekend that there are “no participation trophies, OK? First place only.” </p>
<p>This article has been updated to reflect the suspensions of the two players. </p>

<p>Michael Bennett is of the NFL’s good guys.</p>
<p>When teammate Cliff Avril ran a race last weekend to help raise money for juvenile Diabetes research, Bennett was there all day to offer his help. When Avril went to Haiti to build schools and help provide clean water, Bennett was there with his sleeves rolled up. He also takes many opportunities to visit juvenile detention centers and speak with kids.</p>
<p>And, when former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick stunned sports fans by kneeling during the national anthem, Bennett decided to sit down ― with law enforcement and community leaders in Seattle to learn about what he could constructively do to help answer questions about race.</p>
<p>This is why it’s surprising to see how Bennett has drawn the ire of prominent sports journalists, including ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith, as well as a local sports columnist. It’s unfair that his name was dragged through the mud. Bennett is a unique person and by all accounts a great person ― and he has done nothing wrong.</p>
<p>In an article published two weeks ago in The Seattle Times, Matt Calkins heavily criticized the Seattle Seahawks star defensive end for lashing out at a local TV reporter who was questioning him after a game. Calkins didn’t contact the TV reporter before publishing his column. If he had, he would have found out Bennett had privately apologized to him. Calkins penned an apology when he realized his mistake ― but the damage was done.</p>
<p>Bennett, who plays one of the league’s most violent positions, is one of its most gentle and caring people. The former undrafted free agent is a highly dedicated member of the community and one of the team’s most respected members.</p>
<p>“Mike is a special person because he won’t let anyone change his opinion on what really matters,” Avril told me via text. “He will speak his mind no matter what! A lot of times athletes are afraid to voice their opinion because they want to be ‘politically correct.’ He wants to show that he’s human just like the next but won’t change who he is because he’s a professional athlete!”</p>
<p>“I love the heck out of him,” Seahawks coach Pete Carroll told me during the season. “Terrific team player.”</p>
<p>Bennett ― whose family foundation helps prevent childhood obesity ― has told me several times that it saddens him to see children suffering. That’s why he goes to the detention centers and why he speaks “with” the troubled youth, not “at” them, he says. </p>
<p>In March, the 31-year-old Bennett announced that he would donate 100 percent of his endorsements to helping minority communities and empowering women of color. Additionally, he will also donate half of his jersey sales to inner-city garden projects.</p>
<p>“I was inspired by Chance the Rapper to ‘think bigger’ when he pledged one million dollars to Chicago kids and their school system,” Bennett said in a statement, according to ESPN. “So, I’ll be joining him by investing in the future of our youth. The system is failing our kids, and it will be up to the community and our leaders to help keep the hope alive by focusing on improving our education system and the future of our kids.”</p>
<p>Professional athletes are under a social microscope. We expect them to make great plays and help “our teams” win games. But we also turn on them easily for things we perceive as mistakes.</p>
<p>After Bennett supported the Seahawks’ potential signing of quarterback Colin Kaepernick, ESPN pundit Stephen A. Smith torched him for it. But Bennett didn’t remain idle.</p>
<p>“I know by responding to you I’m just making your job easier by giving you something else to yell about tomorrow, but you are spreading so much ignorance that it’s hard to be silent,” he wrote on Instagram. “You tell us we don’t know anything, but we stand alongside people who have dedicated their lives to try and make change. We’re stepping out on our platform to make a real, substantial impact, while you play the clown.”</p>
<p>     Richard Sherman, the four-time All-Pro cornerback of the Seahawks ― and someone who is also making a great impact in the community ― believes in Bennett and his conviction, even when it’s not the popular stance.     </p>
<p>     “Mike is a man of integrity,” Sherman tells me via text. “He doesn’t need to put up a front or manifest anything. He is incredibly sharp and informed. The respect that he has from his teammates and coaches stems from how hard he works and what he stands for. As a man. As a father. As a teammate. As a brother. As a friend. He gives everything he has.”     </p>
<p>Justin Tuck is a two-time Super Bowl champion, former All-Pro and like Sherman, a close friend of Bennett’s. He understands the significance of his friend’s message, even if it’s not always the most popular approach.</p>
<p>“Recently I’ve had opportunities to see how passionate he is about change,” Tuck told HuffPost. “I think a lot of times he’s misunderstood because he’s brash in the way he goes about it. He’s also very educated and understands the impact he can have because of his platform. I think he’s utilizing it well.”</p>
<p>“Athletes sometimes do the popular thing,” Tuck added. “Mike understands these issues.”</p>
<p>Bennett’s honesty and conviction might scare people, but sports fans ― even those who disagree with his opinions ― should be promoting it. What matters is that Bennett doesn’t merely have an opinion, but he believes in it strongly enough to stand up for himself.</p>
<p>“I love the city of Seattle,” Bennett told me via text. “I will continue to be an outstanding member and do it organically. But if that makes me unliked I will still do it. I want to change the game on and off the field.”</p>

<p>So, what’s shakin’ at the French Open? Not hands, apparently.</p>
<p>Watch Laurent Lokoli of France refuse to press flesh with the victorious Martin Klizan of Slovakia after their first-round match on Tuesday. Lokoli threw in a finger-wag and dismissive wave for theatrical effect.</p>
<p>Some fans booed, but we can’t totally blame Lokoli. According to Deadspin, Klizan had reacted earlier to a game-ending Lokoli double fault by yelling in triumph and then pointing at his brain, perhaps to signify the pressure had gone to Lokoli’s head to make such a mental mistake.</p>
<p>Not cool either.</p>
<p>The two also argued on the sideline, with Lokoli accusing Klizan of faking a leg injury, the Telegraph reported. He also said Klizan disrespected him.</p>
<p>Bad blood all around, it seems.</p>
<p>So while Klizan got the five-set victory, maybe we can call the bad sportsmanship competition a draw.</p>

<p>While some psychologists champion the merit of participation trophies in sports, baseball great Bryce Harper declared he is no fan of them.</p>
<p>The Washington Nationals star told a group of youth baseball players on Saturday that awards for merely playing the game are a no-win situation.</p>
<p>“As much as they might tell you, ‘Oh, it’s OK you guys lost,’ but no, Johnny, no. No participation trophies, OK? First place only,” he said in a Q&A with youngsters from the D.C. area. </p>
<p>Here’s the exchange: </p>
<p>Harper got laughter and applause, so apparently the message hit home somehow.</p>
<p>At age 24, Harper is already a four-time All-Star and winner of the National League MVP award and is set to earn more than $21 million next season.</p>
<p>He, for one, probably has no use for a participation trophy.</p>

Wu, ContributorAuthor, Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White">
<p>We fail if we do not talk to Terry Frei. He was fired as a newspaper columnist by the Denver Post after saying he was “very uncomfortable” that Takuma Sato, who came from Japan, won the Indianapolis 500 this year, the first time that has occurred. Before I bring on internet backlash, I should say with utmost clarity that I believe the journalist was wrong; he ought to be taken to task; and his termination from a role many would covet might well be the sort of signal that is effective. If he had not been fired, I would be calling for discipline.</p>
<p>My point is that for someone who believes as I do — and I reiterate, that I, an American of Asian descent, am against the hate this individual, an American of European extraction, expressed albeit in the soft form of discomfort, as if his seat in the stands did not offer enough room to stretch out — we must understand how people form and maintain these types of attitudes. Otherwise we will not be able to address them in a constructive manner. </p>
<p>The risk is that, in the vernacular, “the script will be flipped.” Frei will look as if he is the victim, because he was open in his opinions. His defenders will allude, as he has, to his own background: his father fought in World War II. No doubt he has more than a few followers on social media who share in his sentiment of uneasiness, who then will resent that someone, with whom they identify, spoke out and then was punished for his sincerity. They cannot be ignored. Frei was not, after all, proposing blatant discrimination. People will want to excuse him.</p>
<p>His surprise should be no surprise. The “Indy 500” is especially all-American, taking place in the heartland on Memorial Day weekend. It is supposed to announce summer as an ongoing celebration of white working-class heroes, including those whose family names end in vowels. This is the home of American iron at least in the mythos never mind that Honda engines are dominant nowadays. There are family dynasties, respected for their apparent traditional values. The occasional intruder seems quaint, such as Jackie Stewart. He could have been a newly-arrived cousin, dubbed “the flying Scot.”</p>
<p>Formula One, the series in which Sato developed his skills, is cosmopolitan in its paddock and global in its venues. It has not been accepted on these shores.</p>
<p>Sato was not only foreign, but also Asian. He doesn’t look like the champion we expect though he is part of the Andretti Autosport stable. In anxious times, the public yearns for reassurances. All will remain as it has been.</p>
<p>As a kid from Detroit, I have always been a “car guy.” I remember Asian American drivers at “the Brickyard,” or, more accurately, I recall a single Asian American professional behind the wheel. I liked Danny Ongais, “the flyin’ Hawaiian,” best known for a spectacular crash in 1981 when he was in the lead. I didn’t even realize his heritage; he just seemed confident in taking risks on the track.</p>
<p>The Sato-Frei incident is not isolated. Ironically, the athletes who are attacked are attacked because they are too good. What is feared is their superiority, not their inferiority. The distinctions that are drawn do not depend on citizenship either.</p>
<p>Meb, the marathoner of such stature he is recognized by first name, faced similar reactions. When he (full name Mebrahtom Keflegzighi) won the New York City Marathon in 2009, more than two decades after coming to this country as an adolescent, CNBC commentator Darren Rovell declared that he, of African origins, was only technically an American. The passport doesn’t count. The whole group of Asian female golfers, specifically Korean in descent, likewise, were described by Jan Stephenson as “killing our [LPGA] tour.” The hyperbole and the possessive are not subtle. At stake is an ethnic version of national pride. </p>
<p>Our affinities are framed positively by the more sophisticated observers. In the 1996 NCAA basketball tournament, Princeton upset UCLA in the first round of “March Madness,” 43-41. The Ivy League spoilers were old-school, playing a slow, methodical, man-to-man game. They happened to have an all-white starting roster. They were praised in terms of nostalgia, but more than one commentator wondered whether those positive feelings disguised something else, not even breaking the consciousness of those who smiled to see a team lacking a big man (that is, a big black man) at work (and literally “center”).</p>
<p>The examples are too abundant to list: the perennial “Great White Hope” in boxing; Hank Aaron receiving death threats as he approached Babe Ruth’s homerun record in baseball; and so on.</p>
<p>Rituals of competition probably make us tribal. Anthropologists tell us these contests evolved as substitutes for warfare. That is why the Nazi regime invested so much national spirit in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. They were symbolic of much more than the medals handed out to those on the podium at the finish line. African American Jesse Owens set records. He made history.</p>
<p>What offers hope, however, is that fans will cheer for players on their hometown franchise of the league regardless of background. They routinely cross the color line. Jeremy Lin was a phenomenon for all to watch. Superstar Michael Jordan is still beloved in China. </p>
<p>The business of sport is changing. People of all backgrounds participate as could not have been imagined by some (including half the population that was officially excluded on the basis of gender). Baseball would have scarce talent if it were not recruiting from Latin America and overseas. Soccer (football everywhere else) has finally become assimilated in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Yet there are those who will persist in their prejudice. We need to engage with them.</p>

<p>Frank Deford, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest sports journalists ever, has died at the age of 78.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reports that Deford died Sunday in Key West, Florida. His wife confirmed the news to the paper. </p>
<p>Born in Baltimore, Maryland, on Dec. 16, 1938, Deford attended Princeton University before landing a job at Sports Illustrated in 1962, when the magazine was still in its infancy.</p>
<p>Over the next 27 years, Deford would become one of the most celebrated sports writers in U.S. history, once even being described in GQ as “the world’s greatest sportswriter.” He was known in particular for his sweeping and lyrical magazine profiles, many of which were seen as iconic, such as “The Boxer and the Blonde,” which he considered his best piece ever. </p>
<p>“I think I would die if I couldn’t get to the typewriter every day. I really need that. I think it’s a sexual experience,” Deford once said. </p>
<p>He eventually branched out from magazines and into radio and television as well. Starting in 1980 and up until this month, he delivered memorable sports commentaries on NPR’s “Morning Edition” ― 1,656 times to be exact. And for two decades, he served as a senior correspondent for HBO’s “Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel.”</p>
<p>Over his career, his fellow sports writers voted him U.S. Sportswriter of the Year six times. In 1998, he was elected to to the Hall of Fame of the National Association of Sportscasters and Sportswriters. In 2013, President Barack Obama awarded him with the National Humanities Medal.</p>
<p>“A dedicated writer and storyteller, Mr. Deford has offered a consistent, compelling voice in print and on radio, reaching beyond scores and statistics to reveal the humanity woven into the games we love,” Obama said at the time.</p>
<p>But Deford’s interests were not limited to sports, either. He wrote more than a dozen books, many about sports and celebrity, but some of which dealt with topics such as pre-Pearl Harbor Japan and the polio epidemic. </p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, Carol, and two children, Christian and Scarlet.</p>
<p>After news of his death circulated Monday, many in the sports journalism industry and beyond wrote of their fond memories of Deford. </p>

<p>Tiger Woods, 41, was arrested in a town outside West Palm Beach, Florida, on a DUI charge early Monday morning. </p>
<p>The professional golfer took responsibility for his actions in a statement late Monday, but said an “unexpected reaction to prescribed medications,” not alcohol, led to his arrest.</p>
<p>“I didn’t realize the mix of medications had affected me so strongly,” he said. “I would like to apologize with all my heart to my family, friends and the fans. I expect more from myself too.” </p>
<p>Woods, who has been recovering from back surgery, was released from custody just before 11 a.m. Eastern time with no bond, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office. </p>
<p>A local resident, he was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. </p>
<p>This is not the first time Woods has faced legal trouble for his decisions behind the wheel.</p>
<p>In 2009, the golfer crashed his SUV into a tree in Florida, requiring his wife at the time, Elin Nordegren, to help him out of the vehicle. Although a Florida trooper suspected Woods was driving under the influence of alcohol, Woods’ blood was not tested and he did not receive a DUI charge.</p>
<p>A divorce between the golfer and Nordegren, who have two young children, was finalized in 2010. Woods was trailed by rumors of infidelity after the accident; he did a stint in rehab in 2010 as well.</p>
<p>Although his golf career has been an illustrious one ― Woods has claimed 79 PGA Tour wins, second only to Sam Snead ― his future remains in doubt. Woods underwent his fourth back surgery since 2014 in April and has been on the mend, although he expressed a desire to golf professionally again in a post on his website.</p>
<p>Woods’ management did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>This article has been updated to include Woods’ statement. </p>
<p>Chris D’Angelo contributed to this report.</p>
<p>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post said Woods’ and Nordegren’s divorce was finalized in 2016. It was 2010.</p>

<p>The word “comeback” is overused in sports, but in the case of Devon Gales, it might not be strong enough.</p>

<p>Aly Raisman, a three-time Olympic gold medalist in gymnastics, just slammed a judge.</p>
<p>And with good reason.</p>
<p>This judge wasn’t officiating a competition. He was a man at airport security apparently making unsolicited negative comments about her body.</p>
<p>It all started when a “lady at TSA” said she could tell from Raisman’s biceps that she was a gymnast, the athlete recounted on Twitter Wednesday. That’s when “a man at TSA” broke into the conversation, rudely proclaiming he didn’t see any muscles and proceeding to stare at her, according to the London and Rio Games hero.</p>
<p>“I am so sick of this judgmental generation,” she wrote.</p>
<p>We’ll let Raisman take it away from here:</p>
<p>Raisman spoke out in January about maintaining a positive body image before she appeared in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.</p>
<p>“I of course like everyone else have my days where I feel insecure and not at my best,” she wrote on Instagram with one of her S.I. photos released as a preview. “BUT I think it is that much more important we love our bodies and support each other.”</p>

<p>The most powerful 20 minutes of television Tuesday night are also likely to be the most somber: a catchup report for the American audience on the pedophilia scandal that began rattling British football last November.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s report can be seen on HBO’s Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel, 10 p.m. ET. The segment is reported by David Scott and titled Soccer’s Darkest Secret.</p>
<p>The case began with a former Premier League player, Andy Woodward, saying that during his six years in the British youth development system he was repeatedly raped by his coach, Barry Bennell. </p>
<p>Making the situation more shocking to British fans, this happened at Crewe Alexandra, one of the most respected and successful youth development teams in the country.</p>
<p>Bennell himself commanded similar respect. He had previously worked at Premier League powerhouse teams Chelsea and Manchester City. </p>
<p>At Crewe Alexandra he forged relationships with the boys’ families, telling them that their sons would develop more rapidly if they spent weekends at Bennell’s house.</p>
<p>He just didn’t specify the kind of development he had in mind.</p>
<p>Woodward, talking with Scott, says he endured the abuse and kept quiet because he was warned that if he said anything, he would lose playing time and his career prospects would nosedive. </p>
<p>Woodward’s decision to finally talk, decades later, opened an unexpected floodgate. More than 500 former youth players have come forward with similar stories, and hundreds of coaches and organizations are under investigation. </p>
<p>One of those who has now spoken out, Gary Johnson, achieved his childhood dream of playing for Chelsea, one of the Premier League’s elite franchises. He now calls that a hollow victory, because he was “shattered” inside by years of sexual abuse from chief scout Eddie Heath at Chelsea’s youth program. </p>
<p>Heath often orchestrated multi-player sexual encounters, says Johnson, and no one spoke out for the same reason Woodward kept quiet: They were afraid it would kill their career prospects in the insanely competitive youth leagues. </p>
<p>It all sounds like a superversion of sexual scandals in U.S. sports programs, and it was appropriately shocking news in Britain, where football rules as the national sport and obsession. It has been headline news since Woodward stepped forward. </p>
<p>Viewers in the U.S. may be equally interested, if not surprised, when Soccer’s Darkest Secret notes two further disturbing aspects of the story. </p>
<p>Both involve the potential culpability of the organizations that were in the business of supervising the teams where this abuse took place. </p>
<p>Scott talks with an identity-protected former employee of Crewe Alexandra who says that in 2001 he went to the Football Association (FA), Britain’s ruling soccer authority, and warned about a potential pedophilia scandal. </p>
<p>In return, he received a one-sentence reply telling him the FA had investigated and “there is no case to answer.” The FA also subsequently terminated a study on child protection before it was concluded, citing “budget cuts.” </p>
<p>Since Woodward came forward, the FA has suspended several coaches suspected of pedophilia. But the former Crewe employee says he suspects both the team and the FA are still trying to minimize the damaging scandal. </p>
<p>He notes that the official who apparently refused to seriously investigate Bennell — now a convicted serial child sex abuser — today is chairman of Crewe Alexandra.</p>
<p>While the focus of Darkest Secret remains on the sexual abuse itself, and how something this widespread could have continued for years, it also notes the subsequent impact on the victims’ lives. </p>
<p>Alcoholism, depression, bad relationships and suicide attempts seem to have been troublingly if unsurprisingly frequent. </p>
<p>“At no point has anyone on that football club spoken out,” says Woodward. “Not even we’re sorry for what you’ve been through.”</p>

<p>After two straight home losses for D.C. United to Montreal and Philadelphia, it was the turn of Bastian Schweinsteiger and the Chicago Fire to roll into town. After failing to score in their last two games, and with Luis Acosta suspended after his sending off the previous week, United went with both Patrick Mullins and Sebastien Le Toux up front for the first time. It didn’t make a difference, as United, once again, failed to score.</p>
<p>The first half of the game was full of end to end attacking</p>
<p>...with neither side managing to secure an advantage, and Schweinsteiger showing that he’s still more than good enough to play top level football.</p>
<p>Bill Hamid, in the United goal, was called upon on several occasions to keep the ball out of the back of the net.</p>
<p>United continued to press, in their best half of this three-game home stand.</p>
<p>...while throwing themselves into tackles to prevent Chicago from scoring.</p>
<p>But the same was true at the other end, with Chicago’s defense holding strong...</p>
<p>...and Schweinsteiger doing what he does best.</p>
<p>While Dax McCarty continued to show why the Red Bulls shouldn’t have traded him.</p>
<p>Which meant that Hamid was called upon again... </p>
<p>...and again.</p>
<p>...as Chicago went closer and closer.</p>
<p>...but still Hamid stood strong.</p>
<p>United did have their chances too, but nothing that challenged Matt Lampson in Chicago’s goal.</p>
<p>As the half wore down, Hamid made another save, to keep the score at 0-0.</p>
<p>When the second half started, it was Chicago that started out the more livelier of the teams... </p>
<p>...and in the 52nd minute David Accam slid the ball past Hamid to give Chicago a lead they’d not relinquish... </p>
<p>...which he celebrated by leaping at, and kicking the corner flag.</p>
<p>This spurred United on to attack... through Le Toux... </p>
<p>...Lloyd Sam... </p>
<p>...and Marcelo.</p>
<p>...but none of the three managed a shot on goal, despite these attacks.</p>
<p>United defender, Steve Birnbaum, did manage to actually get the ball on target, but the ball was saved by Lampson.</p>
<p>Chicago weren’t idle, they continued to attack, in some cases breaking away after a United attack, but they were unable to extend their lead.</p>
<p>United’s continued to press forward, but Chicago’s defense held strong...</p>
<p>...not allowing United access to shooting lanes.</p>
<p>Even Sam’s Karate kid impression was to no avail</p>
<p>...and while substitute Jose Guillermo Ortiz managed a shot on goal, the equalizer was not forthcoming, and Chicago took the 3 points, while United managed 0 points from their 3 home games, scoring 0 goals, with 6 against. </p>

<p>ESPN reporter Holly Rowe says her cancer has returned and spread, The Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>“I don’t think about having cancer when I’m out here,” Rowe told AP before she worked the sideline Thursday for a WNBA game between the Minnesota Lynx and host New York Liberty. “Monday, I have a CAT scan and have treatment. I’ll be a cancer patient on Monday. I’m not thinking about it today.”</p>

<p>When Derek Jeter spoke to fans at Yankee Stadium on Sunday to celebrate the retirement of his No. 2, the circumstances were dramatically different from those that surrounded another Yankee captain, Lou Gehrig, and his speech on the Fourth of July 78 years earlier.</p>
<p>The Jeter ceremony was a joyful capstone to his 20-season tenure, scheduled many months earlier. In a powder blue suit and open shirt, he looked as confident and prepared as he had while wearing Yankee pinstripes. He had no reason to weep or to sense that his happy days would end soon. He was ready for this day, having retired after the 2014 season with 3,465 lifetime hits, the adoration of millions of fans, and a rich future. He has launched the Players Tribune website that lets athletes bypass traditional media to give unfiltered accounts of their lives and married the model Hannah Davis, who is expecting their first child. And, along with former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, he is pursuing the acquisition of the Miami Marlins, who defeated the Yankees in the 2003 World Series in six games.</p>
<p>Gehrig was facing his mortality as stood before newsreel and radio microphones at the original Yankee Stadium. He had last played at the end of April 1939, with four hits in 28 at-bats and one run batted in. Once seemingly indestructible, he had played feebly. In June, a diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis at the Mayo Clinic had provided him with the reason for the rapid disappearance of the strength and physical brilliance that had made him the Iron Horse. On that hot July 4th, his uniform rippled in the breeze, as if he were shrinking inside his Yankee flannels. </p>
<p>He was too weak to hold the trophies and gifts that were given to him. </p>
<p>His replacement, Babe Dahlgren, was deputized by a worried Manager Joe McCarthy to catch him if he looked about to fall. Gehrig looked wobbly.</p>
<p>According to versions of the speech’s origin told by his wife Eleanor, Gehrig was prepared to speak to the crowd. He either wrote it on his own—or her help. He rehearsed it—but maybe he did not. As he headed to the field for the ceremony, he did not bring the text of his speech, and no copy of it has been found. </p>
<p>Through tears, he offered gratitude to his wife, parents, mother-in-law, managers, teammates and opponents. But mostly, the speech is remembered for its second line:</p>
<p>“Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.”</p>
<p>And for describing his life-altering diagnosis as merely a “bad break.”</p>
<p>Demonstrating such grace after learning that he had a disease that had ended his career and was weakening him daily remains remarkable. Months later, he explained in a syndicated article that he had was grateful for his achievements since his poverty-stricken childhood as the son of German immigrants. </p>
<p>Gehrig wrote that he had thought of himself as the “luckiest kid on earth” if he could play on the high school football team, go to college and break into major league baseball. His “bad break” would not diminish that sentiment. </p>
<p>“All right, I’m still the luckiest man on earth when you add things up,” he wrote. “I’ve got a long season of life to play out and my team—America—is absolutely the best in the league. That’s what counts.”</p>
<p>Jeter looks like he will have the “long season of life” that was denied to Gehrig. At 42, he did not look physically vulnerable. As trim as the day he ended his career with a game-winning hit, Jeter took a handheld microphone and offered his litany of thanks—to the late Yankee owner George Steinbrenner, his family, managers, coaches, teammates, support staff, and fans. He spoke with the confidence of a modern athletic superstar who shared a driven work ethic with Gehrig as well as an ability to avoid controversy. Without the sort of physical challenge that Gehrig faced, Jeter’s words lacked gravitas—as nearly every athletic goodbye delivered in a stadium or arena does.</p>
<p>If Jeter’s speech is remembered for its oratory, it may be for saying that “time flies, memories fade, but family is forever, and I’ll be eternally grateful to be a part of the Yankee family.” For completely different reasons, Jeter could have legitimately declared that he was the “luckiest man on the face of the earth.”</p>
<p>Jeter’s speech will not likely inspire great cinema. But Gehrig’s did. The producer Samuel Goldwyn was so moved by the newsreel that he agreed to make “The Pride of the Yankees.” Goldwyn knew nothing about baseball and ordained that the film focus on Gehrig’s courage and his love for Eleanor. Baseball wasn’t squeezed out of “Pride,” but on-field action was secondary, even with Babe Ruth in the cast.</p>
<p>Gary Cooper, who had never played baseball, portrayed Gehrig. Whatever batting or field skills he acquired came through the tutoring of Lefty O’Doul, a once-great hitter. Cooper was lean and lanky, unlike the brawny and muscular Gehrig. But Cooper understood how to play men of quiet dignity like Gehrig. He had been doing it for most of his career, although he was nervous about portraying someone whose memory was still indelible with baseball fans.</p>
<p>The film’s version of the speech is shorter and in many ways different from the original. The script instructed Cooper that the scene was a “crucifixion as well as triumph.” Cooper’s delivery was modest but powerful. He hesitated a few times and shed some tears.

<p>Kellyanne Conway’s comment on “alternative facts” has already gone down in political folklore.</p>
<p>It’s now being further preserved in the shape of Minnesota baseball team The St. Paul Saints’ new pig mascot — which it has named Alternative Fats, the Star Tribune reports.</p>
<p>The porker follows previous pigs Little Red Porkette, Stephen Colboar, Boarack Ohama, Kim Lardashian, Kevin Bacon, and Mackleboar as the side’s lucky charm.</p>
<p>Club officials revealed its new mascot’s name via a statement online Wednesday, which itself was packed with what are undoubtedly also alternative facts.</p>
<p>“Alternative Fats will enter the field each game like no other pig before him, with a white ground covering draped from his mansion-style pigpen to home plate for the billions of Saints fans to shower him with love and admiration,” it read.</p>
<p>“Alternative Fats will be so HUUUUGE it will make all other pigs jealous,” the press release continued, before claiming the swine would “go down in the pantheon of the greatest mascot names in the history of sports.”</p>
<p>Other suggestions not to make the cut included Boar’d of Trump, Ham Jong Un and Pigimir Putin.</p>

<p>There is a well known saying that is readily thrown around these days that goes by “Ball Is Life.” Whether it is on commercials, on social media or said on the playground, it has slowly become a lifestyle, not just a saying. This saying has been embedded in the minds of many young athletes within recent years, almost leading them to believe that they have no other choices in life. It might seem like it is just a saying, but it is not outrageous to think that it does hold some weight in the minds of many athletes, young and old.</p>
<p>As a young kid, I could definitely resonate with this as basketball was the only thing I ever saw myself wanting to do in life. Being a professional athlete was all I wanted to be. It was all I cared about, all I loved and all I put my energy into for 15 plus years of my life. I didn’t know anything else and didn’t really think about anything else. Now, as I am older and on the back end of my playing days, I find myself asking was it really “life”? I mean it was certainly worth every minute of sacrifice, pain and adversity in it all. It was worth every game, practice and relationship I built as well. I wouldn’t trade those years for the world, but I do realize that basketball wasn’t “life.” What I did for all of those years, wasn’t who I was.</p>
<p>Why Playing Ball Isn’t Life</p>
<p>I look at it now, and I’ve grown to realize the absurdity in this statement. We, as in society, push this saying around implying that if you can dribble, throw a ball or run fast, that’s all you need to make a way for yourself in this world. It seems like we’re instituting a narrative that indirectly states “the game is the only way out” or something along the lines of “if you’re not playing, you’re really not living.” Essentially it’s “do this and only this, everything else will work out.” Even when we all know that’s not really how life works at all. All this leads to is a tunnel vision mindset that leaves athletes unprepared and fearful about their lives after they’re done playing sports.</p>
<p>Nobody is ever just identified with one thing. We aren’t conformed into one persona, or defined by one instance even at a young age. Everyone has other interests, likes and passions. When we are young, we might not know how to cultivate those other interests or might not have as much fun with them as we do with sports. Maybe the case was that sports are so forced upon us and anything other than being an athlete was unacceptable. From athlete to athlete, situation to situation, or whatever the case might have been, deep down we all knew we really weren’t just athletes. We were and still are unique individuals made up of a multitude of passions and talents.</p>
<p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with riding the athlete wave through high school, college and even the pros, if you are blessed enough make it and have that opportunity. Chase your dreams. Shoot, I did it myself. Though, the one thing you cannot ride it through, is your entire life. There comes a day for every single athlete in this world, where the curtains will close and the next chapter in life begins.</p>
<p>It is for this reason alone that we have to stop feeding and giving life to this “Ball Is Life” belief. The reality is that it’s not life and never will be. It might always be a huge part of your life, but you are much bigger than a game. You are destined for greater things down the line and the most impactful gift we can give our young and even older athletes is the truth about sports. They are more than just athletes. They are people who are made up of many traits, skills and identities. Being a multi-faceted and well rounded athlete will always be more interesting and appealing to anyone you come into contact with for the rest of your life anyway. You have to give yourself a chance to develop in other areas of life. If you don’t, you’ll regret it. Trust me, your life almost depends on it.</p>

<p>The son of an NBA legend has filed a lawsuit against James Harden alleging that the Houston Rockets star orchestrated a robbery against him, according to Fox 26 in Houston. </p>
<p>Moses Malone Jr., the son of former Rockets center and Hall of Famer Moses Malone, claims that Harden paid $20,000 for a group of men to assault and rob him because of a Facebook post he wrote criticizing Harden for charging children to attend his basketball camp. </p>
<p>Isiah Carey of Fox 26 broke news of the lawsuit against Harden on Instagram: </p>
<p>The incident in question occurred outside of the V-Live strip club in Houston in June of 2016. Malone said he was beaten up by men with guns and robbed of $15,000 in jewelry, his cellphone, car keys and a credit card, according to the Washington Post.</p>
<p>Four people were charged in connection with the attack, ABC 13 reported.</p>
<p>Harden has not been charged with any crime and a representative for the club, Carl A. Moore, said that he did not believe the basketball player had any connection to the attack.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe Mr. Harden was at the club, and I definitely don’t believe he had anything to do with an attack on Mr. Malone,” Moore said.</p>
<p>Malone’s lawyer said that the suspects were angry about Malone’s Facebook post criticizing Harden for charging $249 per child at his basketball camp.</p>
<p>Kaitlin McCulley, of ABC-13, tweeted a screen grab of that Facebook post:</p>
<p>Rusty Hardin, the attorney for James Harden, told Fox 26 reporter Carey that he is “totally comfortable that the allegations are untrue.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I am afraid this is just another example of people shopping for a deep pocket when they find that the people actually responsible have no money,” he added.</p>
<p>Despite Harden’s stellar season, he and the Rockets were ousted from the playoffs in embarrassing fashion by the San Antonio Spurs last week.</p>
<p>HuffPost’s request for comment from the Houston Rockets was not immediately returned.</p>

<p>Pass the mic. An ESPN broadcaster will become the first woman in 30 years to call play-by-play for an NFL regular season game, Sports Illustrated reported Sunday.</p>
<p>The outlet, citing multiple sources, said Beth Mowins will call ESPN’s Monday Night Football game between the Los Angeles Chargers and host Denver Broncos on Sept. 11. Former NFL coach Rex Ryan will likely serve as the analyst.</p>
<p>Mowins joined the sports network in 1994 and has called college football broadcasts since 2005, according to her ESPN bio. In addition, she served as the main person in the booth for the Raiders’ local preseason broadcasts for the last two seasons.</p>
<p>“I am more than confident Beth can call an NFL game for a national audience,” Vittorio De Bartolo, executive producer of broadcasting for the Raiders, told SI.</p>
<p>It’s about time.</p>
<p>Gayle Sierens was the last and only woman to call play-by-play for a regular season NFL game, leading the NBC booth on Dec. 27, 1987, for a Seahawks-Chiefs matchup. The New York Times noted previously that the network asked her back for six more games, but Sierens said the local news station where she served as a full-time anchor feared the football gig would interfere with her regular job.</p>
<p>“I used to say that I kicked down the door, but no one else came in,” Sierens told the Times in 2009. “But I think that day is nearing. I really do.”</p>
<p>Apparently, the day is finally here.</p>

Tures, ContributorProfessor of Political Science, LaGrange College">
<p>Last night, the San Antonio Spurs had a game for the ages in the NBA, shutting down Houston’s MVP candidate James Harden. But in doing so, they may have also cost their best player, the injured Kawhi Leonard, his chance at winning his first MVP Award.</p>
<p>Lacking two of their biggest stars, a year after the franchise’s best player retired, the Spurs closed out the Houston Rockets in six games on the road with a 39 point win in the Western Semifinal Series. In doing so, they held James Harden of the Houston Rockets to perhaps his worst game as a professional basketball player.</p>
<p>And the statistics don’t tell the whole tale. The highly-talented Harden of Houston looked confused and lost, making all kinds of turnovers and mental mistakes. In fact, the entire Rockets team looked as though they were stuck in a bad dream.</p>
<p>That’s because Houston was supposed to be the easy winners. They humiliated the Spurs early in the series to take away home court advantage. San Antonio had to play their best game just to win game 2, and then fight hard to take back the series initiative, winning one of two in Houston. In Game 5, ageless Argentinian Guard Manu Ginobili blocked a Harden three-point attempt to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, helping his team manage a 110-107 win in overtime.</p>
<p>But it was a costly night for San Antonio in Game 5. Already seeing future Hall-of-Fame point guard Tony Parker lost for the year with an injury, the Spurs lost Kawhi Leonard to an injury as well. That’s why the team had to limp their way to a narrow win to take a three-to-two game lead in the best of seven series.</p>
<p>Already, the pundits were writing off the Spurs. They predicted Ginobili’s block to be more of a “last gasp” for the proud franchise’s incredible run since Coach Greg Popovich took over. Other sportscasters noted that without Leonard for Game 6, and possibly Game 7, Houston was the favorite to win the series, and would provide the more intriguing matchup with the Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>Houston looked like they read too many of their headlines proclaiming themselves the favorite. And without Parker and Leonard, why not? What would they have to prepare for?</p>
<p>But that’s because they underestimated Greg Popovich, the talented but inconsistent LaMarcus Aldrdige, Pau Gasol, Jonathon Simmons, the ageless Manu Ginobili, Patty Mills and rookie guard Dejounte Murray. All are underrated, but they turned in an incredible performance. The team led by more than 20 points going into halftime, and kept their foot on the gas pedal the whole game in the 114-75 blowout. The Rockets looked more like SCUD Missile duds. Coach Mike D’Antoni looked as confused as his players by the Spurs outburst, led by Aldridge, who turned in a career game.</p>
<p>Yet sadly, the Spurs may have lost their team leader, Kawhi Leonard, the MVP trophy. A top-notch defender, good scorer, and winner of the 2014 NBA Finals MVP, Leonard was considered a top 4 candidate (even the best candidate by many), along with Harden, LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Stephen Curry of the Warriors. But just as the Spurs showed that Harden wasn’t one of league’s best, they also proved they could win without Leonard. Now it’s a battle between James and Curry.</p>
<p>However, the Spurs have put Leonard in a chance to win another NBA Finals MVP. If he can return from the injury, and his teammates play this well, it will be the Spurs hoisting the finals trophy for 2017, instead of the Warriors, Cavs or Boston Celtics.</p>

<p>The sheer brilliance of Golden State’s offense is undeniable. No team recorded a better offensive efficiency rating, scored more points or dominated the fast-break more than the Warriors all year. When you have a quartet like Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson, it certainly makes sense.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Golden State’s defensive excellence has been well-documented, but is perhaps not fully understood. How the team goes about it is just as impressive. The Warriors don’t simply guard teams ― they overwhelm them; suffocate them, even. </p>
<p>To hamstring an NBA opponent is a tall task. It requires all five players’ commitment. It also requires versatility, and that’s where the Dubs separate themselves. How many guys can switch ball screens? How many wing players can guard the low post? How many can protect the rim? Interchangeable pieces and versatility are crucial.</p>
<p>In the Warriors’ first-round series against the Portland Trail Blazers, we saw Head Coach Steve Kerr employ a hybrid lineup. Remember the so-called “death lineup” last year? With Durant’s rare 1-through-5 defensive ability, this is a modified version of that, only even more effective.</p>
<p>Green, Thompson, Andre Iguodala, Ian Clark and David West blitzed Portland, coaxing the Blazers into a 1-12 stretch with four turnovers to start the fourth quarter. What had been a close, hard-fought battle turned into a double-digit victory.</p>
<p>This happened once again in Golden State’s Game 1 victory over the Utah Jazz. The quintet started the fourth and blitzed the Jazz with a 10-0 run that essentially sealed the game ― a game in which the Dubs connected on just 24 percent of their threes. </p>
<p>Through their eight games this postseason ― all wins ― the Warriors have amassed a postseason best 96.9 defensive rating that’s nearly four points better than any other team’s. They have also outscored opponents by 16.5 points per game, one of the best marks ever compiled.</p>
<p>Interim Head Coach Mike Brown, who is filling in for the injured Kerr, keeps a simple approach: “Defensively, let’s be locked in and try to limit the mistakes,” he said after his club’s 121-95 victory in Game 4 to close out the Jazz.</p>
<p>Green is the linchpin of it all. The 27-year-old ― who will soon earn his third straight First-Team All-NBA Defense selection ― isn’t so much a stopper as he is a finely tuned Swiss army knife. He blocks shots, drives point guards insane, and as always, sets the tone as only he can.</p>
<p>“Draymond was amazing,” Kerr said after a 121-109 Game 1 win over the Blazers. “He made some tremendous defensive plays. He made threes. He rebounded the ball. He had nine assists. He played a game that I’m not sure anyone else in the league is capable [of], honestly. He’s so unique, and so important to us. He’s phenomenal.”</p>
<p>Green’s unique ability was once again on display during Game 1 of a second-round series versus the Jazz. Not only did he check All-Star wing Gordon Hayward; he also guarded the red-hot Joe Johnson and even 7-foot-1-inch center Rudy Gobert. Hayward and Johnson ― the team’s top two offensive threats in the playoffs ― combined for a measly 23 points on 8-25 shooting in the loss.</p>
<p>With Green as dominant defensively as he’s ever been, the real boon to the Warriors has been Durant. He’s not only one of the truly great scorers in league history, but also one of today’s most versatile defensive weapons. At 7 feet tall, he's a legitimate rim protector even though he’s often guarding wings. His length and dexterity allow him to cover different types of players.</p>
<p>This year, he averaged a career-best 1.6 blocks per game while holding opponents to 44.8 percent shooting, per NBA.com. Additionally, he ranked sixth in the league in defensive win shares (Green was first), ahead of known lockdown defenders like Kawhi Leonard, Jimmy Butler and Andre Roberson.</p>
<p>“Very unusual defensive player,” Ron Adams ― the Warriors’ defensive guru ― told The Mercury News in February. “He’s a great helper, very good at making passes difficult. ... He’s added a lot to our defensive scheme.”</p>

<p>U.S. bobsledder Steven Holcomb, who came back from a suicide attempt over impending blindness to win Olympic gold in 2010, was found dead at a training site on Saturday, the U.S. Olympic Committee said.</p>
<p>Holcomb, 37, was discovered in his room at the U.S. Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid, New York, the committee said in a statement. It gave no further details.</p>
<p>Holcomb, who underwent successful surgery in 2008 to overcome a degenerative eye disease, made history at the Vancouver Olympics when he piloted the U.S. four-man bobsled team, nicknamed “Night Train,” to the gold medal.</p>
<p>It marked the first U.S. gold medal in the event since 1948 and the three-time Olympian’s comeback from depression over increasing blindness, according to his biography on the Team USA website.</p>
<p>Holcomb took bronze medals in both two-man and four-man bobsled at the 2014 Sochi Games. He also won five world titles among his 10 world championship medals and was a six-time overall world cup champion, winning 60 world cup medals.</p>
<p>The New York State Police, which is handling the case, had no immediate comment on Holcomb’s death.</p>
<p>“The entire Olympic family is shocked and saddened by the incredibly tragic loss today of Steven Holcomb,” U.S. Olympic Committee Chief Executive Scott Blackmun said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve’s family and the entire bobsledding community.”</p>
<p>Holcomb’s autobiography, But Now I See: My Journey from Blindness to Olympic Gold, had outlined how people suffering from depression should seek treatment, the Team USA profile said.</p>
<p>“USA Bobsled & Skeleton is a family and right now we are trying to come to grips with the loss of our teammate, our brother and our friend,” said USA Bobsled & Skeleton Chief Executive Darrin Steele.</p>

<p>(Reuters) - Swimming legend Adolph Kiefer, who had been the oldest living U.S. Olympic gold medalist in any sport, died on Friday at his home in Illinois at age 98, the International Swimming Hall of Fame said.</p>
<p>Kiefer won the 100-meter backstroke at the 1936 Berlin Olympics as a 17 year old in an Olympic record time that stood for 20 years.</p>
<p>“Adolph Kiefer embodied swimming and lived it every day of his life. He was a pioneer for our sport in the truest sense of the word,” USA Swimming Interim Executive Director Mike Unger said in a statement.</p>
<p>Kiefer later was an instructor in the U.S. Navy and a business owner whose swimming products helped advance the sport.</p>
<p>The first man to break one minute in the 100-yard backstroke as a high schooler in Illinois, Kiefer was inducted into the inaugural class of the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1965, and served on the President’s Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition under three U.S. presidents.</p>

<p>No other athlete has experienced or might ever experience the pressures that Serena Williams has sustained to achieve greatness in an individual sport. As a child, the expectations for this superior athlete and future hall-of-famer were already established by her father (Richard Williams). In the late 90s, Mr. Williams proclaimed that Venus (her legendary, older sister) was good, but Serena would be much better. Even if these future projections weren’t known by Serena, the professional tennis community collectively took notice and some were bothered by his comments.</p>
<p>As a professional athlete, Serena (who followed Venus’ debut on the women’s professional tennis tour) was compared to her empowering sister. Would she be as good; could she be better; what would she accomplish?!</p>
<p>Serena isn’t known for being silent or demure on the tennis court. Notwithstanding, she proved her mettle and quickly silenced her critics’ doubts with her athleticism, skill, and will power to become arguably (not really) the greatest athlete of all time. No other athlete (man or woman) has dominated a sport in terms of her reign of weeks at #1, personal challenges/setbacks overcome, tennis achievements, sports dominance, and championships earned.</p>
<p>Numerous mothers-to-be deal with the sometimes-paralyzing challenges of pregnancy during their first trimesters. This makes it even more incredible that Serena is estimated to have been two months pregnant at the time she won the Australian Open. In some ways, this is a little unfair and against the rules of tennis singles play since it was sort of two people competing against one. Nevertheless, with this 23rd grand slam title, Serena “cemented her legacy” as the Greatest of All Time (GOAT).</p>
<p>In April 2017, fans around the world were excited by the unexpected news about her pregnancy. However, there were probably numerous female players who felt relief that she wouldn’t be vying for another grand slam title ―- at least this year. Serena – who recently reclaimed the #1 title and extended her dominance on this sport – would now be away from the game for at least a year. This sudden void causes uncertainty and speculations about who will emerge as the dominate force during her absence, along with questions about whether she’ll return to the game and regain her domination.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the following should be considered:</p>
<p> Will this legendary champion return to this game this late in her career; Will she be able to regain her form after delivering her child; Will she end her tennis career with a climatic ending by becoming the winningest player (male of female) during the open area ―- and while pregnant; Is this yet another fairy tale absence and reemergence to dominant the tour yet again? </p>
<p>This preeminent athlete is known for her ability to multi-task, desire to overcome challenges, and ability to command herself to win. Therefore, it’s my prediction that Serena will not retire and will return to the game in time to win her 24th championship at the Australian Open in 2018. Moreover, she’ll impose her will to win at least three more singles championships before her career ends.</p>
<p>Serena’s ferocious pursuit of greatness, enormous talent, competitive drive, and fearlessness will certainly be missed during her journey into motherhood ―- and some day (long, long away) after she retires from professional tennis.</p>
<p>Regardless of Serena’s future plans, we’re blessed to be a witness to her tennis reign; although, it’s my hope for her fans and myself that she’ll return to this game to compete for many years to come!</p>

<p>Former NBA star Brandon Roy risked his own life to save those of the children around him during a shooting in the Los Angeles area over the weekend, someone with knowledge of the situation has told USA Today’s Sam Amick. </p>
<p>Roy, 32, was outside his grandmother’s home when someone began shooting. Roy, a bystander, was reportedly shot in the leg while shielding the children around him.</p>
<p>Roy is expected to make a full recovery and is already back in Washington state, where he coaches the Nathan Hale High School basketball team.</p>
<p>In reaction to the news, the Portland Trail Blazers, the team with which Roy made his name in the NBA, issued a statement of support for their former star. </p>
<p>“Like many others, we’re just learning of the injury suffered by former Trail Blazers player Brandon Roy in a shooting over the weekend in California,” the team said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with Brandon and his family during this time.”</p>
<p>Roy had a short but spectacular career in the NBA. Three times in his first four seasons, he was selected to the All-Star team. However, he was dogged by knee problems that eventually forced him into retirement in 2012. </p>

<p>WASHINGTON — A day after fans at Fenway Park yelled racial slurs and threw peanuts at Baltimore Orioles center fielder Adam Jones, Boston right fielder Mookie Betts called on the Red Sox community to “literally stand up” for Jones and “say no to racism.” </p>
<p>Many listened. </p>
<p>As Jones walked up to bat in the top of the first inning Tuesday, fans at Fenway rose to their feet and cheered the opposing player — a rare sight inside any Major League Baseball park. </p>
<p>After Monday’s game, Jones described the “pathetic” treatment he was subjected to on the field. </p>
<p>“A disrespectful person threw a bag of peanuts at me and I got called the ‘N’-word a handful of times,” Jones said after the Orioles’ 5-2 win, The Boston Globe reported. “It was pretty awesome out there. Just part of the job, right? That’s one of the worst nights. It’s very unfortunate, to be honest with you.”</p>
<p>The incident received national media attention. On Tuesday, Red Sox President Sam Kennedy issued a formal apology, and MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred Jr. issued a statement saying that such actions will not be tolerated and that “the behavior of these few ignorant individuals does not reflect the millions of great baseball fans who attend our games.” </p>
<p>Betts took to Twitter later Tuesday to encourage Red Sox fans to stand up for Jones. </p>
<p>“We as @RedSox and @MLB fans are better than this,” Betts wrote. </p>
<p>During the first inning of Tuesday’s game, Kennedy spoke to the incident on Boston Red Sox Radio Network WEEI. He said he wanted the fans’ partnership in identifying people who are acting inappropriately at games and that he was proud to see the Fenway crowd cheer on Jones after what played out the night before. </p>
<p>“That’s who we are as a fan base, and that was so great to see,” he said.</p>
<p>“You know, that’s the sad and disappointing thing about when these things happen,” Kennedy added. “One person can say something despicable or offensive, and unfortunately it casts a negative light on an entire region. ... That’s why we have to work so diligently together to try and make sure people know that that won’t be tolerated, there are consequences to be paid for such actions.” </p>
<p>CORRECTION: The subheadline in an earlier version of this story misstated the name of Orioles player Adam Jones as Alex Jones.</p>

<p>Earning an invitation to the McDonald’s High School All-American game is like earning All-NBA honors as a professional: not just an All-Star appearance, but the pinnacle of the sport.</p>
<p>Not only were Atlanta’s Wendell Carter Jr. and Salem, Oregon’s Evina Westbrook selected to the game, but they’ve also been chosen as the 2017 Morgan Wootten Players of the Year. The award ― previously handed out to the likes of LeBron James, Jahlil Okafor, Jabari Parker and Maya Moore ― recognizes them for their outstanding character, leadership and the values as student-athletes in the community. </p>
<p>Carter, who is committed to Duke, and Westbrook, a Tennessee signee, recently caught up with HuffPost to discuss the prestigious McDonald’s game, as well their emphasis on academia and how the love of all things basketball extends far beyond the game.</p>
<p>The recruiting process can be relentless. What was the hardest part about it for you? </p>
<p>Wendell Carter Jr.: Saying no to some of the great schools. Harvard, Georgia, Georgia Tech and Duke were all great schools and unfortunately, I can only go to one of the schools, so saying no was probably the hardest part.</p>
<p>Did you enjoy your recruitment?</p>
<p>Evina Westbrook: Oh, I definitely had the most enjoyment in my recruitment. I think me and my parents handled it very well and it was really in our control. We didn’t let it overwhelm us or anything like that. We were in control at all times and we managed when I would talk to coaches on the phone and when they would talk to coaches on the phone. </p>
<p>How did you manage the high demand, especially with the barrage of phone calls from coaches? </p>
<p>EW: I would just let them know, “Hey coach, I’m busy right now but is there a time where I can call you tomorrow or maybe in the next couple of days?” So when I was busy or I was hanging out with my family or had to do homework ― anything like that ― I definitely let them know that I’m not forgetting about them. I’m just busy at the moment just like any other teenager. You just have to really communicate.</p>
<p>What drew you to Tennessee aside from the wonderful hoops tradition? </p>
<p>EW: I think when I was on my visit, that was just a place where I felt most at home. I’ve always wanted to go away from home ― I’ve known that since I was younger, and my parents have known that. I feel like I’m going to be safe and surrounded by people who have my best interests. </p>
<p>Duke is a highly respected university, aside from all its basketball prowess. What attracted you to the school?</p>
<p>WC: Like you said, it had a great measure of both academics and athletics. I’m not saying that Harvard was not a great athletic school and I’m not taking away from any other colleges ― it just seemed like Duke was the perfect mix of both. And the town is nice and small, not too busy, and also still a college town where I think I can have a little bit of fun.</p>
<p>How did you inform other coaches that you would be attending Duke? </p>
<p>WC: I kind of let them find out after my commitment video because it was kind of hard to call them over the phone. If I could, I would rather talk to them face to face and tell them, but I wasn’t able to do that.</p>
<p>Your family recently hosted Coach K in your home as part of a recruiting visit. What was that like? </p>
<p>WC: It felt great. Being able to talk to him, listen to all the knowledge he was able to give to me at the moment. It just felt amazing, him and all the assistant coaches just sitting in the same dining room that I sit in every day — it felt amazing.</p>
<p>What did you enjoy about the relentless AAU circuit? </p>
<p>WC: You get more of a chance to prove yourself to the college coaches who are at these games. Every game was a great game, every team had great players on the team so there were never any blowouts or anything like that. It gave you an opportunity to show coaches that you’re an actual hooper and you know what it means to play basketball.</p>
<p>What role did academics play during such a strenuous hoops schedule?</p>
<p>WC: Growing up, my parents told me that if I didn’t maintain an A in all of my classes I wasn’t allowed to play basketball in my church league or go out and play basketball. So it kind of was engrained in my brain if I don’t keep good grades in the classroom I was not going to be able to play basketball. I eventually started liking school and actually going to class. I mean, it took me a while to actually like it, I’d wake myself up in the morning to go to school and it kind of took off on its own.</p>
<p>EW: My main thing was that if I didn’t get good grades, I couldn’t play. So if I wanted to keep playing or keep working out or keep going to the gym after school, my grades had to be all As and Bs. So for me, there was really no other way.</p>
<p>Did you grow up watching both the men’s and women’s game?</p>
<p>EW: Yes, both. It’s just something that I’ve had dreams of being a part of and it’s amazing to say that I can be a part of something like this.</p>
<p>Basketball IQ is a term we hear describing you. When did you develop it?</p>
<p>EW: I started playing in fourth grade, but I always played with boys so I think that had a lot to do with it. I never really started playing with girls until the eighth grade. Just playing with my guys where I worked out at and really just putting in the time and just wanting to get better is something I loved. </p>
<p>Did playing with guys help you increase the physical element and your overall approach to basketball?</p>
<p>EW: I mean yeah, a little bit. Guys are obviously a little more physical and they’re bigger and stronger than a lot of girls. The hits didn’t really affect me that much ― the game is a little bit different. It’s really helped me now.</p>
<p>What type of advice have you received from NBA players?</p>
<p>WC: I’ve been able to talk to Chris Paul. I’ve talked to Blake Griffin once, I’ve talked to Jabari Parker once. I was able to talk to Jahlil Okafor and that’s about it. </p>
<p>How do you balance basketball with living a regular teenage life?</p>
<p>WC: I kind of make time for it. Just like I made time for basketball, I made time for my friends and family, I kind of let it work itself out. I don’t try to strain myself in the gym, I believe that God has a plan for me and he’ll tell me how long I’ll have to be in the gym, when I need to be with my family and friends and that’s kind of how I approach it. I think I can call myself a people person.</p>
<p>What level of importance do you put on being coachable and a good teammate?</p>
<p>WC: Yeah, that was one thing I’ve always wanted to work on. Growing up I’ve been known as the kid with the bad temper ― getting mad at refs and my teammates and things like that. And I just got tired of hearing that so I found a way to fix myself where I’m more coachable. Enjoying the game, and enjoying the moment, that’s really about it. </p>
<p>NBA players stress the summer as the time to add to their games. What part of your game will you attack this summer? </p>
<p>WC: My endurance and stamina is definitely one thing I want to improve, where I’m able to play in the game longer and still be able to play as hard as I did from tip-off. I also want to work on my ball-handling skills and my confidence ― like if time is running down and we need a big shot, I can be able to do it and still be calm and collected and still make the right moves to get the ball off.</p>

<p>The NFL draft is back on ESPN with blanket (read: suffocating) coverage, which always makes me think: What if Americans cared about their wars as much as they cared about the NFL? What if decisions were fact-based and results-oriented? What if everyone was well-informed, highly motivated, and committed to excellence? What if the media provided honest, often outspoken, and comprehensive commentary about our wars, coverage that lasted for months and months, featuring clear-eyed metrics based on relentless analysis? I know ― dream on.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with NFL football or ESPN coverage of the same, you should be, because it says much about the American moment. The first round of the draft kicks off on Thursday night in prime time, followed by the second and third rounds on Friday night in prime time. The draft concludes on Saturday with rounds four through seven, roughly 250 total picks.</p>
<p>Yet this quick summary vastly understates the coverage devoted to the draft. From the end of the Super Bowl early in February to the draft itself at the end of April, coverage of the draft on ESPN is virtually non-stop, with innumerable “mock” drafts for each team and a parade of “experts” speculating about the prospects of each player and team. Exhaustive (and exhausting) is the word to describe this coverage.</p>
<p>When Round One finally kicks off, it’s essentially a parade of soon-to-be millionaires. These players, selected from various college football teams, can count on multi-year contracts and signing bonuses in the millions of dollars. ESPN and the NFL stage-manages the selection process, turning it into an extravaganza complete with musicians, cheering (or booing) fans, and plenty of past NFL greats, along with the draftees and their families and friends. Coverage includes shots of the “war rooms” of the various NFL teams as they decide which players to pick, which draft picks to trade, and so on.</p>
<p>The war room — isn’t that a telling phrase?</p>
<p>Indeed, let’s push that further. Most red-blooded NFL fans would be hard-pressed to find Iraq or Afghanistan on a map, but they can tell you about their team’s draft picks, rattling off statistics such as times in the 40-yard dash, vertical leap, even the size of a player’s hands (considered especially pertinent if he’s a quarterback or wide receiver). What astonishes me is the sheer wealth of detail gathered about each player, the human intelligence (or HUMINT in military terms). Players, especially those projected to go in the first few rounds, are scrutinized from every angle: physical, mental, emotional, you name it.</p>
<p>With millions of dollars at stake, such an exhaustive approach is not terribly surprising. Yet even with a wealth of data, each year there are major draft busts (e.g. Ryan Leaf, a quarterback selected #2 overall in the first round and a flop) and major surprises (e.g. Tom Brady, a quarterback selected late in the 6th round as the 199th pick, meaning not much was expected from him, after which he won five Super Bowls). Results from the NFL draft should teach us something about the limits of data-driven “intelligence” in wars, yet our nation’s intelligence agencies (17 of them!) continue to believe they can quantify, predict, and control events in places we and they know little about.</p>
<p>But again what wows me is the thoroughness as well as the slickness of ESPN’s coverage of the draft. When a player is selected, ESPN instantly has video of his college highlights, together with his vital statistics (height, weight, performance at the draft combine in various drills, and so on). Video and stats are backed by interviews with a draftee’s previous coaches, who extol his virtues, along with interviews with those “war rooms” again as to why they decided to draft that player and not another. Once the draft is completed, teams are then awarded “grades” by various commentators, even though these players have yet to play a snap in the NFL. (Imagine if your kid received an instant grade in college — before he attended a single class or completed a single assignment — based upon his performance in high school.)</p>
<p>You have to hand it to ESPN: their coverage of the draft is an exercise in total information awareness. It’s blanket coverage, an exercise in full-spectrum dominance. It’s slick, professional, and driven by a tireless pursuit of victory by each team (and a relentless pursuit of ratings by ESPN).</p>
<p>So, a modest proposal: To win the war on terror, let’s put ESPN in charge of it. I know: It’s a frivolous suggestion to treat war like a sport. But is it? After all, America currently treats the NFL draft with all the seriousness of a life-and-death struggle, even as it treats its wars with comparative frivolity. Small wonder America continues to lose its wars while fielding some winning NFL teams.</p>

<p>Maybe the question should have been rephrased from the get-go.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul took umbrage at a reporter who basically asked if his team could win its next playoff game against the Utah Jazz to force a Game 7 in their series.</p>
<p>Paul, already smarting from the Clippers’ loss at home to the Jazz to give Utah a 3 to 2 lead, went off on the guy in the postgame presser, For The Win reported.</p>
<p>It started when the reporter asked, “Will the Clippers be back here Sunday playing a Game 7?”</p>
<p>A sneering and dismissive Paul replied, “What you want me to say? No, it’s over?”</p>
<p>Check out the full exchange, posted by Sports Illustrated, below. And pro tip for journalists: Don’t ask athletes if they think they will win.</p>

<p>San Antonio Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich apparently left a $5,000 tip on a $815.73 bill last week at a restaurant close to the stadium of the team’s first-round playoffs opponent.</p>
<p>A receipt, which surfaced on Reddit on Tuesday, appeared to have been signed by a man with a very similar signature to the coach the night before his team’s Game 4 matchup against the Memphis Grizzlies.</p>
<p>The tip was left at McEwen’s on Monroe, an establishment that is just a 10-minute walk from the FedEx Forum, where the Spurs were set to play the Grizzlies.</p>
<p>The owner of McEwen’s, Bert Smithe, told mySA.com that “Coach Popovich has been in our restaurant in the past multiple times,” but would not discuss the particulars of his bill or when he last dined there.</p>
<p>“We don’t discuss anything that goes on when VIPs are in the building,” Smithe said. That said, he did then add that people had been discussing Popovich’s tip “in town,” whatever that means. </p>
<p>The coach, widely considered to be the best in the NBA, has been known to leave generous tips when he dines at restaurants. But $5,000 is quite a bit more than, say, $1,000.</p>
<p>Either way, the story fits perfectly in line with Popovich’s “good guy” image. Good on you, Gregg.</p>

<p>The organization that governs soccer in much of the Americas has slapped its former leaders with a $20 million lawsuit for fraud.</p>
<p>The Confederation of North, Central American, and Caribbean Association Football, or CONCACAF — which sends teams from that region to compete in the World Cup — named its former general secretary, Chuck Blazer, and its former president, Jack Warner, in a suit filed last week in the U.S. Eastern District of New York. The suit also names some of Blazer’s shell companies.</p>
<p>“There can be no doubt that Warner and Blazer victimized CONCACAF, stealing and defrauding it out of tens of millions of dollars in brazen acts of corruption for their own personal benefit,” the suit states. “The defendants sought to pillage CONCACAF from the inside, seeking endless ways to embezzle funds from the organization.”</p>
<p>The charges come in the wake of a major Department of Justice investigation into years of corruption in international soccer.</p>
<p>Blazer pleaded guilty in 2013 to racketeering, money laundering, wire fraud and tax evasion ― all linked to kickbacks he received in exchange for media rights and tournament marketing contracts, as well as bribes involving the 1998 and 2010 World Cups and several Gold Cup tournaments. </p>
<p>In 2015, Warner was named in a massive Justice Department indictment against members of the global soccer body FIFA, sports marketing executives and leaders of national soccer organizations. He is fighting extradition from Trinidad and Tobago to face U.S. charges of criminal racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering, among other offenses.</p>
<p>The CONCACAF lawsuit says it aims to recoup the bribes and the “millions of dollars in commissions and fees through marketing and broadcast deals that CONCACAF’s executive committee did not authorize.”</p>
<p>After becoming general secretary in 1990, Blazer moved CONCACAF’s headquarters from the Caribbean to the 11th floor of Trump Tower in New York City until he was ejected from his post in 2011 as officials became suspicious of his activities. He also lived in Trump Tower at the time, and allegedly added an adjoining apartment there for his cats. </p>
<p>Once the FBI and IRS nabbed Blazer in 2011, he agreed to cooperate with the feds as part of his plea negotiations. Intelligence agencies tapped phone calls to Blazer’s home to glean information for later criminal indictments related to corruption in international soccer.</p>
<p>The recent CONCACAF lawsuit accuses Blazer of using the organization’s funds to cover his Trump Tower rent and to buy two condos in Miami Beach and another in the Bahamas. Such funds were “intended for the development programs for football, not to support Blazer’s luxurious personal lifestyle,” the suit states.</p>
<p>Warner “aided and abetted” Blazer’s schemes, according to the lawsuit. Blazer has admitted in court that he “and others” agreed to accept a $10 million bribe for voting in favor of holding the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. At the time, both men were on FIFA’s executive committee, which determined where future World Cups would be held.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether Warner will ever be brought to the U.S. to face charges. In 2015, he recaptured media attention when he took out a Trinidadian television ad to denounce John Oliver’s “Last Week Tonight” segment about him, mistaking it for a serious news program (and giving Oliver even more fodder).</p>
<p>Blazer, who is reportedly now in hospice care, agreed to forfeit at least $2 million as part of his guilty plea and still faces additional penalties. His testimony or recordings of his wiretapped conversations could be part of future trials involving former soccer and sports marketing officials.</p>
<p>Neither Blazer nor Warner could be reached for comment. </p>

<p>MEMPHIS, Tenn. ― Kawhi Leonard was making everything, scoring San Antonio’s last 16 points in the fourth quarter and finishing with a career-high 43 points.</p>
<p>The Spurs’ young star hit 7 of 10 shots from 3-point range, made one-legged, fade-away jumpers and put his team on his back while scoring eight of their 12 points in overtime.</p>
<p>It still wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>In the end, it was Marc Gasol’s floating jumper over LaMarcus Aldridge with 0.7 seconds left in overtime that gave the Memphis Grizzlies a 110-108 victory over the Spurs on Saturday night at FedExForum to even their first-round Western Conference playoff series at 2-2.</p>
<p>“(Gasol) made the play that mattered,” said Mike Conley, who led Memphis with a postseason franchise record 35 points and had nine rebounds and eight assists. “It’s scary as hell watching (Leonard). He was unbelievable.”</p>
<p>Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said the same of the game.</p>
<p>“Both teams played their hearts out,” he said. “Just a fantastic basketball game. The fans got their money’s worth. Marc made a great shot. L.A. (Aldridge) contested it very well; it (went) down.”</p>
<p>But one key shot right at the rim did not go down. With 1:36 left in overtime and the Spurs up 102-100, Spurs guard Tony Parker stole a pass from Conley and had a fastbreak with Patty Mills. But as Mills went in for what looked like a sure layup and a four-point lead, Grizzlies rookie guard Andrew Harrison blocked him from behind.</p>
<p>That started a fastbreak the other way that ended with a Gasol layup, a foul by David Lee, and a Gasol free throw for a 103-102 Memphis lead.</p>
<p>“That was the play of the game, other than Marc’s,” Conley said. “For a young guy to make a play like that, that’s a five-point swing. We gave it up for him in the locker room, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>Said Harrison, who also had seven points and three rebounds: “I just didn’t want to give up on the play. I thought I had a chance to hit the ball and I did.”</p>
<p>Leonard added eight rebounds, six steals and three assists to his stat line and his fade-away jumper with 12 seconds left in regulation gave San Antonio a 96-94 lead.</p>
<p>But Conley, who had 11 points in the fourth, answered with a floater in the lane with 4.5 seconds left to tie the game at 96. Leonard then missed a contested 21-footer at the buzzer to send the game into overtime.</p>
<p>It was a rare miss in the fourth quarter and overtime, where Leonard was 8-for-13 from the floor and 5-for-6 from distance.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I’m taking suggestions on how to guard Kawhi Leonard,” Memphis coach David Fizdale said. “I’ve tried everything and the guy is just tough. Man, is he a superstar.”</p>
<p>The Grizzlies overcame 23 turnovers that translated into 31 San Antonio points.</p>
<p>“You just got to keep playing,” said Grizzlies forward Zach Randolph, who had 12 points and 11 rebounds. “You got to go on to the next play, and the next play after that.”</p>
<p>Gasol finished with 16 points, 12 rebounds and four assists; he also committed seven turnovers. JaMychal Green had 14 points off the bench.</p>
<p>Parker had 22 points and five assists for San Antonio. Aldridge scored 13 points.</p>
<p>The Spurs shot 42.3 percent from the floor and went 9-for-30 from 3-point range (30 percent). Memphis shot 46.3 percent from the field while going 12-for-27 from distance (44.4 percent).</p>
<p>The Spurs had a 10-point lead in the first quarter and an opportunity to take away the Grizzlies’ hope. But passing that first test set Memphis up for all the others that would follow.</p>
<p>“I learned a long time ago if you don’t have mental stability when they punch you in the mouth, you’re in the wrong business,” Fizdale said.</p>
<p>“I thought we played well enough to win the game,” Parker said, and then looking ahead to Game 5 in San Antonio: “It’s a must-win situation for us now.”</p>
<p>Conley says the Grizzlies view Game 5 the same way.</p>
<p>“Of course, we’re in desperation mode,” he said. “According to the media, we were supposed to be swept anyway.”</p>
<p>NOTES: The Grizzlies’ Game 3 victory on Thursday night snapped the Spurs’ 10-game postseason winning streak over Memphis. The Grizzlies had not defeated the Spurs since Game 6 of their first-round series in 2011 when Memphis became just the second No. 8 seed in NBA history to eliminate a No. 1 seed. ... Spurs C Dewayne Dedmon missed Game 4 with an illness. David Lee started in his place. ... Memphis SG Vince Carter (13 points) became the first 40-year-old to make at least three triples in a playoff game, going 3-for-5 from long range.</p>

<p>The top-seeded Boston Celtics find themselves in a precarious position. It’s down two games to zero against a Chicago team that barely made the NBA Playoffs and seemingly almost fired its coach multiple times, and the blame for Boston’s woes has predictably shifted onto its boy-wonder coach, Brad Stevens.</p>
<p>Stevens, 40, has dropped 12 of 14 games, accumulating the worst career postseason record of all time. It’s a convenient statistic for those pointing the finger his way. But the sentiment is unfair. </p>
<p>To understand why we must recognize that the Celtics at their core have a flawed roster, and one that has easily been exposed. For example, despite winning 53 games this season, they still lack a true center. Al Horford is a fine player, but he’s also a power forward masquerading as a five man. He has been abused by Chicago’s 7-footer Robin Lopez, who right now is collecting one out of every five Bulls misses ― a clip that easily would have led the league during the regular season. The Bulls have also dominated the glass thus far, out-rebounding Boston by a margin of 23.</p>
<p>Then there’s Boston’s helplessness in protecting the rim, which has allowed Chicago’s perimeter players to live in the paint. Neither Horford, Amir Johnson, Kelly Olynyk or Tyler Zeller are legitimate shot-blocking threats. As a result, Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade have attacked relentlessly, enjoying a barrage of free passes in the lane.</p>
<p>In one of their better combined performances of the season, the duo each scored 22 points in a 111-97 Game 2 win. The performance showed us the importance of having wings who can “get theirs” in the playoffs.</p>
<p>Boston’s most glaring deficiency, however, stems from its best player. Isaiah Thomas, for all his offensive prowess, has been put in the blender by Bulls point guard Rajon Rondo, who has turned back the clock to his Celtic days, when he earned four consecutive All-Star appearances.</p>
<p>Thomas, understandably, is not his normal self right now, after the unexpected death of his sister. But then again, the 31-year-old Rondo ― who scored 11 points and dished out 14 assists, while amassing 9 rebounds and 5 steals in Game 2 ― is simply doing to him what others have done all season. It’s unclear how things will play out now that Rondo has been declared out indefinitely with a broken thumb, but Thomas isn’t exactly primed for a defensive turnaround.</p>
<p>According to ESPN’s Defensive Real Plus Minus, the 5-foot-9 Thomas ranked dead last this season for all point guards. So perhaps it’s no surprise that Rondo completely dictated his tempo to Thomas. In Game 2, for example, the Bulls shot 58 percent when the shot was created by Rondo, but just 47 percent on all other attempts, per ESPN Stats & Info.</p>
<p>As one NBA head coach told me recently of Thomas: “He just can’t defend. Probably the worst we’ve seen all year as far as point guards go.”</p>
<p>Thomas’ sheer inability to guard his position puts Stevens in a precarious spot. He can’t bench him, because Thomas is the main source of offense. He couldn’t put Avery Bradley on Rondo, because it would free up Butler ― and Rondo’s absence doesn’t change anything because Thomas can still only guard one position. Jae Crowder is a good player but he doesn’t have the foot speed to check Butler or Wade, and Marcus Smart can’t play extended minutes because he’s so bad offensively. Finally, there is the talented but green rookie Jaylen Brown, who is lightyears away from being trusted on this stage.</p>
<p>Naturally, when general manager Danny Ainge was asked about the criticism of Stevens, he deflected the blame.</p>
<p>”I think anything is fair,” Ainge said following Game 2. “I don’t agree with them, but I haven’t written this series off yet either. I don’t even want to go there. I think that anything is fair. Sure. Any criticism is fair.”</p>
<p>The only “fair” criticism right now should be aimed at Ainge, who has been the architect of the entire roster. Don’t forget that he is sitting on gold right now ― a pick-swap with the Brooklyn Nets in June’s draft, plus the Nets’ 2018 first-round selection. Remember the swirling rumors of Butler and Indiana’s Paul George both being on the trading block?</p>
<p>Not making a deal wasn’t only foolish, it was pure negligence. The opportunity to land a top 10 player in his prime doesn’t come along often ― and when two were being shopped, Ainge is the one at fault for not doing whatever it took to make it happen.</p>
<p>Regardless of what happens the rest of this series, Brad Stevens has surely done his part. The former Butler University coach resurrected a moribund franchise to improved win totals during all four seasons at the helm: 25 in his first year, then 40, 48 and 53. Regardless of what happens now, that shouldn’t be forgotten.</p>

<p>The New England Patriots visited the White House on Wednesday to celebrate their Super Bowl win alongside President Donald Trump, an annual tradition for the winner of the NFL championship. Well, half of the Patriots did, anyway.</p>
<p>Thirty-four Patriots players, plus several staff members and coach Bill Belichick, attended the ceremony on the White House lawn as Trump praised what he called “the greatest Super Bowl comeback of all time.” The team’s full roster includes 68 players, which means half of the squad skipped the celebration.</p>
<p>Super Bowl champion players often miss the annual White House victory visit due to scheduling conflicts. But turnout for Wednesday’s event appeared to be lower than for a previous Patriots visit in 2015. To some players, absences were notably linked to politics.</p>
<p>The New York Times first pointed out the stark difference between photographs of the event this year, and those from 2015, the last time the Patriots won the Super Bowl. The earlier photo shows about 120 people, including players and staff, standing behind former President Barack Obama. On Wednesday, there were barely more than 50 people alongside Trump.</p>
<p>The Patriots strongly refuted a Times tweet showing the 2015 and 2017 photographs, saying the comparisons “lack context.” The 2015 photo included more than 40 support staff members, who were seated on the lawn this year, the team said.</p>
<p>”Only during the Trump presidency does the media care ... this much about who doesn’t attend,” Patriots spokesman Stacey James told HuffPost.</p>
<p>On Thursday, New York Times’ sports editor Jason Stallman apologized for the paper’s tweet, which he called “terrible.”</p>
<p>“I wish I could say it’s complicated, but no, this one is pretty straightforward: I’m an idiot,” Stallman said in an email to The Washington Post. “It was my idea, it was my execution, it was my blunder. I made a decision in about four minutes that clearly warranted much more time.</p>
<p>“Once we learned more, we tried to fix everything as much as possible as swiftly as possible and as transparently as possible. Of course, at that point the damage was done. I just needed to own it.”</p>
<p>Wednesday was the fifth time the team has gone to the White House, James said, and the number of players attending has ranged from about 27 to 50.</p>
<p>“Here’s what gripes me ― the scrutiny with which the visit to the White House has been handled by the press,” James said. “Never before have we had players being asked, ‘Are you going to the White House?’ ... There were only a few players who came out who said they don’t support the president and weren’t going for that reason.”</p>
<p>Notably absent Wednesday was Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who canceled at the last minute, citing “personal family matters,” according to a statement obtained by ESPN. Brady also missed the festivities in 2015, but attended the three previous visits.</p>
<p>Trump didn’t mention Brady, but he did call out several players by name, including an awkward moment involving wide receiver Danny Amendola, The Boston Globe reported. Amendola was among those who missed the event.</p>
<p>“Where’s Danny? Where’s Danny?” Trump said. Amendola later thanked the president for the “shout out” in a since-deleted tweet, and said he was attending a funeral. </p>
<p>Six other Patriots had announced they wouldn’t attend the event for political reasons. The Globe reported this week that Alan Branch would skip the ceremony because of Trump’s sexist remarks, and “wouldn’t want to spend time away from my family to shake the hand of a guy I wouldn’t want to meet with or talk to.” Defensive back Devin McCourty told Time in February he would stay away, explaining the “basic reason for me is I don’t feel accepted in the White House.”</p>
<p>Trump has personal ties to the Patriots, as various media outlets have reported. Brady had a Make America Great Again hat in his locker for much of the 2016 season, and Trump’s campaign garnered the support of both Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft.</p>
<p>Trump responded to the controversy on Thursday with a jab at the Times. </p>
<p>Kraft in February complained about media attention to players’ decisions to skip this year’s celebration, saying it was the first time people cared.</p>
<p>“Every time we’ve had the privilege of going to the White House, a dozen of our players don’t go,” Kraft told the “Today” show. “This is the first time it’s gotten any media attention. You know, some of the players have the privilege of going in college because they’re on national championship teams, others have family commitments. But this is America. We’re all free to do whatever’s best for us. We’re just privileged to be in a position to be going.”</p>

<p>Thirty years after he sued the NFL, President Donald Trump stood on the White House lawn Wednesday and praised the New England Patriots for their incredible Super Bowl comeback.</p>
<p>Trump has been a big supporter of the Patriots and owner Robert Kraft, but has given little love to the league or the sport at all in recent years. Last year, he called football “soft” for a changed concussion policy to protect players from lasting brain damage. Trump also ripped apart NFL Commissioner Robert Goodell in February, calling him a “dope.”</p>
<p>Maybe the president is still a little resentful of the league that destroyed his chance at being a football owner.</p>
<p>Trump bought the New Jersey Generals in 1983, a team that was part of the failed United States Football League. He came in as an owner during the second season, just as the league was beginning to lose money and fans.</p>
<p>The USFL, which was founded amid a 1982 NFL lockout, played its games in the spring and aimed to be more fun and less strict than the NFL. But game ratings dropped almost immediately following its first season, after NFL games returned. If the USFL wanted to move from spring to fall in order to try for better ratings, it would have to challenge the NFL head-on for television rights. So Trump led the league’s ownership into a fatal lawsuit.</p>
<p>“[He was] the best thing that ever happened to the USFL, and two years later he was the worst thing that ever happened to the USFL,” Charley Steiner, former Generals radio personality, told Esquire. </p>
<p>Trump led the owners to sue the competition in a $1.7 billion dollar antitrust lawsuit that eventually bankrupted the entire league, which had already lost $200 million in its first year.</p>
<p>The jury did agree that the NFL held a monopoly over the television market for football, but the courts didn’t support claims that the USFL’s only issue was the monopoly. </p>
<p>So the USFL was awarded just $3 in damages, bankrupting the ownership group while the NFL moved on. </p>
<p>“It all happened in a flash,” Steiner told Esquire. “Then the USFL was dead and gone and he moved on to the next thing, which was Atlantic City. Which didn’t work out too well, either.”</p>
<p>Most people blame Donald Trump for the death of the USFL, despite all the issues that plagued it before he bought the New Jersey Generals. Steve Young, Hall of Fame quarterback and former USFL athlete, called Trump’s involvement in the league “suicidal.”</p>
<p>“That’s unfortunate, because I think the USFL had developed its own little following and (some) teams would still be here if they would have just left it in the spring,” Young told USA Today.</p>

<p>It was April 1997 when doctors told Austin Prario’s parents that their newborn son might not live to see his first birthday.</p>
<p>Nearly 20 years later, the Rhode Island native has not only proven that prediction wrong ― he’s completed the 121st Boston Marathon.</p>
<p>Prario made his way across the finish line of the race on Monday as cheers erupted from the crowd. His doctors believe he may be the first person with his type of heart condition to complete the famously challenging 26.2-mile race, which he finished in just over 6 hours and 14 minutes.</p>
<p>Prario was born with a rare congenital heart defect that prevents the muscle’s fourth chamber from functioning properly, meaning his heart might operate at 75 percent of its capacity or less under stress.</p>
<p>“[Doctors] told us that with surgery, Austin could lead a normal life, but that he would never be a varsity athlete or be able to finish something like the Boston Marathon,” Prario’s dad, Dave Prario, told Runner’s World earlier last week.</p>
<p>That message didn’t sit well with him. He was determined to have his son cross the Boston Marathon finish line one way or another.</p>
<p>In 1998, Dave Prario ran the Boston Marathon to raise money for the Boston Children’s Hospital, which had diagnosed his son just one year earlier. He carried the 1-year-old boy across the finish line while wearing a shirt that read “You gotta have heart!”</p>
<p>Austin Prario had a difficult first 18 months of life, undergoing three open heart surgeries that left him with a scar running the length of his chest.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he defied his doctors’ predictions for his life and became an avid athlete and sports fanatic. He ran cross-country in elementary school ― despite losing every race ― and went on to play a few sports in high school. Today, he’s a sophomore at Community College of Rhode Island and an assistant track coach at a local high school.</p>
<p>Prario made the decision to follow in his father’s footsteps last summer. His cardiologist OK’d the ambitious endeavor, recommending at least two years of training to prepare. But he didn’t want to wait any longer.</p>
<p>Less than a year of training later, Austin has defied all odds. He completed the course by early Monday afternoon before taking another finish line photo next to his dad, who ran the race as a guide for mobility impaired runners.</p>
<p>Prario also raised more than $17,000 for Boston Children’s Hospital to honor the doctors who saved his life ― and was 90 percent toward his $20,000 goal as of Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>“This is for all the people that said I could do it and for all the people that said I couldn’t,” he told Runner’s World last week. “I only have one life and doctors fixed it to the best of their ability. Why not show them everything I can do with it?”</p>

<p>NBA great Shaquille O’Neal is doing what he can to help a grieving mother who found her son dead after he accidentally shot himself with a gun earlier this week. </p>
<p>Shaniqua Stephens was downstairs in the family’s home in Forest Park, Georgia, on Monday night when she heard a loud bang. She went upstairs and found her 13-year-old son, Malachi Hemphill, had accidentally shot himself while playing with a gun live on Instagram. Doctors later pronounced him dead.</p>
<p>“He was my only son. He was only just 13. Just the thought of me seeing him on the floor will never leave my brain,” Stephens said. She has also said that she does not know how her son came to be in possession of the gun.</p>
<p>O’Neal has offered to cover the funeral services for Hemphill’s family. </p>
<p>“No mother should have to go through this,” the Hall of Famer said, according to a statement provided to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “I can only imagine the pain that she and all of Malachi’s family must be feeling.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to do what I could to help them at such a terrible time,” he added.</p>

<p>In a tragic accident, retired NFL player Todd Heap fatally struck his 3-year-daughter while moving his truck in the driveway of his Mesa home in Arizona on Friday evening, police said.</p>
<p>The little girl was rushed to a local hospital, where doctors declared her dead.</p>
<p>Police said Heap, 37, was checked and there were no indications that he was impaired at the time of the accident. Nor were there any suspicious circumstances linked to the accident, ABC-15 reported. An investigation is continuing.</p>
<p>Mesa-born Heap was a standout football star at Mountain View High School in Mesa and later at Arizona State University. </p>
<p>He was a first-round draft pick in 2001 and played 10 seasons with the Baltimore Ravens. He played his last two seasons with the Arizona Cardinals before he retired in 2012. </p>
<p>The Ravens issued a statement in support of Heap Saturday, saying the team’s “thoughts and hearts are with the Heaps, who have contributed so much to the Ravens and the Baltimore community.”</p>
<p>Many other Twitter users also posted messages of support for Heap and his family:</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Longo signed a letter of intent to play for Adams State University, a Division II school in Alamosa, Colorado, ESPN wrote. About a dozen women have played football for NCAA schools but none was on a scholarship, according to the sports network.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that she was a pioneer in collegiate athletics, Longo told CNN, “I was completely shocked.”</p>
<p>She explained to USA Today that she contacted Adams State during the season, sent highlight tapes and heard back from the school soon after. She then visited the campus and fell in love with it. When Adams State offered her the scholarship, she said (per ABC 15), “I’m just so unbelievably grateful that somebody game me a chance.”</p>
<p>Longo made 30 of 33 extra-point attempts and hit a 30-yard field goal last season for Basha High School in Chandler, Arizona. But she apparently has greater range. Here she is in practice connecting from 48 yards out.</p>
<p> “There is no doubt she can be competitive,” Adams State coach Timm Rosenbach, a former NFL quarterback, told the Arizona Republic. “She has a strong leg, and she can be very accurate.” </p>
<p>Longo also plans to play basketball for Adams State.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney died on Thursday, the team announced. He was 84.</p>
<p>No cause of death was released.</p>
<p>Rooney was admitted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000. He served as general manager of the club from 1975-2003.</p>
<p>Rooney’s father, Art, purchased the Steelers in 1933 and the family has run the team since that time. Pittsburgh has won six Super Bowl titles under the family’s leadership.</p>
<p>“Few men have contributed as much to the National Football League as Dan Rooney,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. “A member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he was one of the finest men in the history of our game and it was a privilege to work alongside him for so many years.</p>
<p>“Dan’s dedication to the game, to the players and coaches, to his beloved Pittsburgh, and to Steelers fans everywhere was unparalleled. He was a role model and trusted colleague to commissioners since Bert Bell, countless NFL owners, and so many others in and out of the NFL. A voice of reason on a wide range of topics, including diversity and labor relations, Dan always had the league’s best interests at heart.</p>
<p>“For my part, Dan’s friendship and counsel were both inspiring and irreplaceable. My heart goes out to Patricia, Art, and the entire Rooney family on the loss of this extraordinary man.”</p>
<p>Rooney also led the charge of identifying minority head-coaching candidates while leading the league’s diversity meeting. The edict that teams with openings must interview at least one minority candidate became known as the “Rooney Rule.”</p>
<p>When the Steelers needed a coach after the resignation of Bill Cowher following the 2006, they hired Mike Tomlin, the first black coach in franchise history.</p>
<p>Rooney also was a key figure in helping end the 57-day players’ strike in 1982.</p>
<p>His first job with the club was as a water boy at 12. He graduated from Duquesne in 1955 and started working in the front office, leading to his eventual stint as the general manager.</p>
<p>More recently, Rooney served as U.S. Ambassador to Ireland from 2009-12.</p>
<p>Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson is among the owners saddened by Rooney’s passing.</p>
<p>“My heart is heavy today as the passing of Dan Rooney leaves a void that can never be filled,” Richardson said in a statement. “No one in the National Football League provided me more friendship and counsel over the past 25 years than Dan, and I will always cherish our time together. Dan was a cornerstone of the National Football League and leaves a lasting mark on the game he loved both on and off the field.</p>
<p>“His lifetime of service to his team, the NFL, his city and his country earned Dan the respect and love of so many. He will be dearly missed. Rosalind and I send our thoughts and prayers to theRooney family and the entire Steelers organization.”</p>
<p>Baltimore Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti also issued a statement.</p>
<p>“Dan Rooney was the conscience of the NFL while serving as one of the powerful influences recently and in the history of our league,” Bisciotti said. “While a winner and a competitor at the highest level, he was kind, classy and a true gentleman. He was a giant in our industry.</p>
<p>“Mr. Rooney was so gracious, warm and welcoming when I joined the league. I feel blessed to have known him, and our prayers and thoughts are with his wonderful family.”</p>

<p>How do the highest achievers think differently? Consider the professional athletes who have won multiple championships: the Tom Bradys and Kobe Bryants of the world. They’ve mastered their craft, but their mindsets also set them apart from their peers. What do they do differently to reach peak performance? </p>
<p>Dr. Stan Beecham is a sports psychologist, and director and found member of the Leadership Resource Center in Atlanta, Georgia. He’s the author of Elite Minds: How Winners Think Differently to Create a Competitive Edge and Maximize Success. Dr. Beecham has worked with the best of the best from all over the world, and has discovered some fascinating insights regarding ultra-successful people.</p>
<p>I recently interviewed Dr. Beecham to learn from those insights. (The transcript below has been edited lightly for space and clarity.)</p>
<p>Kevin Kruse: You say that the primary determinant of success isn’t talent or experience; it’s mindset. </p>
<p>Stan Beecham: Division one athletes are basically the top 1% of high school athletes. You could argue that professional athletes are another top five to 1% of those. When you get at that level, say for example, in professional football, the reality is everyone is talented. </p>
<p>I’ve had the chance now for the last 25 years of working with these populations where everyone is talented. It becomes an issue of, “Who are the kids that really fully maximize their talent? What are the things that get in the way that keep them from realizing their talent?” </p>
<p>Do you really love this sport? But not only do you love this sport, do you love to practice? Do you love to go to the gym? If you’ve got two kids with equal talent and one kid loves to practice, then his whole experience of practice is going to be different because he’s doing something he wants to do.</p>
<p>At the same time, you might also find kids who are okay with themselves. They’re not trying to win someone’s approval or show that they’re good enough. They’re just playing the sport out of the joy of it. These kids have a huge competitive advantage. We know that human beings are at their best when they’re in the zone, when we’re not concerned about ourselves. In fact, we don’t even think.</p>
<p>People who’ve dabbled in sports psychology, they say, “Well, the kid who’s the better performer, they think differently.” </p>
<p>The reality is not that they think differently. It’s that they don’t think. It’s the absence of thought. It’s the absence of cognition. It’s the absence of emotion. That really is the advantage.</p>
<p>Kruse: It’s as if the unconscious mind moves so fast that it triggers faster than our conscious thinking, so we have to actually impact the unconscious.</p>
<p>Beecham: Let’s break it down. We know that it’s the mental game that counts, whether it’s sports or business. Because the mind is controlling the body. You have to think of the brain as the computer system, and you have to think of your belief system as your software. </p>
<p>So, you could be gifted, and you could be in great shape, but if the way that your mind is functioning is counter to that, you’ll never realize that physical potential. The starting place is to become conscious of your own thought process. Most of us, we go through the day and we’re thinking all day long. That’s what the mind does. It thinks, and you’re either aware of the thought or you’re not, but you’re thinking all the time. </p>
<p>For example, for an athlete going into a competition, if my belief about myself is, “I’m not as good as other people and I’m not as good as these other guys,” I carry that with me all the time, this sense of not being good enough or not being adequate. Then, you can see that there are certain thoughts that I’m going to have which is, “I need to play really well to do well,” and so that belief system of what you hold as true is going to lead to a certain way of thinking, which is going to lead to a certain way of acting.</p>
<p>If you think of people who consistently win, you would say, “Well, they win all the time because they want to win, right? They want it bad enough.” The reality is that’s not true at all. It’s that people that win and succeed at a high level, they don’t actually think about winning. They simply believe they’re going to do well.</p>
<p>In other words, if I know I’m going to win the game, then why would I even think about winning the game? If there’s some uncertainty as to how I’m going to do, “Am I going to win or not?” I will spend a lot of time thinking about that.</p>
<p>Kruse: In terms of these unconscious beliefs in a work setting, I unconsciously might think I don’t have a shot at a promotion, and that could affect my performance in the interview.</p>
<p>Beecham: Yeah. What I would say to that person is, number one, don’t do your job with the intention of getting promoted or recognized. Just do your job to the best of your ability. </p>
<p>In other words, if I start my career with the belief that I’m going to have a successful career and I’m going to get a lot of opportunities, and when I get an opportunity, I know I’m going to nail it. Then, when I go to work, what I’m thinking about is doing my job to the best of my ability. I think the kid who goes to work every day and they’re trying to win someone’s approval so that they can get a promotion or a raise, people sense that.</p>
<p>You know that guy. </p>
<p>The best way to get a raise, the best way to get recognized is to not worry about it. Just do your job really well. The other people that are competent around you, they’re going to see that you’re competent, and they’re going to offer you opportunities.</p>
<p>Kruse: But what if I’m a pitcher who really thinks we’re going to win the game and I’m going to get nine strikeouts, but there’s that great hot batter that’s been batting .450 lately. Or, I’m that sales professional; I can say that I’m going to win this deal, but in the back of my mind, I know we’re up against the tough competitor and budgets are tight. What do we do to massage that unconscious or to really anchor that belief system?</p>
<p>Beecham: Here’s the reality of human beings. We’re dynamic and we’re always changing. Let’s go back to the salesperson. One Monday, every time I call on someone, I thought I was going to get a yes and get their business, but I made six sales calls on Monday and everybody said no. Now, it’s Tuesday, and all of a sudden, I’m not feeling so confident.</p>
<p>You see this in sport too where athletes go from having a lot of confidence to not. It’s true for all of us. It’s true for the best. The question is, how do I get back to it? It really goes back to looking at the bigger picture, and reminding myself that I had a bad day because everybody has a bad day.</p>
<p>One of the things that’s a problem with our hero-worship society is, we think of these people who are these great folks as successful people. We don’t think that they struggle and experience failure the way that we do, but the fact of the matter is they do.</p>
<p>In other words, most people’s definition of success is the avoidance of failure. People who are really successful will tell you their definition of success is their response to failure, and they would actually argue that you have to have failure. In other words, there’s no such thing of success without failure.</p>
<p>Kruse: You say we need to stop trying to get better all the time. What do you mean?</p>
<p>Beecham: We all live in a culture and society that’s obsessed with better, right? We’ve been taught since day one that in order to be successful, you have to always want to get better and at the moment you quit trying to get better, then the competition is going to pass you up.</p>
<p>I believed that for most of my career. What I’ve just learned in the last five years, is I really sat with this obsession with better and really said, “What is this about? Like what is this born out of?” What I realized is that the reason that we, most of us, want to be better is because we fundamentally believe that we’re not good enough yet. </p>
<p>The problem with better is better is about the future. You can’t get better now. But performance, everything that you do, you do in the now. You do in the present moment.</p>
<p>Whatever the situation that you’re in, even if it’s not an ideal situation, you could still make the best of it. If you consistently do your best, what’s going to happen to over time? You get better. You grow and develop by consistently doing your best.</p>
<p>What I want people to understand is, is no matter what you think about yourself, you are good enough to do your best right now. No matter how hard you try, you can’t be better than what you are. I know at first, it looks like a play on words…but what we have to understand is, is this culture that’s obsessed with better is also an anxious culture. </p>
<p>25% of American population has a diagnosable mental disorder, and 80% of that or 20% of us have an anxiety disorder, and anxiety is about the future. When the mind goes to the future, you quit performing at your best, so what we know about when human beings are at their best, they don’t go forward in the future. They don’t go backwards in the past. They stay present, and the mind gets really quiet, and you function optimally. The problem that I have with better is it keeps pulling you to the future.</p>
<p>If you’re a leader, just go to people and say, “Look, all I’m asking you to do is do the best that you can.” If you’re a leader of an organization whether it’d be sport or business, what I would say is if you could get the people on your team to perform at their best, then you’re doing your job at a high level.</p>

<p>Rivalry between soccer fans was touchingly put to one side after explosions forced the postponement of a match in Germany on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Officials rescheduled the Champions League quarter-final tie between Germany’s Borussia Dortmund and France’s A.S. Monaco F.C. for Wednesday after three blasts hit near the home team’s bus as it drove players to the Signal Iduna Park stadium.</p>
<p>But the 24-hour adjournment left thousands of the visiting French team’s supporters stranded without a place to stay. That was until compassionate home team fans began tweeting offers of accommodation via the #bedforawayfans hashtag:</p>
<p>Within hours of the hashtag gaining traction, supporters who’d benefited from the spontaneous initiative began posting pictures of where they were staying.</p>
<p>Note how many of the photographs feature people wearing shirts from both teams:</p>
<p>Police said Wednesday the motive behind the blasts remained unclear.</p>
<p>Borussia Dortmund defender Marc Bartra was the sole player to be hospitalized following the incident, after he was struck by falling shards of glass.</p>
<p>“Bartra was injured, on his hand and his arm, but nothing that would be life-threatening,” said the club’s chief executive, Hans-Joachim Watzke. “The team is in complete shock.”</p>

<p>There’s something special about this time of year. Days stretch longer, temperatures ease higher, grass grows greener. That joyous mix is a testament to the arrival of spring… and baseball season.</p>
<p>From neighborhood parks to major league stadiums, it’s easy to find a game these days.</p>
<p>But do you know what’s getting harder to find around our national pastime?</p>
<p>Tobacco.</p>
<p>Generations of players and coaches kept chew, dip or snuff in their mouths. Bulges in their cheeks and frequent streams of brown spit were telltale signs. The nastiness of the habit was dismissed because it was considered part of the game. Even as public sentiment turned against smoking and other forms of the deadly substance, tobacco remained entrenched in baseball.</p>
<p>The tide began turning in May 2015. San Francisco banned tobacco products at sports facilities, taking tobacco out of its MLB ballpark. Just two years later, 14 of the 30 big-league stadiums are tobacco-free.</p>
<p>Tobacco belongs in baseball’s past. I look forward to the day when it’s lumped with banned substances like spitballs and steroids, and recalled as a relic of a bygone generation like flannel uniforms and train rides. The health of future generations depends on it.</p>
<p>Knock Tobacco Out of the Park is the campaign that’s powered this wonderful change, and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids is the organization behind it. It is my pleasure to turn this spot over to the organization’s president, Matthew L. Myers, to continue this important, timely conversation.</p>
<p>As a boy in New York in the 1950s, my first baseball memory was of the 1954 World Series when my childhood idol, Willie Mays of the New York Giants, made one of the most famous catches in baseball history. What most people don’t remember was that a little known player named Dusty Rhodes was the Giants’ most valuable player in that World Series. And while Willie played the game the way you were supposed to ― with abandon, joy, flair, and as a true role model for kids ― I still recall seeing Dusty Rhodes with chewing tobacco in his jaw rounding the bases after winning Game One with walk-off homer.</p>
<p>Too many Major Leaguers still use smokeless tobacco ― like chew, dip, and snuff ― setting a terrible example for the millions of kids watching the game and emulating their favorite players. It is time to break the long and harmful link between baseball and tobacco for good. Our national pastime should promote a healthy and active lifestyle, not a deadly and addictive product.</p>
<p>Tragic events over the last few years have driven home the seriousness of the problem. In June 2014, Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn died at age 54 after a long battle with salivary gland cancer, which he attributed to his longtime use of chewing tobacco. Two months later, pitching great Curt Schilling, only 47, announced his treatment for oral cancer that he said was “without a doubt, unquestionably” caused by 30 years of chewing tobacco. It shouldn’t have taken such high-profile tragedies to draw attention to the issue, but if something good comes from them then that will be a positive development.</p>
<p>When the 2017 Major League Baseball season opened this month, more ballparks and games were tobacco-free than ever before ― a great message to fans young and old. Thanks to our Knock Tobacco Out of the Park campaign, nearly half the Major League stadiums (14 of 30) are now completely tobacco-free as a result of state and local laws that have prohibited the use of all tobacco products within their sports facilities. San Francisco was the first city to take tobacco out of baseball back in May 2015. Less than 18 months later, MLB saw its first tobacco-free post-season games, including a tobacco-free World Series winner in Chicago.</p>
<p>Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, New York, San Francisco, St. Louis, St. Petersburg (Tampa Bay) and Washington, D.C., have all enacted laws prohibiting tobacco use at sports venues, including their professional baseball stadiums. A statewide law in California is also in effect this season.</p>
<p>In addition, the new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) reached last year between owners and players prohibits new MLB players from using smokeless tobacco. The agreement also makes violations of local tobacco-free stadium laws violations of the CBA as well, strengthening enforcement.</p>
<p>This amazing progress makes it a matter of when, not if, baseball becomes completely tobacco-free. The remaining MLB cities can make it happen sooner rather than later by prohibiting smokeless tobacco use at their sports venues. We won't rest until the long and harmful link between baseball and tobacco is broken for good.</p>
<p>The need for action is all too clear. High school athletes use smokeless tobacco at nearly twice the rate of non-athletes, and among male high school athletes, smokeless tobacco use is particularly alarming at 17.4 percent. Even as we’ve made incredible strides in reducing youth smoking, smokeless use continues at disturbingly high rates. But we’re not giving up.</p>
<p>To cities that haven't adopted the new policy yet, let me offer this closing thought. The Chicago Cubs went 108 years without a championship, but within four months of prohibiting smokeless tobacco at Wrigley Field, the city hoisted a World Series banner. Now, we cannot guarantee that other cities and teams will enjoy that same success, but what Major League city wouldn’t want to do everything it can to enhance its chances for a championship? It’s time to take tobacco out of baseball completely.</p>

<p>Elusiveness, fluidity and patience are attributes that generally serve players well in college football and the NFL alike. Former Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey has all of these qualities, which is why I expect him to make a smooth transition to the pro game. It’s also why he puts me strongly in mind of the Atlanta Falcons’ Devonta Freeman.</p>
<p>Freeman, who’s earned consecutive Pro Bowl honors during the past two seasons, was a fourth-round draft pick out of Florida State in 2014. That was in large part because he lacked size at 5 feet 8 inches and 206 pounds, and because he ran an uninspiring 4.58 40 at the combine. McCaffrey is listed at 6 feet even and 197 pounds, which may not help his draft stock but won’t hurt it much either. </p>
<p>While I expected a strong performance at the combine from McCaffrey, it turned out to be nothing short of brilliance. McCaffrey clocked a 4.48 40. Just as impressive were his 37 1/2 vertical jump, 4.22 20-yard shuttle, 6.57 second 3-cone drill and 11.03 60-yard shuttle, all tops for running backs in Indianapolis. </p>
<p>What really separates McCaffrey from other prospects, and what heightens the parallels with Freeman, is his incredible versatility as a runner and pass-catcher. Call him a Swiss army knife, if you like.</p>
<p>According to ESPN The Magazine, McCaffrey ― who turns 21 in June ― ranked second in the nation among Power 5 running backs on rushing plays directed outside the tackles during the 2015 and 2016 seasons. Additionally, he was slotted fifth in catch percentage and third in yards after catch. </p>
<p>And being a capable pass-catching back isn’t just about the screen game. The next step is the slot ― and then on wheel routes ― where few guys have the quickness and the hands needed. Marshawn Lynch was great at this, David Johnson can do it, and Le’Veon Bell excels.</p>
<p>Freeman, to his credit, is also deft in such a role for the Falcons. When your running back isn’t merely a three-down guy, but also someone who can really catch the ball, offenses open up and become that much more dangerous. McCaffrey, for his part, possesses the necessary elusiveness and willingness to make “traffic” catches, which bodes well.</p>
<p>There’s also McCaffrey’s dynamic punt and kick return ability. In 2015, he broke the all-time single-season NCAA record with 3,864 all-purpose yards. This past year, despite woeful quarterback play, he still managed to rush for over 1,600 yards and a whopping 16 total touchdowns. As a comparison, Freeman also scored 16 touchdowns as a junior, albeit on 1,000 yards and a 5.9 rush average (McCaffrey’s was 6.3).</p>
<p>When it comes down to the draft, it doesn’t really matter whether McCaffrey is the second, third or sixth running back off the board. I’d even argue that as a pro, his game translates better than it did as a collegian.</p>
<p>Versatility in the NFL is rewarded in spades ― roles are carved out to really maximize talent. (Think Danny Woodhead, Darren Sproles and Tyreek Hill.) To be sure, defenses are much better ― faster and more complex ― but while everyone game-planned for McCaffrey as the Cardinal’s first, second and even third option, that won’t be the case in the league. Better yet, vision ― undoubtedly one of his best skills ― also makes for an easier transition than, say, just being a power back. (Ask Tyrone Wheatley, Ron Dayne or Trent Richardson about that.)</p>
<p>This is not to say McCaffrey is another Le’Veon Bell, but that’s where the comparison to the Steelers’ megastar running back makes sense. Dictating to the defense instead of letting the defense dictate to you ― that’s how both of these guys prefer to run the football. It is very, very hard to do, and it doesn’t necessarily mean McCaffrey, a former Heisman finalist, will automatically become a great player. But it definitely helps.</p>
<p>All in all, McCaffrey and his dynamic versatility remind me of no one so much as Devonta Freeman. I suspect he will soon be one of the league’s most productive running backs, and perhaps just as importantly, a three-down back as well.</p>

<p>The U.S. women’s national hockey team became the world champions Friday at the International Ice Hockey Federation’s Women’s World Championship in Plymouth, Michigan. U.S. forward Hilary Knight scored the winning goal in overtime, ending the game with a 3-2 lead over Canada.</p>
<p>The team’s stunning victory came less than two weeks after it won a more personal battle against USA Hockey, the sport’s national governing body, over fair pay for female players. </p>
<p>More than a year of private negotiations between the U.S. women’s national team and USA Hockey reached a boiling point in mid-March when the team threatened to boycott the women’s world championships if its requests for a “livable wage” and adequate financial support were not met.</p>
<p>The players had claimed that the national federation provided the women with only small monthly stipends over a six-month Olympic training period and did not pay players at all for the other three and a half years of each Olympic cycle. They also argued that the federation’s financial support for the men’s team ― including marketing, travel and developmental programs ― was significantly larger than for the women’s division.</p>
<p>For example, the women’s team argued that USA Hockey spent $3.5 million annually on its national team program for boys, yet the girls’ division received no “comparable support.”</p>
<p>USA Hockey initially disputed the women’s claims and began searching for athletes to replace members of the women’s team. But, nearly two weeks after the women had launched their boycott, USA Hockey and the women’s team reached a deal ― one day before the championships began.</p>
<p>The team has now won eight of the last 10 world championship medals, according to IIHF’s website.</p>
<p>“Our sport is the big winner today,” Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain, said after they settled their negotiations. “We stood up for what we thought was right, and USA Hockey’s leadership listened. In the end, both sides came together.”</p>
<p>Hockey USA and the women’s team agreed to keep the financial terms of their deal private. Under the agreement, which covers the next four years, the federation will form a new advisory group made up of current and former players that will assist the federation in efforts to advance both girls’ and women’s hockey.</p>
<p>Knight, the U.S. forward who scored Friday’s winning goal, was vocal about the women’s fight for fair pay throughout the battle.</p>
<p>“The thing that gives us the most pride, I have to say, is knowing that we set a foundation for the younger generations to build upon,” Knight told the Edge of Sports podcast Tuesday. “That’s something I’ll be most proud of when I can take a second to really appreciate that, years down the line. We did it.”</p>
<p>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated that the U.S. women’s hockey team deal covered a five-year period that included the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo and the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup. Their deal covers the next four years and does not involve either of the aforementioned events.</p>

<p>Atlanta Falcons standout cornerback Desmond Trufant has agreed to a massive five-year contract extension with the team, according to multiple sources who spoke with The Huffington Post. </p>
<p>The contract is worth $69 million, with Trufant earning nearly $14 million per season and almost $42 million in guaranteed money. Trufant, who was previously signed through the 2017-18 NFL season, is now under contract for the next six seasons with Atlanta. The deal makes him the fourth-highest paid cornerback in the NFL in terms of guaranteed dollars.</p>
<p>With the league shifting more and more toward passing, possessing quality corners has become increasingly important. The 26-year-old Trufant earned Pro Bowl honors in 2015, and was likely well on his way to another selection last season before requiring season-ending surgery after suffering a pectoral injury.</p>
<p>As a precaution, the former Falcons’ first-round pick will be held out of offseason workouts, but clearly the team isn’t worried.</p>
<p>“Trufant is coming along great,” head coach Dan Quinn recently said at the NFC coaches breakfast in Phoenix. “We won’t have him practice during [organized team activities (OTAs)], but by the time we get to training camp, he’ll be ready to go and battle.”</p>
<p>All in all, it has been a highly productive and eventful offseason for GM Thomas Dimitroff and the entire organization. As the team gets set to debut its $1.6 billion new state-of-the-art Mercedes Benz Stadium, it will do so with a new offensive coordinator in Steve Sarkisian ― a story first broken by HuffPost ― after former OC Kyle Shanahan left to become the head coach of the 49ers.</p>
<p>While the record-breaking Atlanta offense ― led by MVP Matt Ryan and All-World receiver Julio Jones ― garners most of the headlines, it’s worth noting that the Falcons defense improved dramatically during the second half of last season.</p>
<p>During its final nine games, it surrendered only 22 points per matchup, totaling an impressive 22 sacks and 18 forced turnovers, including a pick-six of Tom Brady in Super Bowl LI.</p>
<p>In turn, retaining a shutdown corner like Trufant (who has 48 career passes defensed) for the long-term is undeniably a huge boon for a promising young defense that helped propel the franchise to its second ever Super Bowl appearance.</p>
<p>Trufant will once again join forces with Jalen Collins and Robert Alford, two other young corners who played well in his absence. </p>
<p>Trufant is also flanked by safety Keanu Neal (Atlanta’s 2016 first-rounder), who led all rookies with five forced fumbles last year, while ranking second with 106 tackles.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about linebacker Deion Jones either. The 2016 second-rounder ― notice a theme here ― led all rookies with 108 tackles last season and was tied for first with three interceptions. Rounding out the defense is 24-year-old outside linebacker Vic Beasley, Jr., who led the league with 15.5 sacks last year. </p>

<p>Tim Tebow has struggled to revive his athletics career as a pro baseball player. But the former football star still managed to deliver a dramatic moment on Thursday in his minor-league season debut.</p>
<p>Tebow hit a two-run home run in his first at-bat to help the Class A Columbia, South Carolina, Fireflies to a 14-7 victory over the visiting Augusta GreenJackets, ESPN reported.</p>
<p>“All of my sports experiences helped me for moments like that,” the former Heisman Trophy winner and Denver Broncos quarterback told the network. “Playing in The Swamp or Death Valley or in Mile High Stadium in the playoffs, they all helped.”</p>
<p>Granted, it was just one moment in one low-minors game; the Mets’ signee also struck out three times. But another look shows the crowd getting pretty excited.</p>

<p>Cardinals’ outfielder Stephen Piscotty exited the game against the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday night after he was hit by three baseballs in one trip around the bases. </p>
<p>A video posted to Twitter shows the three instances in which Piscotty was hit ― first at bat, then as he ran to second and again when he ran home. </p>
<p>Piscotty was hit twice in the elbow, but the last hit to the head caused him to exit the game, USA Today reported. He cleared concussion protocol Wednesday, according to ESPN, and was cleared to play, but Wednesday’s game against the Cubs was postponed due to rain. For the makeup game, the Cardinals will host the Cubs in St. Louis on Thursday. </p>
<p>Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Piscotty said of the final blow, “It just stunned me. It wasn’t like I lost consciousness. I was fine.”</p>
<p>In 2015, Piscotty was carted off the field after a violent collision in the outfield with teammate Peter Bourjos left the player unconscious. </p>
<p>“The one in Pittsburgh I came out very, very fortunate,” Piscotty said Wednesday, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. “That one could have been very serious. I think the fact that I got hit three times [Tuesday] night makes it more dramatic.”</p>

<p>Legendary captain Derek Jeter has reportedly expressed interest in buying the Miami Marlins, a Major League Baseball team, an anonymous source told Fox Business.</p>
<p>The former New York Yankees captain is supposedly part of a team of prospective buyers that’s up against former Florida Governor Jeb Bush to buy the franchise. Jeter expressed interest in owning a Major League Baseball team an interview last May with CNBC’s Squawk Box.</p>
<p>“The thing that I’m interested in is making the game grow,” Jeter said. “I mean I think baseball is starting taking somewhat of a backseat to some of the other sports, and in my mind I think this is the greatest sport in the world. And I’m interested in helping the game grow.” </p>
<p>And the Marlins sure do need growth.</p>
<p>The Marlins were one of the worst teams in the league at one point, but they have been doing better in recent years. Recruitment of rookies such as Giancarlo Stanton has pushed the team back into the spotlight after the team’s 2003 World Series win. The team rebranded from the Florida Marlins to the Miami Marlins in 2012. They also moved into a new stadium.</p>
<p>According to Forbes’ team evaluation, the Marlins are worth an estimated $675 million after factoring in operation cost and payroll. </p>
<p>Jeter left baseball in 2014 after nearly 20 years in with the Yankees. Shortly after his retirement he announced the launch of The Players’ Tribune, a website dedicated to giving athletes a platform to express themselves. </p>
<p>“So I’m in the process of building a place where athletes have the tools they need to share what they really think and feel,” he said on a post on the site. “We want to have a way to connect directly with our fans, with no filter.”</p>
<p>The 42-year-old retiree is also working on an anti-bullying campaign as well as his Turn 2 Foundation, a program to keep children away from drugs and alcohol. The former shortstop is about to embark on fatherhood with his wife, Hannah. </p>

<p>Amazon has confirmed a deal with the National Football League to give Prime members streaming access to the league’s Thursday Night Football games when the season starts in September. </p>
<p>It’s costing Amazon $50 million, according to The Wall Street Journal, to air the 10 games.</p>
<p>Amazon already offers Prime members the ability to add special subscription packages, such as Showtime and Starz, for an additional price, but the new NFL package will be free for subscribers. </p>
<p>“We’re focused on bringing our customers what they want to watch, Prime members want the NFL,” Amazon Senior Vice President Jeff Blackburn told The Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>Amazon beat out bids from Google, Facebook and Twitter to have the exclusive online streaming rights. This isn’t the first time the NFL has tried to move into the world of streaming. Twitter had a similar deal with the league last year for only $10 million dollars, according to a Bloomberg report. </p>
<p>This might be the right move for the NFL if they want to hold on to younger viewers. Cable subscriptions have been dwindling over the last few years as customers move toward cheaper streaming packages and services. About 25 percent of American households now go without any cable or satellite packages, according to a report by market research company GfK. That number goes up to 38 percent for the 18- to 34-year-old demographic. </p>

<p>New York has two baseball teams. The New York Yankees and the New York Mets. For as long as I can remember, except for the “Miracle Mets season of 1969” it’s always been the NY Yankees capturing the majority of the back sports pages and fans of New York City.</p>
<p>However I believe that has been changing a bit. For example, I have been seeing many more NY Mets hats and jerseys in the streets of our five boroughs that I am used to seeing. The fact that the Mets have been having more winning seasons lately than the Yankees has much to do with it. Also, the fact that the Mets have players that many younger fans seem to relate to, Thor (Noah Syndergard), Captain America (David Wright), La Potencia Yoenis Cespedes to name a few makes them more of a conversation piece for younger fans.</p>
<p>The baseball Gods must be looking down on this Queens, almost New York’s foster child baseball club and that seemed to be evident for this 2017 season.</p>
<p>The NY Mets opening day game on Monday had a temperature that was pleasant for a baseball-opening day in New York. The sun was out and the above 60° temperature was perfect for the second largest opening day crowd in Mets history. The fact that it has been cold and cloudy for days before and the day after made it appear as if there was a divine intervention.</p>
<p>The fans came out and that was obvious as the Citi-Field parking lots were all full and there were cars parked in every available spot along the park leading up to City Field. There were also cars along the fence surrounding the Mets parking lots and the cars in every spot under the highway and along the now demolished streets where the once chop shops used to be.</p>
<p>The fans came out and they were not disappointed. The fans got to see what they were all waiting to see from the only New York team that has been bringing post-season games to the city. They saw one of their ace pitchers, Noah Syndergaard, pitch six scoreless innings, walking none and striking out seven with a combination of high-90s sinkers and demonic breaking balls, all below a low pitch count of 86.</p>
<p>They saw some key hitting and running when Wilmer Flores raced home from second base on a single to center field by Asdrubal Cabrera. Flores not necessarily known for fast feet made this one close when the umpires out call were overturned after a video review (I’m sure many Mets fans were praising MLB for bringing video review to the game). That made the score 1-0 and jumped started the Mets offence to eventually</p>
<p>Fans wanted to see Mets batters like, Curtis Granderson who drove in a run with a sacrifice fly and Bruce who drew a bases-loaded walk and Lucas Duda who cleared the bases with a double to left-center field. Fans also saw clutch hitting a good defense and a bullpen with Mets’ relievers. Hansel Robles and Fernando Salas who each tossed scoreless innings, and a closer like Gsellman who closed it out in the ninth, getting some work as he waits for his first start.</p>
<p>It was a great opening day game with the Mets beating the Braves 6-0. But they also gave all of New York something to cheer when the other team, New York Yankees lost their away opening day game to the Rays by a score of 7-3. Lets see how the Baseball Gods shine on the Bronx team next Monday for their home opener vs the Rays.</p>

<p>GLENDALE, Ariz. ― North Carolina, one shot short of the national championship a year ago, made sure a potential heartbreaker did not even get to the rim this time.</p>
<p>The Tar Heels won their sixth national title, beating Gonzaga 71-65 in the NCAA Tournament finals at University of Phoenix Stadium on Monday night, with the key play being a late-game block by center Kennedy Meeks. His rejection of a shot by a driving Nigel Williams-Goss led to a decisive fastbreak dunk by Justin Jackson with 12 seconds left.</p>
<p>Coach Roy Williams earned his third national title at North Carolina, the first since 2009. The Tar Heels lost to Villanova last season on a last-second shot by Kris Jenkins.</p>
<p>This year’s title game was a cold-shooting, foul-filled affair, but what the game lacked in aesthetics, it made up for in drama, with the game on the line in the final minute.</p>
<p>Forward Isaiah Hicks made a hanging jumper in the lane with 26 seconds left for a 68-65 North Carolina lead before Williams-Goss, who had scored eight consecutive points for Gonzaga, was blocked on the other end.</p>
<p>UNC point guard Joel Berry II, who was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four, made two free throws with seven seconds left to finish with a game-high 22 points.</p>
<p>Gonzaga (37-2) missed nine consecutive shots in the second half and went 8:27 without a basket, but North Carolina (33-7) didn’t have the offense to deliver a decisive run as it remained a one-possession game for almost all of the second half.</p>
<p>All of the game’s key big men were in some sort of foul trouble in the second half.</p>
<p>Meeks picked up his fourth with 9:42 to go. Gonzaga’s Przemek Karnowski’s fourth foul came with 8:02 to go. The Bulldogs’ Zach Collins ― the hero of a Final Four win over South Carolina ― fouled out with 5:03 to go after playing only 14 minutes.</p>
<p>Jackson, the ACC Player of the Year, scored 16 points but missed all nine shots from 3-point range. Hicks had 13 points and nine rebounds.</p>
<p>Williams-Goss scored 15 points but was just 5 of 17 from the field. He added nine rebounds and six assists. Karnowski was 1 of 8 from the field for nine points. Guard Justin Perkins scored 13 ― all in the first half.</p>
<p>North Carolina shot 35.6 percent. Gonzaga shot 33.9 percent.</p>
<p>It was a disastrous start to the second half for Gonzaga, which led 35-32 at the break. A steal on the first possession led to an all-alone layup by Berry, and Jackson’s two free throws gave North Carolina the lead 35 seconds into the half.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs committed two turnovers, missed their first five shots and Collins picked up his third foul before coach Mark Few called timeout with 17:15 left, his team down 40-35. Collins committed his fourth foul with 15:53 left.</p>
<p>But the Bulldogs answered with an 8-0 run of their own, including Karnowski’s first points at the 14:34 mark, and the game settled down into a close battle between two No. 1 seeds.</p>

<p>We hear you, Frank Fleming.</p>
<p>The New York Mets fan had his Opening Day trip to see his beloved team delayed by a train derailment at Penn Station in New York City.</p>
<p>Take it away, Frank:</p>
<p>Fleming became somewhat of a viral star after his outburst.</p>
<p>But there’s a happy postscript to his five-hour ordeal of a commute from his home in Belleville, New Jersey. He told NBC New York that he missed the ceremonial first pitch but eventually arrived at Citi Field to see the Mets shut out the Atlanta Braves, 6-0.</p>
<p>“If they would have lost, that would have been just the cherry on top,” he said.</p>

<p> Who needs referees when we have TV viewers to officiate big-time sporting events? The LPGA decided a major tournament because a snitch of a golf fan notified the tour that Lexi Thompson incorrectly placed her ball back on the green by a sliver on a short putt, Deadspin reported. But wait, it gets crazier. The slightly errant ball placement happened on the 17th hole of Saturday’s ANA Inspiration in Rancho Mirage, California. The viewer reportedly emailed the complaint during Sunday’s final round. Thompson, who was two strokes in the lead, was notified before the 13th hole that she would be penalized 4 strokes ― two for improper ball placement and two for an incorrect scorecard. “Is this a joke?” Thompson asked, per the Associated Press. Told it wasn’t, she snapped: “This is ridiculous.” Watch the infraction for yourself here: </p>
<p> As word spread, Tiger Woods weighed in on Twitter, stating that “viewers at home should not be officials wearing stripes.” </p>
<p> Thompson, who appeared in tears at first, regrouped to force a playoff but lost to So Yeon Ryu, Golf magazine reported. “It’s unfortunate what happened,” Thompson said. “I did not mean that at all. I didn’t realize I did that. I felt strong through the finish, and it was great to see the fans behind me.” Here’s the LPGA’s explanation: </p>
<p>It’s difficult to picture such an incident happening in other games. Imagine, for instance, if fans watching Monday’s NCAA title basketball game between North Carolina and Gonzaga were allowed a chance to decide the outcome.</p>

<p>DALLAS ― South Carolina fended off Southeastern Conference rival Mississippi State for the biggest prize in women’s college basketball.</p>
<p>The Gamecocks led by as many as 14 points in the second half, then survived a Bulldogs charge to claim a 67-55 victory in the NCAA Tournament championship game on Sunday evening at the American Airlines Center.</p>
<p>In doing so, South Carolina (33-4), making its second Final Four appearance under head coach Dawn Staley, won its first national championship.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs couldn’t solve South Carolina, falling to the Gamecocks for the third time this season. But Mississippi State (34-5) can hold onto the distinction of being the team that ended Connecticut’s 111-game winning streak as the Bulldogs prevailed in 64-62 in overtime during a Friday semifinal.</p>
<p>Forward A’ja Wilson powered the Gamecocks on both offense and defense as she finished with 23 points, 10 rebounds and four blocks. Guard Allisha Gray pitched in 18 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
<p>Guard Victoria Vivians led Mississippi State with 12 points, and guard Dominique Dillingham added 11.</p>
<p>South Carolina held Bulldogs guard Morgan William, the hero in Mississippi State’s Elite Eight and national semifinal wins, to eight points on 2-of-6 shooting.</p>
<p>South Carolina was threatening to run away with the title before Mississippi State clawed back into the contest in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs grabbed momentum with a 9-0 run to slice into South Carolina’s 14-point lead. William’s made a steal and layup to highlight the run, then forward Ketara Chapel hit a jumper that cut the Gamecocks’ lead to 45-40 with 3:37 to go in the third quarter.</p>
<p>But Wilson and Gray made the key baskets South Carolina needed in the fourth quarter to keep the Gamecocks in the lead. They combined for baskets on back-to-back possessions in the middle of the fourth to restore an eight-point Gamecocks lead with 4:56 remaining, and Mississippi State never got back within six points.</p>
<p>South Carolina stretched out a 13-point lead in the first half as it dominated the end of the first quarter and the beginning of the second.</p>
<p>The Gamecocks trailed by two before they went on a 19-4 run to take control.</p>
<p>Gray scored seven points during the surge as she consistently drove into the lane. Wilson helped fuel the run with a layup and a pair of free throws to give South Carolina a 25-16 lead with 6:49 remaining until halftime.</p>
<p>Guard Tyasha Harris went to the basket for a layup to cap the run and stake the Gamecocks to a 13-point margin.</p>
<p>But Mississippi State battled back despite foul trouble and a scoring drought of more than four minutes in the first half.</p>
<p>Reserve forward Chinwe Okorie hit a jumper from the free-throw line, then Dillingham, who played most of the first half with two fouls, drove for a basket. And Vivians made a shot to cut South Carolina’s lead to nine.</p>
<p>Wilson and Gray each scored 11 to lead the Gamecocks in the first half. Wilson hit a free throw that put South Carolina ahead 36-26 at the break.</p>
<p>NOTES: The all-SEC national championship game between Mississippi State and South Carolina was the sixth time two teams from the same conference met for the tournament title. It was the third time two SEC teams played in the championship game ― Tennessee vs. Georgia in 1996 and Tennessee vs. Auburn in 1989. ... South Carolina and Mississippi State were each making their first appearance in the national championship game. That marked the first time that two first-timers met in the tournament final since 2005 when Baylor defeated Michigan State. ... South Carolina leads Mississippi State 19-16 in the all-time series. The Gamecocks have a 10-game winning streak in the rivalry that dates to Mississippi State’s last victory over South Carolina on Feb. 11, 2010.</p>

<p>DC United went into Saturday’s game against the Philadelphia Union, not only looking for their first win of the season, but their first goal of the season, having started out with 2 losses and a draw. Philadelphia came in with a slightly better record, with 2 draws and a loss, and started the game much brighter than United, with former United player Chris Pontius initially bossing their left wing.</p>
<p>For a portion of the first 10 minutes, it was as though Philadelphia were playing “keep away” with the ball, as United’s touches were few and far between...</p>
<p>...but eventually, United found their rhythm and began their own attacks through Lloyd Sam...</p>
<p>...Patrick Nyarko...</p>
<p>...Ian Harkes...</p>
<p>...Nick DeLeon, and others.</p>
<p>Luciano Acosta was his usual tricky form, jinxing left and right</p>
<p>In the 18th minute, Sam passed the ball into the box...</p>
<p>...to José Guillermo Ortiz who turned and fired towards goal, with the ball taking a deflection off Philadelphia’s Oguchi Onyewu taking it over Andre Blake in goal, to give United their first goal of the season.</p>
<p>After the restart, it was mostly United back on the attack, although a great save from Bill Hamid in the United goal did stop a potential equalizer in the 23rd minute. </p>
<p>In the 27th minute Acosta stole the ball from a Union player on the sideline, broke towards goal, and passed it to Ortiz...</p>
<p>...whose shot on goal was blocked by the hand of Richie Marquez, resulting in a penalty being awarded to United. Acosta, himself, stepped up and assuredly smacked it to the keeper’s right, just outside the outstretched arm of a diving Blake...</p>
<p>...resulting in a 2 goal lead for United.</p>
<p>United continued to attack down both flanks...</p>
<p>...but the half ended with the score 2-0. The second half was more of a mixed bag, with both teams attacking...</p>
<p>...but nothing making it to the back of the net to change the scoreline.</p>
<p>...until the 71st minute, when one minute after Ortiz was replaced by Lamar Neagle, and a shot from Alejandro Bedoya was tipped away by Hamid, straight into the path of substitute C.J. Sapong, who made no mistake in nestling the ball in the back of the net.</p>
<p>The rest of the game was an edgy affair, with both teams pressing forward, with perhaps Philadelphia having more of the ball.</p>
<p>...and nothing that United tried getting through.</p>
<p>...and Hamid doing the same to the Philadelphia strikers, denying Sapong with a brilliant save in the 78th minute.</p>
<p>United continued to attack...</p>
<p>...but the Philadelphia defense held firm...</p>
<p>...as did the United defense at the other end.</p>
<p>So the game ended 2-1 for United, giving them their first win of the season, and leaving Philadelphia still seeking theirs. </p>

<p>Another Premier League weekend at Old Trafford, another draw for Manchester United. Following the international break, where two of United’s centre-backs were injured, the Reds were back in Premier League action at home to West Bromwich Albion in what was a very important meeting for the race into the top four in an action-packed April.</p>
<p>With Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ander Herrera suspended for the match, and Smalling, Jones and Mata injured, the latter out indefinitely after having groin surgery Friday evening, Mourinho had to deal with a shortage of options. With Rashford up top and Martial and Mkhitaryan on the wings, the Reds certainly had attacking options available. Mourinho also fielded Carrick and Fellaini in midfield, with Valencia, Bailly, Rojo and Young in defence with De Gea in net. West Brom defeated Arsenal before the international break 3:1 and have been a surprisingly successful squad this season.</p>
<p>United started the match well and had 75% of possession throughout the match, but could not create much against West Brom’s well-disciplined defence. Baggies boss Tony Pulis had obviously set up his team to absorb pressure from the home side and play defensively, a tactic that has frustrated United all season. </p>
<p>Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Anthony Martial had the best chances of the match for United, the former being replaced by Wayne Rooney at 70 minutes. Rashford was unable to produce much with his runs and Carrick looked static in midfield, always passing sideways or backwards and remaining just in front of the back four. Even with several set-piece opportunities, Fellaini was the only real target in the box with Zlatan, Smalling and Pogba missing. Rashford had two great shots saved by keeper Ben Foster, including a free-kick from 25 yards. United were only able to register 8 shots, 3 of which were on target, all match. West Brom nearly had the lead after former Red Darren Fletcher took a long-range effort which caught De Gea by surprise and slipped through the Spanish keeper’s hands onto the cross-bar, only to fall harmlessly in front of him for a save. </p>
<p>Two more dropped points means that United remain in 5th place, and after Manchester City and Arsenal drew 2:2 at the Emirates on Sunday afternoon, that means United are two points ahead of the Gunners and five points behind City in the table. All in all, United have drawn 11 matches this season, eight of which were at home, meaning that United have dropped 22 out of a possible 33 of those points in winnable matches. More worryingly, United have a congested- and difficult- schedule ahead of them, in comparison to Liverpool, who play only mid-to lower-table sides for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>United host Everton on Tuesday evening in a match that is surely a must-win. Everton fell to Liverpool at the weekend but remain only three points adrift of United in 7th on 50 points. Anything short of a win would surely mean that United’s hopes of a top-four finish are all but over. However, Zlatan and Ander Herrera are eligible for selection and Pogba could be available as well, having trained with the squad at Old Trafford after the match on Saturday. United then travel to Sunderland to face the bottom-placed side on Sunday 09 April before heading to Belgium to face Anderlecht in the Europa League the following Thursday. Here’s United’s schedule for the remainder of April:</p>
<p>04 APR: Everton, Premier League, 20:00 BST (H) 09 APR: Sunderland, Premier League, 13:30 BST (A) 13 APR: Anderlecht, Europa League quarter-final first leg, 20:05 BST (A) 16 APR: Chelsea, Premier League, 16:00 BST (H) 20 APR: Anderlecht, Europa League quarter-final second leg, 20:05 BST (H) 23 APR: Burnley, Premier League, 14:15 BST (A) 27 APR: Manchester City, Premier League, 20:00 BST (A) 30 APR: Swansea City, Premier League, 12:00 BST (H)</p>
<p>If Manchester United are to land Champions League football next season, their domestic form will have to improve and they must win all of their matches in the Europa League, of which they are strong favourites to win. </p>
<p>Check back next Monday for reaction to the matches against Everton and Sunderland and a look ahead at Anderlecht and Chelsea in the week that follows. </p>

<p>April 1 (Reuters) - Top-seeded teams Gonzaga and North Carolina prevailed in a pair of thrilling finishes on Saturday to advance to the final of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.</p>
<p>Gonzaga squandered a 14-point, second-half lead before holding on to edge South Carolina 77-73, while North Carolina grabbed an offensive rebound after missing two free throws in the final seconds to beat Oregon 77-76.</p>
<p>Gonzaga advanced to their first NCAA tournament final, which will be held on Monday, while North Carolina are trying to make amends for losing last year’s championship on a buzz-beater by Villanova.</p>
<p>“It’s a dream to get (to the championship),” North Carolina coach Roy Williams told reporters.</p>
<p>“Now we’ve got to play better but (Gonzaga) has been fantastic all year long. They only lost one game. It’s hard to imagine.”</p>
<p>North Carolina senior Kennedy Meeks delivered 25 points and 14 rebounds, including the final one that preserved their lead, as the Tar Heels held off an Oregon fightback from seven points down with just over three minutes remaining.</p>
<p>“Oregon did a great job of fighting back, Meeks said. “It’s a great opportunity (to get back to the final). As long as we stick together I think we’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>In the earlier game, Gonzaga was led by point guard Nigel Williams-Goss who finished with 23 points, five rebounds and six assists. South Carolina had a chance to tie the game while trailling 75-72 and taking possession with 12.7 seconds left but they did not get a shot away and following Gonzaga coach Mark Few’s instructions, guard Josh Perkins committed a foul with 3.5 seconds remaining, sending Sindarius Thornwell to the line.</p>
<p>Thornwell made one to bring the score to 75-73 before Gonzaga’s Killian Tillie grabbed the defensive rebound and was fouled. Tillie made two free throws with two seconds remaining to ensure victory.</p>
<p>“Man, just an awesome, awesome basketball game, with just how hard both teams competed,” Gonzaga’s Few said.</p>
<p>“I mean, that run South Carolina made on us, that just shows the heart of a lion that they have. It took everything we had to hold them off and come back.” (Writing by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles; Editing by Greg Stutchbury)</p>

<p>Baseball Doesn’t Understand the Cause of Domestic Violence</p>
<p>New York Mets pitcher Jeurys Familia was arrested last Halloween for assaulting his wife. Undoubtedly under enormous pressure, his wife convinced the prosecutor to drop the charges. Domestic violence crimes are often difficult to prove beyond a reasonable doubt without the testimony of the victim, particularly if a thorough evidence-based investigation was not made at the time of the crime.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball’s policy is clear that the lack of a conviction does not preclude punishment for domestic violence and the league does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Familia’s wife had visible injuries which is why the criminal charges were brought in the first place. After a long investigation, Commissioner Manfred announced that Familia would receive a suspension of only 15 days which is far less than other recent offenders received.</p>
<p>Baseball was quite properly criticized for the short suspension, long time taken to investigate and the failure to clearly explain his offense. Far more troubling is that in announcing its response to Familia’s assault, the baseball authorities demonstrated they are clueless in understanding the cause of domestic violence.</p>
<p>The Commissioner emphasized that Familia had voluntarily attended counseling sessions with someone who claimed to specialize in domestic violence. This was treated as if it was a mitigating factor. In reality, abusers often participate in ineffective programs in order to convince their partners or the judges that they have changed. In this case it was the Commissioner he was manipulating.</p>
<p>The idea that domestic violence is caused by mental health issues is a misconception that developed in the 1970s when no research was available. The research has been clear for decades that domestic violence is not caused by mental illness. Abusers who also have mental health problems have less inhibitions so their abuse may be more severe, but the illness is not the cause. Only accountability and monitoring have been shown to change abusers’ behavior, but the ignorance of this fundamental information led the commissioner to minimize the accountability Familia would receive.</p>
<p>Authorities Must Learn the Cause of Domestic Violence</p>
<p>Major League Baseball purportedly made a major effort to improve its response to domestic violence in response to the series of domestic violence and child abuse cases mishandled by the NFL. Baseball cannot play its role in preventing domestic violence, however, if it does not even understand the cause of domestic violence. I understand the leaders of major league baseball cannot be expected to be experts in domestic violence and might not know to ask an expert if the therapeutic sessions would be beneficial. They could, however explain the circumstances and their proposed response and seek feedback from a DV expert before making a mockery of their promise to take domestic violence seriously.</p>
<p>In fairness, Baseball is far from alone in failing to understand the causes of domestic violence. Many criminal courts routinely respond to domestic violence crimes with ineffective practices like therapy, anger management and leniency. Custody courts regularly assume the end of the relationship also ends the danger. They fail to consider that the victim did not cause his abuse and he will likely abuse future partners. This is critical because it means the children will be exposed to further abuse unless he is stopped.</p>
<p>There is a long history of society allowing and even encouraging husbands to control; assault and discipline their wives. The first law in the United States concerning what we now call domestic violence said husbands cannot beat their wives―-ON SUNDAY. In other words any other day men’s assaults on their wives were acceptable. Although the laws have changed the old beliefs are widespread. It is all too common for men today to believe they are better than their partners; they are entitled to make the decisions in the relationship and have the privilege of enforcing their rules.</p>
<p>In one of the batterer classes I teach, a man proudly said he was a wonderful husband because he let his wife pick out the furniture. I pointed out that his assumption was that because he was the man he was entitled to make the decisions but allowed her to make this one decision. He said I misunderstood what he said and tried to rephrase his statement. The other men in the class started to laugh as he really repeated the same thing and eventually he joined in. These are the kind of unconscious assumptions that lead men to enforce their “rights and privileges.”</p>
<p>We cannot prevent domestic violence without understanding the cause. More than the ignorant statements of a baseball commissioner, it disturbs me that the media did not respond by correcting his misinformation. The year is now 2017. We cannot continue to accept the myth that domestic violence is caused by mental illness.</p>

<p>North Carolina missed four free throws in the final seconds but came up with two key offensive rebounds to help hold back Oregon 77-76 before 77, 612 fans in the Final Four at University of Phoenix Stadium. Kennedy Meeks led the effort for the Tar Heels, playing perhaps the best game of his career, with 25 points and 14 rebounds. Justin Jackson was also effective for UNC scoring 22 points and connecting on four three-pointers. Tyler Dorsey led Oregon with 21 points, his eighth straight post-season game with over 20 points.</p>
<p>North Carolina won the game despite off games offensively from Joel Berry II (2-of-14), Isaiah Hicks (1-of-12) and Theo Pinson (2-of-8). Pinson made his impact on the defensive end, using his length to bottle up Oregon’s Dillon Brooks. Brooks, the Pac-12 Player of the Year, didn’t have his best tournament and was bothered by Pinson’s length. Brooks never could get it going, shooting 2-of-11 from the field in scoring 10 points and fouled out with 1:32 remaining. In the final minute, Oregon trailed 77-71 when Dorsey hit a three-pointer with 45 seconds left to cut the lead the three. After a Pinson miss with 18 seconds left, Keith Smith scored on a lay-up to cut the Tar Heel lead to 77-76. That set the stage for two missed free throws by Meeks. Then after another foul, Berry missed his two charity shots before Meeks pulled down his eighth offensive board of the night to seal the game for the Tar Heels.</p>
<p>Both teams had trouble getting into their offense in the first half until Oregon, helped by two three-pointers from Dylan Ennis (18 points) ran out to a 30-22 lead. North Carolina came back from there, taking a 39-36 halftime lead. They extended their run at the start of the second half and brought their lead to eight points (46-38) on a three-pointer from Jackson. It was a 26-8 run by the Tar Heels which put them in control of the game until the Ducks made their late surge.</p>
<p>Oregon was surprisingly loose with the ball in the first half, committing 12 turnovers, with four from Brooks. They ended the contest with 16 turnovers against only seven assists, usually a recipe for disaster. But they fought hard defensively and Jordan Bell did his job on the boards (16 rebounds and 13 points). While the Ducks couldn’t grab those last second rebounds they battled the bigger Tar Heels evenly off the glass (43 rebounds each) although the Tar Heels had a +5 edge on the offensive glass. Oregon also shot poorly from distance (7-of-26) and stayed in the game at the foul line (25-of-28) with Dorsey making all 12 of his attempts.</p>
<p>At the end, the game could have gone either way. A team needs a little luck and key plays to win close games and advance in the tournament. Oregon got that in wins against Rhode Island and Michigan but couldn’t pull it off against North Carolina. The Tar Heels advance to play Gonzaga, each a No. 1 seed, in a highly anticipated championship game on Monday night.</p>
<p>In the first game, Nigel Williams-Goss scored 23 points and added six assists and five rebounds to lead Gonzaga (37-1) to a hard-fought 77-73 win over a gritty South Carolina (26-11) squad. 7-0 freshman Zach Collins may have been the key for the Zags, contributing 14 points, 13 rebounds and six blocked shots in 23 minutes off the bench. 6-6 sophomore guard PJ Dozier led the Gamecocks with 17 points and added nine rebounds.</p>
<p>Gonzaga came out shooting very well, hitting 5-of-9 first half three-pointers and 58 percent from the field in moving out to a 45-36 halftime lead. SEC Player of the Year Sindarius Thornwell was off in the half only shooting 1-of-5. The Gamecocks extended their defense in the second half and were more aggressive on the boards. Gonzaga had a 14-point lead with 10:55 remaining when South Carolina came storming back, scoring the next 16 points to take a 67-65 lead.</p>
<p>Collins answered with a three-pointer and Przemek Karnowski (13 points) followed with a dunk and lay-up to give Gonzaga a 72-67 lead that they would not relinquish. South Carolina had chances to tie the game in the final two minutes but Rakym Felder missed a jumper with 1:37 remaining and Dozier came up empty on a three-pointer with 1:12 left. French freshman, 6-10 Killian Tillie hit two free throws, his only points of the game, with two seconds left to give the Zags their four-point winning margin.</p>
<p>Helped by Collins’ strong board work Gonzaga ended the game with a +5 rebounding margin. South Carolina cut that margin in the second half as Chris Silva (13 points) finished with 13 rebounds. Thornwell (15 points) shot an inefficient 4-of-12. Gonzaga hit just under 50 percent (29-of-60) for the game while hitting 9-of-19 three-pointers. Gonzaga advances to the championship game for the first time in program history.</p>

Dak Prescott Or Morgan William?" date="2017-04-02" authors="Jen Fry, ContributorLet's talk about the topics you aren't supposed to talk about ...">
<p>Yesterday, March 31st, Morgan William truly made history within not only collegiate women’s basketball, collegiate women’s sports, or collegiate basketball in general. She made history within sports, period. With seconds left on the clock, Morgan William of Mississippi State got the ball from a teammate, drove in, and shot a jumper to put Mississippi State up 66-64 over the Goliath and current National Champion UConn. She made the winning shot to beat a team who had an 111-game, three-year win streak. She did the unthinkable. Beat UConn. However, when Morgan was interviewed by Holly Rowe of ESPN she was interviewed WITH Dak Prescott, the current Dallas Cowboys quarterback. Wait, what? A woman made a historical shot to beat a team on an 111-game streak yet she wasn’t the only one being interviewed ― Dak Prescott was with her. Well actually, to be correct, she was with Dak Prescott.</p>
<p>Both Morgan William and Dak Prescott were being interviewed, but Morgan wasn’t being asked questions about her performance. Dak Prescott was being asked about her performance, what he thought about it, how it made him feel. “How does it makes you feel knowing you have him, with all that he has accomplished, having your back motivate you?” was the first question Holly asked Morgan, after asking Dak two questions. “Why does he believe in you so much?” was her next question. So far Holly has asked four questions, two to Dak and two to Morgan about Dak. Hopefully, Holly would have realized her mistake and started asking Morgan about how she felt, as she shot the game-winner. Nope. Back to Dak, asking him about “how his bulldogs get it done.” Ok, now maybe she will talk to the athlete who made the winning shot about how she felt... Maybe, hopefully... Nope. Back to Dak and asking him if he would be attending the national championship game.</p>
<p>When has a male collegiate team performed a historical event and a celebrity or famous female athlete was brought down in to be interviewed instead of the male who performed the feat? When have the views of a person watching the event been more important than the person actually involved in the event? NEVER. NEVER. EVER. Holly Rowe of ESPN showed exactly what society thinks of female sports. The views of the males watching the sports are more important than the women actually playing. We saw throughout the Olympics, male coaches given the kudos for their female athletes’ performance. We saw how much more of an emphasis the media put on Hungarian swimmer Katinka Hoozu’s husband, who is also her coach, than they did on Katinka Hoozu’s performances. The media’s words gave the assumption that the male coaches were the sole reason for the female swimmer’s successes.</p>
<p>However, in sexism, interviewing Dak Prescott AND Morgan William takes the cake. A woman makes a historical shot and she is of less importance than a male watching the game. Can we stop now? Can we stop pretending this doesn’t consistently happen? Can people actually start to acknowledge the downright sexism that occurs within women’s sports? I don’t know about you, but I am tired of it. I want to enjoy Morgan William’s interview and listen to her re-live probably what will be the best moment of her athletic and collegiate career. I do not want to hear a man, who only watched from the stands re-live it for her. Holly Rowe, you need to do better. You need to do better as a female interviewer interviewing another female, and you need to do better for that young lady because you just showed her and others like her that her performance doesn’t matter, what matters is the man’s view who watched it.</p>

<p>They started as underdogs, but proved they’re truly Bulldogs. </p>
<p>A 111-game winning streak was finally dismantled Saturday night when Mississippi State’s women’s Bulldogs beat the University of Connecticut Huskies on an epic buzzer-beater. </p>
<p>MSU won 66-64, knocking the Huskies out of the NCAA tournament as the Bulldogs advance to the women’s championship game.</p>
<p>With only seconds left in overtime, point guard Morgan Williams fired a shot into the basket right as the buzzer sounded. The 5-foot-5 inch point guard was immediately tackled by her teammates in a Bulldog dog pile. </p>
<p>“I was in shock; I’m still in shock,” William said at a postgame news conference, according to The New York Times. “I’m over here like, dang, I just won the game.” </p>
<p>As an added bonus, here’s MSU’s Baseball team watching the last few seconds of the game. </p>
<p>And here it is again, this time set to the “Titanic” theme. Congratulations, Bulldogs. </p>

<p>You don’t need to be a baseball fan to appreciate this moment.</p>
<p>Brock Stassi learned Thursday that he made the opening day roster for the Philadelphia Phillies. For a guy who was a 33rd round draft pick and toiled for six years in the minor leagues, this was overwhelming news.</p>
<p>Here’s a touching clip where he thanked a scout who “saw something in me and I’m just so thankful.”</p>
<p>Stassi, a 27-year-old first baseman and outfielder, earned the promotion. He has hit .333 (19 for 57) with six homers and 17 RBIs in spring training.</p>
<p>According to CSN Philly, manager Pete Mackanin broke the news by asking Stassi, “What number do you want?”</p>
<p>Stassi will be suited up when the Phillies visit Cincinnati for their season opener on Monday.</p>
<p>Stassi’s younger brother, Max, a catcher for the Houston Astros, gave his sibling a shoutout on Twitter for overcoming the odds.</p>

<p>The term “RBI” had a new definition during a Spring Training game between the Colorado Rockies and San Diego Padres: “Rogue Bee Invasion.”</p>
<p>During the 9th inning of Thursday’s game in Peoria, Arizona, a swarm of bees gathered on a microphone behind home plate and started buzzing around the infield, according to KDVR.</p>
<p>The pitcher, catcher, hitter and ump immediately hit the deck, lying on their stomachs to avoid being stung.</p>
<p>“It’s like a nuclear bomb drill,” Fox San Diego sportscaster Mark Grant said in the clip below.</p>
<p>Padres pitcher Clayton Richard was asked about the bees during an interview with MLB.com. He’s not a professional entomologist by any means, but his advice on how to deal with them hit a home run in terms of logic.</p>
<p>“You get away from them,” he said. “Get on the other side of the dugout. I don’t want to be anywhere near that.”</p>
<p>The swarm was only a temporary problem ― for the Rockies, anyway. They beat the Padres 10-5.</p>

<p>From the nation’s capital to the global capital of gambling, advocates for the legalization of sports betting celebrated the NFL’s decision this week to allow the Oakland Raiders to relocate to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“We congratulate the Raiders and the National Football League on today’s historic decision to place a team in Las Vegas,” Geoff Freeman, the president and chief executive officer of the American Gaming Association, which supports the legalization of sports gambling, said in a statement Monday.</p>
<p>The Raiders’ relocation, Freeman said, “demonstrates how far gaming has come.”</p>
<p>Sports gambling has been effectively outlawed in the United States since 1992, when Congress enacted the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or PASPA, a federal law that allows sports betting in just four states, including Nevada, the only one permitted to operate full sports books.</p>
<p>For that reason, it seemed impossible that Las Vegas could ever be home to a professional sports franchise as recently as a decade ago, as the NBA, the NFL, the NHL and Major League Baseball ― which combined to provide the force PASPA needed to become law ― remained staunchly opposed to gambling and viewed the idea of holding sporting events next door to sports books as a threat to the integrity of their games.</p>
<p>That unified opposition began to crack in recent years. In 2014, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver called for the legalization and regulation of sports wagering nationwide. Last month, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said his league is re-evaluating its position on legal gambling.</p>
<p>Now, Sin City will be home to franchises in the other two major leagues, as the Raiders will join the National Hockey League’s Vegas Golden Knights, an expansion franchise that will begin play next season.</p>
<p>Gambling advocates and gaming law experts see the NFL’s decision to join the NHL in Vegas as a potentially significant moment for sports gambling ― one that highlights the broader acceptance of the practice and could provide momentum for the growing movement to legalize and regulate it.</p>
<p>“It’s a pretty big symbolic breakthrough,” said I. Nelson Rose, a professor at Whittier Law School and gaming law expert who has advised governments and the industry. “The sports leagues used to be unified against anything that could conceivably lead to betting on sports.”</p>
<p>The question is whether that symbolism is powerful enough to help pave the way for legalization. </p>
<p>In Washington, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.) hopes it will. Pallone, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees regulatory issues in sports, introduced legislation last year to roll back PASPA and called on the NFL to join him in the effort after Monday’s vote.</p>
<p>“This move is a clear sign that the league owners’ attitudes toward sports betting has changed,” Pallone said in a statement. “I hope that following today’s vote, I can count on the support of the NFL and the NFL team owners for my efforts to legalize and regulate sports betting.”</p>
<p>He may have to wait awhile for a friendly response.</p>
<p>Even before NFL owners voted on the move, Commissioner Roger Goodell attempted to quash the idea that the Raiders’ relocation plans marked a change in how his league sees gambling.</p>
<p>“We are not changing our position as it relates to legalized sports gambling,” Goodell told The MMQB. “We still don’t think it is a positive thing.”</p>
<p>New Jersey state Sen. Ray Lesniak (D), though, doesn’t need the NFL’s help advancing legislation in Congress.</p>
<p>In 2012, Lesniak led the push to legalize sports gambling at New Jersey’s casinos and racetracks. All four major leagues and the NCAA immediately challenged the law that he sponsored and that Republican Gov. Chris Christie signed. The leagues argued it violated PASPA, and the law was defeated in federal court.</p>
<p>When New Jersey took another crack at it in 2014, the leagues won in court again. The state is now appealing its case to the Supreme Court, and in January the court asked the U.S. solicitor general to weigh in on the fight, an unexpected development considering most legal observers thought justices would decline to hear the case (which they may still do).</p>
<p> Lesniak, who is now seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, sees the Raiders’ move to Las Vegas as a boost for the state’s case. The government has traditionally supported the four sports leagues’ position on PASPA, but Lesniak said Monday that he was preparing a letter to the solicitor general’s office to argue that having a team in Las Vegas helps invalidate its core opposition to legal gambling. </p>
<p>“It’s very, very, very difficult now to argue that legalized sports betting undermines the integrity of the game,” Lesniak told The Huffington Post.</p>
<p>To Lesniak, the NFL’s actions on gambling render its words on the subject almost meaningless. He points to other embraces of gambling that, at this point, make the NFL’s public opposition border on hypocrisy. The NFL has benefited from gambling, it knows it has benefited from gambling and everyone else knows it has benefited from gambling.</p>
<p>The league eagerly embraced fantasy football as a way to help drive interest in its sport ― and while fantasy sports aren’t considered gambling under federal law, that’s because of the NFL, which lobbied Congress for a “carve out” in gaming laws that kept them separate from traditional gambling, and thus legal.</p>
<p>The NFL has a similarly symbiotic relationship with daily fantasy sports, which have further blurred the lines between fantasy games and actual sports gambling. At least 28 NFL teams have partnered with daily fantasy companies, and the league didn’t back away from the industry even as its murky legal status came under scrutiny in states and in Congress last year (the league claims it does not view daily fantasy games as gambling).</p>
<p>In 2012, the NFL lifted its ban on casino advertisements in stadiums. Five years prior, it began playing annual games in London, where sports gambling is legal. It expanded its London schedule to four games last season and has invested in a stadium there to host future games. NFL owners publicly share their desires to have a franchise in London sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>A team in Vegas “is the final straw” in the NFL’s argument that gambling poses a threat to its game, Lesniak said.</p>
<p>Rose believes it’s “too late” to save the New Jersey case. But, the law professor said, New Jersey’s fight could embolden efforts to legalize sports wagering at the state level: Pennsylvania, Maryland and Michigan are already considering such legislation.</p>
<p>If those become law, they will likely run into challenges under PASPA, too. But added to its past moves toward gambling, the NFL’s entrance into Las Vegas could make it hard for the league to clearly articulate to a court why exactly it opposes legalized sports betting, said Daniel Wallach, a Florida-based attorney and gaming law expert, especially given its earlier embraces of gaming.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be more difficult for the leagues to continue to argue in court that sports betting undermines their games,” Wallach said. “They can no longer claim that they would be irreparably harmed by betting on sporting events when they are participating in that activity and are directly involved in supporting it.”</p>
<p>“The next time a state tries to legalize sports betting,” Wallach said, it will have “an even more powerful argument concerning the leagues’ hypocrisy than New Jersey ever possessed.”</p>
<p>Aside from legal fights and legislative battles, the presence of major professional sports in Las Vegas for the first time should go a long way toward showing leagues like the NFL that legalized and regulated gambling serves them better than the alternative, said Jennifer Roberts, the associate director of the International Center for Gaming Regulation at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“It will highlight how highly regulated our environment for sports wagering is, that it’s able to maintain the integrity of the sport, and provide for responsible gaming and consumer protections,” Roberts told HuffPost. “Sports wagering is going to happen. So it’s better to happen in a regulated environment.”</p>
<p>Goodell hinted at that in a Tuesday press conference, saying that the league likely won’t try to keep Vegas sports books from taking bets on Raiders games, “in large part because you have the regulatory environment there, which actually could be beneficial in this case.”</p>
<p>The federal prohibition on sports gambling, Roberts noted, hasn’t stopped the practice from flourishing. Though exact figures are impossible to come by, Americans illegally wager an estimated $80 billion to $380 billion a year on sporting events.</p>
<p>  That’s a huge potential market ― one the league will now see up close every Sunday ― and nothing changes the NFL’s opinion on any given subject like cash. The allure of money is how the NFL got in bed with daily fantasy sports companies and what ultimately landed the Raiders in Vegas. And in the end, it might be what finally convinces Goodell to complete the NFL’s shift on gambling, too.  </p>

<p>It was almost inevitable.</p>
<p>A San Diego organization that’s hoping to bring Major League Soccer to the city asked fans to vote on a possible team name ― and Footy McFooty Face emerged as the overwhelming favorite.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday morning, more than 8,000 people supported the name ― that’s 6,000 more votes than for the second place name, San Diego Surf.</p>
<p>The effort is part of FS Investors’ bid to turn San Diego’s Qualcomm Stadium into a future home of an MLS expansion team, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. The project, known around town as SoccerCity, would also be a place for offices, retail and entertainment.</p>
<p>The contest for a future soccer team name first sought submissions from fans, and then let vote people vote online. Judging from the 2016 incident in which internet users voted to name the United Kingdom’s new polar research ship “Boaty McBoatface,” it’s not that surprising that “Footy McFooty Face” is the fan favorite. </p>
<p>U.K. officials decided to name the ship after world-renowned naturalist Sir David Attenborough, though they named one of its sub-sea remotely operated vehicles in honor of the people’s choice.</p>
<p>While it’s entirely possible that Footy McFooty Face will miss out on soccer team name honors, NPR suggested incorporating the name into the potential side’s mascot. </p>

</doc><doc id="643" filename="SPORTS" url="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-womens-hockey-pay-deal_us_58d13577e4b00705db52b7fa" headline="U.S. Women's Hockey Players Reach Deal To End Fair Pay Boycott" date="2017-03-29" authors="Travis Waldron">
<p>The U.S. women’s national hockey team has ended a two-week fair pay boycott and will play in the upcoming world championship tournament, after their lawyers reached an agreement Tuesday with the sport’s governing body.</p>
<p>USA Hockey, the sport’s American federation, and the U.S. women’s team announced in a joint press release that they had reached an agreement “that will result in groundbreaking support for the U.S. Women’s National Team program over the course of the next four years.”</p>
<p>“Today reflects everyone coming together and compromising in order to reach a resolution for the betterment of the sport,” said Jim Smith, president of USA Hockey. “We’ll now move forward together knowing we’ll look back on this day as one of the most positive in the history of USA Hockey.”</p>
<p>The two sides agreed to keep financial terms of the deal private. But the deal includes the formation of a new advisory group made up of current and former players that will “assist USA Hockey in efforts to advance girls’ and women’s hockey,” the release said.</p>
<p>“Our sport is the big winner today,” said Meghan Duggan, the team’s captain. “We stood up for what we thought was right and USA Hockey’s leadership listened. In the end, both sides came together.”</p>
<p>The agreement means the U.S. women’s team will return to the ice for the International Ice Hockey Federation World Championship, which begins in Plymouth, Michigan, on March 31.</p>
<p>More than a year of private negotiations between the players and USA Hockey over compensation and other forms of financial support exploded into a public battle on March 15, when the USWNT threatened to skip the International Ice Hockey Federation Women’s World Championship unless they made “significant progress” in talks with the federation. The dispute threatened to leave the tournament without its host and defending champion.</p>
<p>The United States won the tournament’s gold medal in 2016, and has won six of the last eight world championship gold medals overall.</p>
<p>The boycott centered on a lack of financial support for the women’s team. The players wanted better compensation from the federation, which they said only provided small monthly stipends during a six-month Olympic training period ― but otherwise did not pay the players during the other 3 1/2 years of each Olympic cycle. They also pointed to insufficient support for travel and marketing, and what they saw as USA Hockey’s disparate support for men’s and women’s hockey at the development level: While USA Hockey spends $3.5 million annually on its national team program for boys, they said, girls receive no “comparable” support.</p>
<p>USA Hockey disputed those claims, and initially began seeking out replacement players to field a team in the tournament. </p>
<p>The boycott appeared near its end last Monday, when USA Hockey officials met with nine players and the team’s attorneys in Philadelphia. More than 10 hours of “productive” meetings left players feeling hopeful that a deal was close.</p>
<p>But the talks collapsed later in the week, and USA Hockey again extended invites to other players in hopes of placing a team of replacements in the world championship. Women’s players at the collegiate, high school and even recreational level, however, remained committed to the national team’s cause, publicly posting on Twitter that they had declined the federation’s invites. </p>
<p>Members of the women’s team said all along that they hoped to reach a deal that would allow them to return to the ice in time for the world championships.</p>
<p> “We want to play,” Duggan told The Huffington Post the day the boycott began. “We want this to get resolved. We want to come to an agreement that USA Hockey and ourselves can both be on board with.” As of last Friday, players were willing to “show up the day before the game if we have to,” USWNT forward Monique Lamoureux told HuffPost. That, in effect, is what they will do. The U.S. will hold its first practice Thursday night, one day before they begin the tournament against Canada. USA Hockey’s board met for several hours Monday night, once again fueling hopes that a deal was near. But the evening ended without a resolution. USA Hockey sent a new proposal to the players Tuesday morning, and players voted to ratify the agreement after hours of negotiation over unspecified terms in the deal.  In the end, the agreement highlighted the power of the women’s commitment to the boycott, and its ability to stretch beyond their sport. Members of the U.S. women’s soccer team, who have battled their own federation over equal pay issues, stood behind the hockey team almost immediately. Support for their fight eventually spread across the sports world. Unions representing Major League Baseball, NBA, NFL and NHL players all backed the women’s hockey team. WNBA and women’s college basketball players tweeted in favor of them; and members of the men’s national hockey team reportedly threatened to join them in boycotting the world championship.  On Monday, 16 members of the U.S. Senate sent a letter to USA Hockey’s executive director backing the players and urging a quick end to the dispute.  The deal, which will extend beyond the 2018 Winter Olympics, affirmed the larger cause Duggan and the players said they had committed to when the boycott began. “It’s bigger than hockey,” Duggan said that day. “It’s bigger than any one sport or individual. It’s about equitable support for females in this country. This is a difficult thing for us, but we’re united and proud and happy to do it.” </p>

<p>“I tell all the guys: The NFL stands for ‘Not For Long,’” says defensive end Ricky Jean Francois, who recently signed with the Green Bay Packers.</p>
<p>Jean Francois wasn’t supposed to be an exception to that rule. A seventh-round draft pick of the San Francisco 49ers in 2009, Jean Francois ― now on his fourth contract with his fourth team ― just completed his seventh season.</p>
<p>Sustaining a career in the NFL is not easy. The average career lasts just over 3 years, the lowest of any of the four main sports in the U.S., and that includes practice squad players who never even play in a game. Also, NFL contracts are not guaranteed, meaning players ― even stars ― can be cut at any time.</p>
<p>Before inking a deal with the Packers, Jean Francois enjoyed two productive seasons with the Washington Redskins, playing in all 32 possible games, seven of which he started, while recording 57 tackles, including 3.5 sacks.</p>
<p>Just how rare is such production from a seventh-round selection?</p>
<p>According to a 2015 study by Forbes, the median of “percentage of games started” by seventh-round picks from the 2010 draft from 2010-2015 is 0 percent. In other words, the mere fact that Jean Francois has become a starter while more than doubling the NFL career average is almost unheard of.</p>
<p>As a result, the tech-obsessed 30-year-old ― who was cut by Washington despite having one more year on his contract ― has a unique perspective when looking ahead to life after pro football. Despite being a star player and winning a national title at college football powerhouse Louisiana State University, he knew the odds of a career weren’t especially high. </p>
<p>Developing his business acumen became a priority for him early on.</p>
<p>“During my rookie season, I spent a lot of money,” he says. “I was like, ‘Do I really want to be this type of guy?’ I didn’t want to just spend money, because you won’t get it back. ... The next year you couldn’t pay me to spend a dime.</p>
<p>“After I signed a contract with the Colts [in 2013], I realized that I needed a retirement plan.” </p>
<p>According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, 78 percent of NFL players go broke within three years of retirement and 15.7 percent file for bankruptcy within 12 years of retirement.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-3, 313-pound Jean Francois ― this year’s proud recipient of the Redskins’ Media Good Guy Award ― did not want to become one of those statistics.</p>
<p>So Jean Francois started to ask around the league ― talking to veterans, coaches and anyone who would offer advice. He started to educate himself, going through an assortment of different business and economic publications. Forbes, Fortune and Bloomberg are his favorites.</p>
<p>With the help of his financial manager, he then purchased a Dunkin’ Donuts location in Georgia. Before long, he owned 25 franchises throughout the South, and he still has plans to expand to Houston. He committed himself to the business in every offseason, understanding the nuances of the business as he would an NFL playbook. At first, it was a grueling process, learning about projections and parsing through spreadsheets. But soon, it became second nature. He still feels a thrill every time one of his stores beats the sales projections.</p>
<p>“It opened up another world I didn’t know existed,” Jean Francois adds. </p>
<p>“I have to be hands-on so I can see everything grow. I gotta learn how to do it myself.”</p>
<p>When challenges ― such as consistency in the product and service ― presented themselves, Jean Francois leaned on his football background and his experience working with a team. But he’s never had a problem with a single employee.</p>
<p>“Football helped me mentally, because I had to get my mind right,” he says.</p>
<p>“Making sure everybody has a positive vibe,” Jean Francois says, is paramount. “I gotta make sure that I set the mindset of people in there to be happy. Teamwork is the most important thing. It can make things work better. In other words, if football is a brotherhood, business is a community.</p>
<p>“[Business] helped me become a better person,” he says. “Business makes you open up as a person, because now you’re more well-rounded. Early on in the NFL, you get influenced by the Rolls-Royces, the Ferraris, the Lambos. The next thing you know, you’re broke and out of the league.”</p>
<p>And while business has made Jean Francois smarter and more focused, it was the birth of his son six months ago that changed his perception of life. </p>
<p>“My son ― when he looks at me, I want to be the right father figure,” Jean Francois says. “He inspires me. I thought I grew up already, but when he came along, I was like, ‘Okay, I really didn’t grow up.’ When I look at him, it all makes sense.”</p>
<p>These days, Jean Francois ― who is of Haitian descent ― sees inspiration everywhere, including in frequent trips to the small Caribbean island nation as a means of giving back to local communities in need.</p>
<p>But the question still remains: What will life after football look like?</p>
<p>His $3 million deal with the Packers is only for the 2017-18 season. Then, he’s not sure where he’s headed, but he does have one big idea, despite lacking any tangible experience within the stock market.</p>
<p>“I’d like start a hedge fund,” Jean Francois says.</p>
<p>Another option, though, is heading back to school.</p>
<p>He wants to earn an Executive MBA in his hometown at the University of Miami, through a new Artists and Athletes program that has drawn rave reviews. Created in 2015 and aimed in large part toward football players, it employs a schedule that allows players to train early in the morning before going to nine hours of classes complemented by late-night study sessions.</p>
<p>To be sure, it’s no easy task, but Jean Francois certainly thinks it can be done. Fellow defensive end Carlos Dunlap for instance, earned Pro Bowl honors for the Cincinnati Bengals this year, while also completing his MBA.</p>
<p>And considering Jean Francois is already acing statistics, why would anyone doubt him?</p>

<p>The U.S. women’s national hockey team’s ongoing boycott of the upcoming women’s world championship gained new supporters on Monday, when 16 members of the U.S. Senate sent a letter to the sport’s American governing body demanding fair treatment for female players.</p>
<p>The boycott began on March 15, when members of the team announced they would not play in the International Ice Hockey Federation Women’s World Championship ― which begins March 31 ― without “significant progress” in negotiations with USA Hockey over fair pay and other forms of financial support.</p>
<p>“We urge you to resolve this dispute quickly to ensure that the USA Women’s National Hockey Team receives equitable resources,” the senators, led by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), wrote in the letter addressed to USA Hockey Executive Director Dave Ogrean. “These elite athletes indeed deserve fairness and respect, and we hope you will be a leader on this issue as women continue to push for equality in athletics.”</p>
<p>Warren was joined by 13 of her colleagues, all Democrats: Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Thomas Carper (D-Del.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Bob Casey (D-Pa.). Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) also signed the letter but were not listed on the original copy. </p>
<p>In launching the boycott, members of the U.S. women’s team said they wanted better compensation from USA Hockey, which provides them with monthly stipends during a six-month Olympic training period, but does not pay them for the other three and a half years of each Olympic cycle. They also said other forms of financial support ― for marketing, travel and youth development, among other things ― pales in comparison to what the federation provides men’s teams.</p>
<p>In their letter, the senators cited the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, a federal law that applies to governing bodies like USA Hockey. Under that law, the senators wrote, USA Hockey is “legally required to provide equitable support and encouragement for participation by women.”</p>
<p>Players and USA Hockey officials met last Monday to resume negotiations, and the players emerged from more than eight hours of meetings confident that they were close to a deal that would allow them to return to the ice for the tournament. But negotiations fell apart later in the week, and USA Hockey resumed its efforts to field a replacement team at the world championship.</p>
<p>Those efforts have been largely unsuccessful, with some collegiate and even high school women’s players posting on Twitter that they have turned down USA Hockey’s requests.</p>
<p>The senators joined a growing list of supporters of the team’s boycott. Members of the U.S. women’s soccer team ― which is battling its own federation over equal pay issues ― spoke out almost immediately, as did former members of the women’s hockey team. The NFL and Major League Baseball players’ unions have also supported the team. Reports emerged Sunday that members of the U.S. men’s hockey team were considering joining the women’s boycott of the world championship.</p>
<p>USA Hockey’s board was scheduled to meet Monday afternoon to vote on a potential deal that could end the boycott.</p>
<p>The women’s team members still want to play in the tournament. On Friday, forward Monique Lamoureux told The Huffington Post that players “will show up the day before the game if we have to” ― as long as they reach a deal with USA Hockey first. </p>
<p>Read the full letter below.</p>
<p> March 27, 2017Dave OgreanExecutive DirectorUSA Hockey 1775 Bob Johnson Drive Colorado Springs, CO 80906 Dear Mr. Ogrean, As Senators committed to gender equity in all realms of American life, we write to express our serious concern with allegations raised by members of the U.S. Women’s National Hockey Team regarding USA Hockey’s inequitable allocation of resources to the women’s hockey program and unjust treatment of national team members. As you know, the women’s team has chosen to boycott the upcoming International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) World Championship games, citing faltering negotiations with USA Hockey regarding equitable pay and resources. Among other issues, the women note that USA Hockey expects female players to “train full time and compete throughout the year,” yet pays them only $6,000 every four years, an amount that would put them far below the poverty line. The women’s team is in the process of negotiating a four-year contract with USA Hockey that includes “appropriate compensation.” As the National Governing Body for ice hockey in the United States, USA Hockey is required by the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act to “develop interest and participation throughout the United States” in ice hockey and “be responsible to the persons and amateur sports organizations it represents.” USA Hockey is also legally required to “provide equitable support and encouragement for participation by women where separate programs for male and female athletes are conducted on a national basis.” We are disturbed by reports from the U.S. Women’s National Hockey Team suggesting that USA Hockey is not providing “equitable support” to female athletes. While USA Hockey provides its male athletes with a “seemingly endless” supply of hockey equipment, for example, female players are often expected to “buy their own.” This “inequitable support for equipment, staff, meals, travel expenses, transportation, and publicity” is apparent at younger levels of the sport as well: while USA Hockey spends $3.5 million to support male youth athletes in its National Team Development Program, there is no parallel development program for women. The U.S. Women’s National Hockey Team has medaled in every Olympics since 1998, when Women’s Hockey was first added as an Olympic Sport. The team has won gold medals at the IIHF World Championships for the past three years in a row. As Megan Duggan, team captain, announced last week, the women’s team has “represented our country with dignity and deserves to be treated with fairness and respect.” We urge you to resolve this dispute quickly to ensure that the USA Women’s National Hockey Team receives equitable resources. These elite athletes indeed deserve fairness and respect, and we hope you will be a leader on this issue as women continue to push for equality in athletics. Sincerely, Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts Patty Murray, WashingtonDianne Feinstein, CailforniaPatrick Leahy, VermontRichard Blumenthal, ConnecticutMaggie Hassan, New HampshireSherrod Brown, OhioEdward J. Markey, MassachusettsThomas Carper, DelawareTammy Baldwin, Wisconsin Robert Menendez, New JerseyMazie K. Hirono, HawaiiCory Booker, New JerseyBob Casey, Pennsylvania  </p>
<p>UPDATE: This article has been updated to reflect that 16 senators had signed the letter to USA Hockey supporting the players’ boycott. Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) also signed the letter but were not listed on the original copy. </p>

<p>Since Chris Boucher went down with a knee injury in the Pac-12 Tournament, Tyler Dorsey and Jordan Bell have stepped up their games to help Oregon get to the Elite Eight. Dorsey and Bell stepped it to another level tonight to lead the Ducks past Kansas 74-60 in the Midwest Regional Finals to send Oregon to their first trip to the Final Four since 1939. And then it wasn’t really a Final Four. They will face the winner of the South Regional final between North Carolina and Kentucky in the national semifinals.</p>
<p>Dorsey led the game with 27 points hitting several key three-pointers, the most important after Kansas cut Oregon’s lead to 66-60 with slightly under two minutes left. That was the icing on the cake as the Jayhawks did not score again. Bell was all over the court, scoring 11 points, grabbing 13 rebounds, blocking eight shots and even getting four assists. On one series Bell got free for a dunk and then sprinted down the court in time to block a shot a the rim. Dillon Brooks added 17 points including a long, key second-half three-pointer and Dylan Ennis added an efficient 12 points on 5-of-8 shooting.</p>
<p>Kansas seemed out of sorts in this game after freshman sensation Josh Jackson picked up his second foul in the first three minutes of action. Coach Dana Altman mixed up Oregon’s defense using a zone press to slow the Jayhawks offense down and mixing in zones and man-to man. Jackson and guard Devonte’ Graham each went scoreless in the first half. All-American guard Frank Mason kept Kansas relatively close with 17 first half points but he couldn’t do it alone. Mason needed 20 shots to score his team-high 21 points and had to take the offense on himself as he received little help from his teammates.</p>
<p>Dorsey’s long three-pointer at the close of the first half gave Oregon a 44-33 halftime lead. They extended the lead to 18 points (55-37) before Kansas made a run to close the deficit to six. Then Oregon scored the final eight points of the game.</p>
<p>Kansas, the favorite playing before a virtual home crowd, was dominant in their first three games winning them by an average of 30 points and scoring at least 90 points in each. Oregon’s defense held them to 60 and their perimeter defense helped Kansas shoot a paltry 5-of-25 from deep. Oregon, helped by Dorsey’s 6-of-10 from distance, shot 11-of-25 from beyond the arc. Oregon had a +4 edge in rebounding but what was more important was Bell’s eight blocks. On many possessions you could see Kansas hesitate in taking the ball inside. Kansas did not have the rim protector that Oregon had and that was a big difference in the game.</p>
<p>Overall Oregon shot 51 percent for the game while holding Kansas to 35 percent shooting. Jackson finished with 10 second half points and grabbed 12 rebounds while Graham only made three free throws while shooting 0-of-7 from the field.</p>
<p>When Boucher went down with his injury most prognosticators assumed Oregon would be eliminated by now. However, the injury created an urgency in the rest of the team, particularly Dorsey and Bell who are now playing at a level far above their performance during the regular season. While the Ducks are down to mainly a six-man rotation they’ve proven that they can beat anyone as long as they can keep Jordan Bell on the floor protecting the basket.</p>
<p>It’s on to Phoenix for the Oregon Ducks.</p>

<p>March 22 (Reuters) - The United States broke through to win their first World Baseball Classic title with an emphatic 8-0 victory over Puerto Rico in Los Angeles on Wednesday behind the stellar pitching of Marcus Stroman and a 13-hit attack.</p>
<p>Puerto Rico came in with a spotless 7-0 record in the 16-team tournament but the Americans (6-2) were not to be denied and the losers finished runners-up for the second straight WBC.</p>
<p>Stroman was sensational, throwing six no-hit innings after yielding six hits in a row in a four-run first inning to Puerto Rico in a 6-5 second-round loss.</p>
<p>After the gold medal ceremony on the field, the 25-year-old Stroman of the Toronto Blue Jays was named Most Valuable Player of the tournament.</p>
<p>“I want to thank every single guy on this team. It’s been a real special experience,” said Stroman. “That’s a great team over there (Puerto Rico). It’s an All-Star lineup, one through nine.”</p>
<p>Stroman faced the minimum 18 batters through six innings with Carlos Beltran the only man to reach, after a walk leading off the second inning. Beltran was erased when Yadier Molina bounced into a double play.</p>
<p>Stroman, who struck out three, had his no-hitter snapped in the seventh when Angel Pagan led off with an opposite field double, and the right-hander exited to a standing ovation from a crowd exceeding 51,000.</p>
<p>“I got a chance to manage for our country, coaches got a chance to coach for our country, the players got to play for our country,” said an emotional Jim Leyland, the U.S. manager.</p>
<p>The U.S. team jumped to a 2-0 lead off starter Seth Lugo in the third inning when Ian Kinsler crushed a two-run homer to left-center.</p>
<p>The Americans doubled their advantage in the fifth on run-scoring singles by Christian Yelich and Andrew McCutchen.</p>
<p>They tacked on three more runs in the seventh, on a two-run single by Brandon Crawford and an RBI-single by Giancarlo Stanton, and McCutchen drove home the last with an infield single in the eighth.</p>
<p>The United States had advanced to their first WBC title game with a 2-1 semi-finals victory over Japan, winners of the first two tournaments.</p>
<p>“I could not be prouder,” said outfielder Adam Jones. “We brought it home for the United States. Tip of our caps to Puerto Rico and everybody else in the tournament, but we did something special.”</p>

<p>An iguana bizarrely interrupted play at the Miami Open tennis tournament on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officials halted the first-round game between Germany’s Tommy Haas and the Czech Republic’s Jiri Vesely for several minutes after the reptile invaded the court and clambered onto an electronic scoreboard.</p>
<p>Haas snapped a selfie with the critter before stewards tried to grab it with a towel. But the animal wriggled free and sprinted across the court, climbing onto a second scoreboard.</p>
<p>As the crowd cheered, officials successfully scooped up the iguana ― who they’ve since named “Iggy” ― and finally removed it from the arena.</p>
<p>Once play resumed, 23-year-old Vesely went on to win the match. Haas, 38, later suggested the animal may have come to see him play his final match at the tournament, since he’s thinking of retiring at the end of the season. </p>
<p>“Maybe the iguana got the note that this is most likely the last time I’m playing here,” he joked.</p>

<p>The NCAA will not hold any of its college sports championship events in North Carolina for at least the next five years if the state’s legislature fails to repeal an anti-transgender law it passed last year, the NCAA said Thursday.</p>
<p>Last year, the NCAA moved seven championship events ― including men’s NCAA Tournament games ― out of North Carolina after the passage of HB2, a law that prohibited localities from enacting laws to protect people from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity and required that students at North Carolina schools use bathrooms matching their gender assignment at birth.</p>
<p>Next week, the NCAA will begin selecting the hosts of championship events that will be held between 2018 and 2022. North Carolina cities have submitted bids for many of those events. But if the state doesn’t repeal HB2 soon, it won’t win hosting rights for any of them.</p>
<p>“Absent any change in the law, our position remains the same regarding hosting current or future events in the state,” the NCAA said in a statement Thursday, citing the need to “assure a safe, healthy, discrimination free atmosphere for all those watching and participating in our events.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers filed legislation to repeal HB2 in the state Senate earlier this week. The repeal bill passed its first procedural hurdle Wednesday. A previous attempt to repeal HB2 after the election of Gov. Roy Cooper (D) ― who ran on his opposition to the law ― failed after a compromise fell apart at the last minute.</p>
<p>Cooper renewed calls for the law’s repeal on Thursday, the one-year anniversary of HB2’s passage. His statement referenced sporting events the state had lost; in addition to NCAA events, the Atlantic Coast Conference relocated its championships from the state, and the NBA moved its 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte to New Orleans.</p>
<p>“Today marks a dark anniversary for our state. For one year now, HB 2 has harmed our reputation and cost our economy thousands of jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars,” Cooper said in a statement. “I have offered numerous compromises and remain open to any deal that will bring jobs and sports back to North Carolina and begin to repair our reputation.”</p>
<p>“North Carolinians have spoken clearly that HB 2 does not reflect our values and must be repealed,” he continued. “Legislative Republicans have been all too happy to use their supermajorities to pass damaging partisan laws. It’s time for them to step up, meet halfway, and repeal HB 2.”</p>
<p>North Carolina’s two most prominent college basketball coaches renewed their previous criticisms of the law during the NCAA Tournament last week, after Duke lost its second-round game to South Carolina. The game would have been played in Greensboro, but the NCAA moved it to Greenville, South Carolina, because of HB2.</p>
<p>“It would be nice if our state got as smart and also would host not just basketball tournaments but concerts and other NCAA events. But maybe we’ll get there in the next century,” Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said after the loss. “Look, it’s a stupid thing. That’s my political statement. If I was president or governor I’d get rid of it.”</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t just be about athletic events,” North Carolina coach Roy Williams said this week. “It should be about what’s right and wrong. And what we have now is wrong.”</p>

<p>President Donald Trump just took a cheap shot at an NFL player who dared to speak his mind.</p>
<p>During a rally in Louisville, Kentucky, on Monday, the commander in chief brought up free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s inability to land a job with a team, according to reports.</p>
<p>Trump once called Kaepernick disrespectful for taking a knee during the national anthem to protest racial injustice before games last season ― a move that polarized the nation. This time, the president referenced a Bleacher Report story in which an unidentified team general manager estimated that 10 percent of teams were reluctant to sign the former 49er over fears Trump would tweet about them.</p>
<p>“There was an article today … that NFL owners don’t want to pick him up because they don’t want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump,” the president said. “Do you believe that?”</p>
<p>“I said, ‘If I remember that one, I’m gonna report it to the people of Kentucky because they like it when people actually stand for the American flag.’”</p>
<p>As of early Tuesday, Kaepernick’s Twitter remained mum on Trump’s comments.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old footballer opted out the final year of his 49ers contract weeks ago and became an unrestricted free agent, ESPN reported.</p>
<p>He will reportedly stand for the anthem next season ― if he signs with a team.</p>

<p>On Monday at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky, President Donald Trump took aim at NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who decided last season not to stand for the national anthem in protest of the mistreatment of people of color in the U.S.</p>
<p>“There was an article today … that NFL owners don’t want to pick [Kaepernick] up because they don’t want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump,” Trump said. “Do you believe that?”</p>
<p>He added, “I said, ‘If I remember that one, I’m gonna report it to the people of Kentucky because they like it when people actually stand for the American flag.’”</p>
<p>Kaepernick responded Tuesday not with his mouth, but with his money. NFL.com’s Ian Rapoport reported earlier today that the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback was donating $50,000 to Meals on Wheels America, which could face reduced federal funding if Trump’s budget were to be approved. (Worth noting: Meals on Wheels only gets a small percentage of its funding from the Community Development Block Grant and other federal programs that Trump has proposed cutting.)</p>
<p>Additionally, Kaepernick announced through Rapoport that he will donate $50,000 to Love Army for Somalia, a social media campaign to send 60 tons of food and water to Somalia to combat famine. </p>
<p>The 29-year-old donated the money despite remaining an unrestricted free agent since he opted out of his contract earlier this month. He has said he plans to stand during the national anthem next season should he get signed. </p>
<p>Meals on Wheels thanked Kaepernick over Twitter on Tuesday for his donation, one of many the organization has received since news of potential budget cuts earned national attention last week. </p>

<p>Former San Francisco 49er Dwight Clark, who was on the receiving end of the play known simply as “The Catch,” has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</p>
<p>Clark made the announcement in a statement posted on Sunday to the website of former 49ers owner Ed DeBartolo Jr. </p>
<p>“In September of 2015, I started feeling weakness in my left hand. I was mildly paying attention to it because since my playing days, I’ve constantly had pain in my neck. I was thinking it was related to some kind of nerve damage because it would just come and go,” Clark wrote.</p>
<p>“After months of tests and treatment, I got some bad news,” he continued. “I was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. I have ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. Those words are still very hard for me to say.”</p>
<p>In recent years, ALS, commonly referred to as Lou Gehrig’s disease, has been linked to the degenerative brain disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, ESPN noted. CTE is found in athletes and other individuals with a history of concussions and other repetitive brain trauma.</p>
<p>Clark addressed questions surrounding the connection between his football career and the diagnosis. </p>
<p>“I’ve been asked if playing football caused this. I don’t know for sure. But I certainly suspect it did,” Clark wrote. “And I encourage the NFLPA and the NFL to continue working together in their efforts to make the game of football safer, especially as it relates to head trauma.”</p>
<p>Clark is perhaps best known for being the receiver in the play football fans simply call “The Catch.” The six-yard touchdown pass thrown by Joe Montana lifted the 49ers to victory over the Dallas Cowboys in the 1982 NFC Championship game.</p>
<p>The San Francisco 49ers CEO Jed York released the following statement regarding Clark’s announcement: </p>

<p>The FBI and NFL security have recovered the jersey that was stolen from Tom Brady following the Patriots’ historic comeback in this year’s Super Bowl.</p>
<p>“The items were found in the possession of a credentialed member of the international media,” the league said in a statement.</p>
<p>In addition to the Super Bowl LI uniform, the investigation also led to the recovery of Brady’s missing Super Bowl XLIX jersey, which he wore against the Seattle Seahawks in 2015.</p>
<p>The uniforms were recovered in Mexico with the assistance of Mexican authorities, Houston Police Department Chief Art Acevedo said.</p>
<p>A report by Houston Police assigned a value of $500,000 to the jersey, ESPN reported.</p>
<p>At the time that the uniform went missing, Patriots owner Robert Kraft told his star quarterback that he “better look online.”</p>

<p>A Ghanaian soccer star may be in the doghouse after giving an awkward live TV interview where he mistakenly thanked his wife and girlfriend.</p>
<p>Mohammed Anas, who plays for South Africa’s Free State Stars, had just been named “man of the match” when he made the Freudian slip of the tongue during a post-game interview Friday night.</p>
<p>“Firstly I appreciate my fans,” Mohammed Anas began, “and my wife and my girlfriend.”</p>
<p>Within seconds of catching his mistake, he quickly backtracked with some nervous-sounding laughter.</p>
<p>“I mean my wife, sorry for saying, I’m so sorry, my wife,” he said. “I love you so much. I love you so much from my heart.”</p>
<p>The 22-year-old scored twice during the South African Premier Division game, the Telegraph reported. But his gaffe left internet users wondering what may have been going on off field.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping the “man of the game” is still “man of the house”?</p>

<p>USA Gymnastics President Steve Penny resigned Thursday amid claims the organization responded too slowly to sexual abuse allegations, roughly a week after U.S. Olympic Committee officials reportedly called for his ouster. </p>
<p>“The board believes this change in leadership will help USA Gymnastics face its current challenges and implement solutions to move the organization onward in promoting a safe environment or its athletes at all levels,” Paul Parilla, USA Gymnastics chairman, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Penny was named president of USA Gymnastics, the sport’s Indianapolis-based national governing body, in 2005 after joining the organization in 1999. Under his leadership, dozens of athletes have accused the organization of mishandling complaints related to sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Penny said he quit “solely to support the best interests of USA Gymnastics at this time.”</p>
<p>“We all care deeply about the safety of our athletes, which is fundamental to a rewarding experience at any level of gymnastics,” Penny said in a statement. “It has been heartbreaking to learn of instances of abuse and it sickens me that young athletes would be exploited in such a manner.” </p>
<p>Parilla will lead the organization while it searches for a new CEO.</p>
<p>Penny’s ouster follows an Indianapolis Star report in December that revealed 350 gymnasts had alleged abuse in gyms over two decades, and that top USA Gymnastics officials mishandled complaints and allowed accused coaches to move from gym to gym.</p>
<p>Penny, 53, has denied any wrongdoing, although he has acknowledged he was personally responsible for handling the complaints.</p>
<p>U.S. Olympic Committee Chairman Larry Probst said in a one-sentence statement that Penny’s departure “will hopefully allow USA Gymnastics to shift its attention to the future with a secure environment for its athletes and continued success in competition.”</p>
<p>The Olympic Committee couldn’t dictate Penny’s firing, but could have cut roughly $2 million in annual funding to USA Gymnastics, according to The Associated Press. Penny had the backing of USA Gymnastics’ board until the USOC demanded his ouster, AP reported.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, former rhythmic gymnastics champion Jessica Howard wrote an essay in The New York Times condemning USA Gymnastics for what she called a “crippling” tolerance of abuse, which she experienced nearly 18 years ago.</p>
<p>“The institutional tolerance of abusive training and the penchant of USA Gymnastics to look away create a culture conducive to sexual abuse ― for gymnasts of all skill levels,” wrote Howard, the U.S. champion of rhythmic gymnastics from 1999 to 2001.</p>
<p> Howard, a Florida native, alleged she was 15 when the national team’s doctor, Larry Nassar, sexually abused her.   Nassar was arrested in December on federal child pornography charges and was accused last month of 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. He has pleaded not guilty. Officials say more than 80 women allege he sexually abused them.    On March 3, the Indianapolis Star obtained roughly 5,600 pages of USA Gymnastics records revealing the organization waited years to ban some 54 coaches who were the subjects of sexual abuse complaints. USA Gymnastics took five weeks to fire Nassar and notify the FBI of a complaint against him in 2015, according to CBS.   Howard, now 33, spoke out on CBS’ “60 Minutes” in February. She appeared alongside two other former Team USA gymnasts, Jamie Dantzscher and Jeanette Antolin, who also claimed they were abused by Nassar.   “Emotional abuse is rampant and physical abuse is out there and sexual abuse is a byproduct of what happens when that is the culture,” Howard said during the segment.  </p>
<p>  Victims and their allies have called for more than Penny’s resignation. California attorney John Manly, who represents more than 70 women suing Nassar, sent a letter to Probst, the USOC president, earlier this month demanding the organization strip USA Gymnastics of its certification as the sport’s national governing body. “Without question, the serial rape and molestation of hundreds of girls, by coaches, trainers and other USA Gymnastics’ staff, materially inhibits these women’s ability to participate in their sport and is discriminatory on its face,” Manly wrote. “While the call for Mr. Penny’s resignation is long overdue and applauded, Mr. Penny is only a symptom of this endemic problem,” Manly added. “The entire USA Gymnastics’ leadership and management shares the blame for this failure.” Gymnast Rachael Denhollander, who also accused Nassar of sexual abuse, told the Indianapolis Star on Thursday that Penny’s decision to step down doesn’t spare USA Gymnastics the necessary act of admitting and taking responsibility for failing to protect its athletes. “While I am grateful to see this step, I am disheartened to see that there still has not been a recognition of the deep failures that allowed so many children to be abused while participating in USAG gymnastics,” Denhollander said. Former federal prosecutor Deborah Daniels has been hired by USA Gymnastics to review the organization’s policies. She is expected to release her findings in spring or early summer. Congress has also taken notice of the scandal. More than a dozen senators, led by Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.), introduced a bipartisan bill last week that would require adults working at Olympic governing bodies to immediately report abuse complaints to law enforcement. Failing to report allegations “as soon as possible” would be a crime punishable by fines and up to three years in prison. “Sexual abuse stays with victims their entire lives,” Feinstein said in a statement. “Amateur athletic governing bodies, coaches, and personnel have a special obligation to do all they can to protect young athletes in their care.”  </p>

<p>USA Hockey officials on Wednesday indicated it may field a team of replacement players at the upcoming International Ice Hockey Federation Women’s World Championship should members of the current women’s national team continue their boycott over fair pay issues. </p>
<p>The federation just took another step toward the possibility of sending a replacement team to the event, setting a firm deadline of 5 p.m. Eastern Time Thursday for players to decide if they intended to play. The federation is also surveying individual players to assess their intentions, according to USA Today, which first reported the deadline.</p>
<p>But current team members say they’re committed to skipping the tournament unless there is “significant progress” in negotiations with USA Hockey around compensation and other forms of financial support.</p>
<p>And on Thursday, they told The Huffington Post that their entire player pool is on board with the fight ― including members of the youth teams.</p>
<p>“We said this yesterday that this isn’t just the women’s national team, this is the entire player pool,” said Monique Lamoureux, a forward on the national team. “USA Hockey might be thinking we were bluffing on that but that is totally true. We’ve been in contact with every player in the pool, and we have the support of all the players.”</p>
<p>“It’s really disheartening that USA Hockey has decided to try to field an alternative team instead of negotiating with its national team,” she added. “It’s a sad day when that happens.”</p>
<p>Her comments echoed a statement the team issued through its lawyers Thursday morning.</p>
<p>“We have heard that USA Hockey is attempting to field an alternative team to play in the World Championship games,” the statement reads. “We regret that they have not instead chosen to reconsider their treatment of the current World Championship-winning team. We stand by our original position: that it is time USA Hockey supported its programs for women and girls at the level it provides to boys and men. And we are grateful for the support we’ve received from across the world for our stance on this subject.”</p>
<p>After more than a year of private negotiations, the team’s dispute with USA Hockey exploded into a public fight Wednesday, when the players aired details of the dispute in a release that announced their intention to skip the tournament.</p>
<p>USA Hockey currently provides them only with small, $1,000-per-month stipends during a six-month Olympic training period, according to the players. It does not pay them during the other three-and-a-half years of each Olympic cycle, the team said. Most their pay comes from the U.S. Olympic Committee, according to the players ― and more than half of the squad also holds jobs outside of hockey.</p>
<p>The players were also critical of USA Hockey’s programs for girls, saying that the federation’s investments in the youth development paled in comparison to the money and support it gives to boys and men.</p>
<p>USA Hockey responded Wednesday in a statement that indicated it would not bend, even amid the possibility of missing the tournament. The federation said it had increased compensation, investment and other forms of support for the women’s game ― claims the team called “misleading.”</p>
<p>The team’s fight received considerable public support on social media from lawmakers, former U.S. women’s hockey players, and members of the U.S. women’s national soccer team, who have spent the past year battling their own federation for equal pay.</p>
<p>Members of the women’s hockey team said they hoped they would reach an agreement with the national governing body that both sides found palatable in time for them to play at the World Championship in Plymouth, Michigan. Team USA is the defending champion at the tournament, which begins March 31. It has won six of the past eight gold medals.</p>
<p> “We want to play,” team captain Meghan Duggan told HuffPost on Wednesday. “We want this to get resolved. We want to come to an agreement that USA Hockey and ourselves can both be on board with.” But the public sparring between the two sides, and news of Thursday’s looming deadline, suggests that such an agreement is becoming increasingly unlikely. As for what might happen after the 5 p.m. deadline, Lamoureux said, “USA Hockey has not contacted us or our lawyers to negotiate. The ball’s in their court.” </p>

<p>The U.S. women’s national soccer team has spent the last year waging a public battle with the U.S. Soccer Federation over equal pay and fair wages.</p>
<p>Now, it’s the women’s hockey team’s turn.</p>
<p>Members of the U.S. Women’s National Hockey Team announced Wednesday that they will not play in this month’s International Ice Hockey Federation World Championship tournament, thanks to a lack of progress in their efforts to secure fair wages and benefits from USA Hockey, the sport’s American governing body.</p>
<p>The 2017 Women’s World Championship begins March 31 in Plymouth, Michigan, meaning the absence of the U.S. women’s team would leave the tournament without its host and defending champion. The United States has won six of the past eight world championship gold medals. </p>
<p>“We are asking for a living wage and for USA Hockey to fully support its programs for women and girls and stop treating us like an afterthought,” captain Meghan Duggan said Thursday. “We have represented our country with dignity and deserve to be treated with fairness and respect.”</p>
<p>“It’s unfortunate we had to get to this point,” Duggan told The Huffington Post. “But we stand united ― our entire player pool, our entire national team.”</p>
<p>For more than a year, the players have sought a contract with USA Hockey that would guarantee better compensation, the women said in a release announcing their decision.</p>
<p>The majority of the players’ current pay, they said, comes from the U.S. Olympic Committee, with USA Hockey providing a small, $1,000-per-month stipend over a six-month Olympic training period. Outside those months, the lawyers representing the players said in the release, “USA Hockey pays virtually nothing.”</p>
<p>“We’re asked to train and compete and perform full time,” Duggan said, “yet we’re not compensated for it.”</p>
<p>Roughly half of the players on the team hold jobs outside of hockey, their lawyers said in the release. </p>
<p>Their complaint doesn’t involve just compensation. According to the players, they also receive less support than the men’s team for equipment, staff, associated expenses and marketing. They also pointed to inequities in development programs, asserting that while USA Hockey spends $3.5 million annually on its national team program for boys, girls receive no “comparable” support.</p>
<p>Those differences “show that they’re just not supporting and valuing us like they value the men and the boys,” Duggan said. “We’re asking for their equal support.”</p>
<p>There is a possibility the players could call off their boycott and play at the world championships, if they make progress in negotiations with USA Hockey over the next week.</p>
<p>“We want to play,” Duggan said. “We want this to get resolved. We want to come to an agreement that USA Hockey and ourselves can both be on board with.”</p>
<p>Last March, five U.S. women’s national soccer players filed a federal complaint against the U.S. Soccer Federation, calling for an investigation into what they asserted were discriminatory pay practices. The complaint hasn’t been resolved; the USWNT is also still negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement with the federation.</p>
<p>U.S. soccer star Alex Morgan, one of the five players named on their original complaint, tweeted in support of the hockey players Wednesday:</p>
<p>The USWNT’s fight for equal pay served as inspiration for the hockey team, Duggan said, and they hope to have a similar effect.</p>
<p>“It’s bigger than hockey. It’s bigger than any one sport or individual. It’s about equitable support for females in this country,” she said. “This is a difficult thing for us, but we’re united and proud and happy to do it.”</p>
<p>USA Hockey responded to the players in a statement released Wednesday afternoon, saying it has “a long-standing commitment to the support, advancement and growth of girls and women’s hockey and any claims to the contrary are unfounded.”</p>
<p>The federation said it is implementing support initiatives for the run-up to the 2018 Winter Olympics, including incentives “that could result in each player receiving nearly $85,000 in cash over the Olympic training and performance period,” in addition to other forms of assistance that it says includes housing and travel allowances and insurance. </p>
<p>“We acknowledge the players’ concerns and have proactively increased our level of direct support to the Women’s National Team as we prepare for the 2018 Winter Olympic Games,” said Dave Ogrean, executive director of USA Hockey. “We have communicated that increased level of support to the players’ representatives and look forward to continuing our discussions.”</p>
<p>The statement said that while the federation is “disappointed” the players said they would not participate in the World Championship, USA Hockey is committed to fielding a team for the tournament.</p>
<p>The players responded with a statement of their own that called USA Hockey’s comments “misleading.”</p>
<p>“The statement issued by USA Hockey today in response to our decision to sit out the World Championships is misleading,” the players’ statement said. “It suggests that USA Hockey is prepared to pay the players $85,000 during the Olympic year. That is simply not true and no such offer was ever extended. In its public statement, USA Hockey has coupled their contributions with payments made by the U.S. Olympic Committee, which pays gold medal-winning athletes more than $60,000.”</p>
<p>“Further,” they continued, “it covers only the Olympic period and does not offer anything for each of the other three years during which a World Championship is played. Lastly, it does nothing to address the marketing and training support that is not on par with what it provides to the mens’ and boys’ teams.”</p>
<p>This article has been updated with a statement from USA Hockey and subsequent response from the players, as well as a tweet from Alex Morgan.</p>

<p>We all need a hug sometimes.</p>
<p>Organizers of a high school basketball league in Wisconsin issued an apology on Monday after a league official refused to let the younger brother of a girls basketball player onto the court for a postgame hug.</p>
<p>Video of the denied embrace surfaced on Twitter after Appleton North High School’s victory in the girls Division I state basketball championship on Saturday night.</p>
<p>The video was shared by Nic Levy, father of Appleton North junior Sydney Levy, who is seen attempting to reach her younger brother, 3-year-old Jaylen, according to USA Today. The hug had become a postgame tradition for the little boy and his big sister. </p>
<p>Take a look. </p>
<p>“Obviously, it was disappointing that I didn’t get to hug my brother, but just because the video was of us and the fact that he was a 3-year-old little boy, it doesn’t mean we are the only ones affected,” Sydney Levy later told WBAY. “I had teammates who had family travel from all over who didn’t get to celebrate with them, so that was disappointing.”</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association acknowledged the incident and said that it had expressed its regrets for any difficulties brought on by the situation. A statement released Monday by WIAA Director of Communications Todd Clark reads as follows:</p>
<p> The Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association acknowledges that the short video clip that was released on social media Sunday may be seen by the casual observer as insensitive. In the celebratory situations following a State championship, it is not possible for the WIAA to know the individual traditions and rituals of all the schools, teams, families and players involved. For the safety of all involved, we keep spectators off the playing surface. As an organization that runs large events on a regular basis, our focus is always on the safety and “what if” situations that can evolve quickly and cause potential harm to innocent bystanders. When the WIAA staff receives advanced requests regarding special family situations or needs, we do our best to accommodate if and when possible. The WIAA has reached out to the family to express its regrets for any distress they may have experienced. </p>
<p>On Monday, Nic Levy shared a few additional thoughts on Twitter, highlighting the Appleton North High School girls’ impressive 28–0 season.</p>

<p>Las Vegas, NV - Arizona and Oregon battled for the Pac-12 Tournament title with the Ducks at a major disadvantage. Earlier Saturday they received word that their 6-10 senior forward Chris Boucher suffered a knee injury and would miss the remainder of the season. Playing without Boucher, a important part of Oregon’s success on both ends of the court and with little time to adjust, the Ducks were at a disadvantage against a talented Wildcat team. They showed heart and determination but in the end Arizona prevailed and left the T-Mobile Arena with an 83-80 win behind 23 points from Allonzo Trier.</p>
<p>Boucher is a non-traditional big who spends much of his time on offense in the corner or on the perimeter. That helps draw opposing bigs outside to guard him and opens up the interior for Oregon’s guards to penetrate. He also provides interior defense with his shot-blocking ability and is a strong rebounder. Arizona started the game by posting up 7-0 freshman Lauri Markkanen for two quick hoops but Oregon, with the help of 6-11 reserve Kavell Bigby-Williams, did a decent job of defending inside and ended the game tied with the Wildcats in points in the paint with each team scoring 36 points.</p>
<p>Where the loss of Boucher really hurt the Ducks was in the shortening of their rotation. Without Boucher coming off the bench the Ducks could only muster three bench points, all from Bigby-Williams. In contrast, Arizona had 23 bench points with solid minutes from point guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright and bigs Chance Comanche and Dusan Ristic. Jackson -Cartwright made two key second half three-pointers and Comanche him a important, late corner jumper.</p>
<p>With Jordan Bell (16 points, 10 rebounds) as Oregon’s only reliable big, Arizona used their height and depth advantage to a +10 rebounding advantage. Trier grabbed eight rebounds and was particularly active on both ends of the court.</p>
<p>Arizona defends the ball extremely well led by their starting point guard Khadeem Allen. Oregon’s guards had trouble getting good looks in the first half. The Ducks shot 1-of-8 from distance in the half and needed 17 first half points from Dillon Brooks to close the half within six points (35-29) of Arizona. Oregon went into a press in the second half to speed the game up and to try to create opportunities in transition. The tactic worked as the team combined for 99 second half points with Oregon scoring 51. Tyler Dorsey (23 points) and Dylan Ennis (12) both got aggressive and were able to score off penetration.</p>
<p>Oregon battled back from a 14-point deficit and cut the lead to 77-75 on a Bell put-back. After Trier made two free throws Brooks took a quick three-pointer that looked bad coming off his hands. Arizona grabbed the rebound and Trier made the free throws to seal the victory. The Wildcats got their revenge from the 27-point drubbing the Duck administered in Eugene in the team’s only regular season meeting.</p>
<p>The loss shouldn’t hurt Oregon much in their NCAA hopes as they still will likely get a No. 2-seed. Arizona will likely move up to a No. 2 with an outside chance of a No. 1 seed due to their strength of schedule and their performance since Trier returned to the court.</p>

<p>It's the Best Sport Going </p>
<p>I’m an unapologetic ambassador of the game of hockey. And I think everyone should be a hockey fan. I think it’s the best sport going.</p>
<p>After much has been written about the rise of the sport’s black fandom, I finally decided to do one better. I started to play hockey.</p>
<p>I found a Groupon deal for skating lessons and attended a couple of classes with some kids who were also learning the skate. Some might think it may be dangerous for a man of my size in his 30’s to try something that can be high risk-high reward.</p>
<p>It is one thing to watch hockey at home, or go to a game (which I strongly recommend), it’s another to actually play in a rat hockey (think pick-up basketball) game.</p>
<p>Hockey is an unpredictable sport that works every part of your body, but balance is the key. Standing straight up will most likely lead to falling a lot. Hockey players are more athletic than people give them credit for and they must possess an inner toughness and high threshold for pain.</p>
<p>I also learned that when hockey players are done with their equipment, an unwritten code says that you must try to pass it on to someone who want to learn how to play the game. I was lucky to come across a couple of people who did the same thing for me. And once I was done, I passed my gear onto to someone else.</p>
<p>Along the way, I learned about “hockey culture.”</p>
<p>I didn’t really know what the culture consisted of until I started playing the game myself. As I’ve learned during my time at the rinks across the Chicago area, the game is one the hardest to learn.</p>
<p>The sport is the very definition of getting out of it what you put into it. If you don’t work on your skating, puck-handling and leverage, you won’t be very good. And the guys around you will let you know about it.</p>
<p>I quickly immersed myself in the nuances of the game and the culture that surrounds it. A case of Miller Lite magically appearing in the locker room after a rat hockey game was considered the normal.</p>
<p>Once I learned the nuances of the game, a co-worker told me about a guy who was putting together a beer league hockey team. So I joined the team and met my teammates. Beer league hockey is like no other. Imagine being at the gym and seeing someone crack open a can of beer instead of a water bottle.</p>
<p>When it was time to choose a number for my jersey, I went with No. 30, one of the numbers Val James wore during his career. James was the first African-American to play in the NHL. He was well-known for sticking up for his teammates.</p>
<p>Of course, I’m the only brother on our team, and in the league. That’s never been a problem. I’m on a team with group of good people. Our team consists of an attorney, an engineer, an architect, and a comedian, among others. Along the way, playing the sport and being around them helped me cope with covering shooting after shooting as a working journalist in Chicago. Our team ended up playing in the league championship game as well.</p>
<p>The league, which consists of people who’ve either just started playing, or hadn’t played in years, was a lot more physical than I thought. And most like most rec leagues, we had a couple of players who once probably thought they were going to play in the NHL one day, along with a few “Ringers” who were too good and seemed to skate around everyone with ease.</p>
<p>Even though there’s supposed to be no checking, there’s plenty of it. During my first season, I often worried about hurting someone because of my size. Think Winnipeg Jets player Dustin Byfuglien with more girth.</p>
<p>In one instance, me and a player from the other team were going for the puck. My goal was to clear it while he was trying to get something going in their offensive zone. Long story short, I laid the guy out. He was in mid air with his feet up.</p>
<p>My teammates joked that I got a penalty for “playing hockey.”</p>
<p>Halfway through the season, we played a team whom we previously had a physical game with . During the game, I found myself with the puck in the offensive zone with no one around. At this point, it’s just me and goalie.</p>
<p>Next thing I knew, after a couple of dekes, the puck ended up at the back of the net.</p>
<p>I scored a goal.</p>
<p>What I remember next was hearing the excitement from my teammates. After all, they’ve seen me go from a guy who couldn’t skate to the other end of the ice to someone who made a difference in helping the team preserve a victory.</p>
<p>Even the other team cheered a little.</p>
<p>My wife and my daughter were in the crowd. They didn’t see the goal, so I can embellish the circumstances of me scoring much like Al Bundy as the years go by.</p>
<p>After the game, our team captain handed the puck over to me. It sits on the wall near my desk.</p>
<p>About that championship game, believe it or not, it was an intense affair. The crowd was raucous, a bit of shit-talking was involved and we traded goals along the way. After the game, I thanked the team for the season we had. I got the see the sport I love so much in a different light.</p>
<p>Along the way, I got to see why hockey fans are so passionate (sometimes to a fault) about the sport. Which is why I suggest more people watch the games.</p>
<p>Remember during the playoffs last season when Tony X tuned into the end of a Blackhawks/Blues game? Think about his timeline as he discovered what many hockey fans already knew.</p>
<p>He didn’t understand what was going on but he knew that the game was fast-paced and exciting. Judging from his tweets, he had never seen anything like it. And the Blues ended up inviting him to a game.</p>
<p>As he said, it was “lit.”</p>
<p>Hopefully, someone watched Tony’s youthful exuberance and decided to watch the sport. And beyond that, like me, perhaps they decided to take some skating lessons and take up the game.</p>
<p>One can only hope. It’s been one of my greatest experiences.</p>

<p>FIFA president Gianni Infantino on Thursday warned the United States and President Donald Trump that banning travelers from six Muslim-majority countries could negatively affect the country’s chances of hosting the 2026 World Cup.</p>
<p>The U.S. Soccer Federation, the sport’s American governing body, has been considering a bid ― whether by itself or in a joint effort with Mexico ― for the 2026 World Cup since losing out on the 2022 tournament to Qatar. But failure to guarantee access to the country for teams and athletes who qualify could jeopardize an American bid, Infantino cautioned.</p>
<p>“It’s obvious when it comes to FIFA competitions as well, any team, including the supporters and officials of that team, who qualify for a World Cup need to have access to the country, otherwise there is no World Cup,” Infantino said, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>Infantino avoided directly criticizing Trump, saying that the president is “in charge, together with his government, to take decisions that are best for his country. That’s why he has been elected.”</p>
<p>Last month, a federal court struck down Trump’s original ban, which restricted travel from seven Muslim-majority nations and temporarily barred refugees from entering the country. Trump issued a revised order this week that bans non-visa holders from six of those countries from traveling to the U.S. The new version, which is now facing legal challenges and may also be unconstitutional, still temporarily disbands refugee resettlement programs.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how or whether the ban would actually affect the 2026 World Cup, given that it won’t take place until after Trump leaves office. But it could have an impact on how FIFA voters view the United States during the bidding process, which will likely begin this year. Infantino said FIFA is currently finalizing bid requirements.</p>
<p>“The requirements will be clear,” he said. “And then each country can make up their decision, whether they want to bid or not based on the requirements. It’s general sporting criteria.”</p>
<p>In February, a Tibetan women’s soccer team failed to secure visas to travel to an April tournament in Dallas, after officials at the U.S. embassy in India told 16 players they had “no good reason to visit the U.S.” India, where the Tibetan players live, is not among the seven countries listed in Trump’s original ban, or the six included in the new one.</p>
<p>U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati was among the critics of Trump’s original travel ban, which he said was not “consistent with a lot of American values.” </p>
<p>Gulati said at the time that it was too early to determine how the ban ― which had some effect on the sports world and was criticized by many athletes, including U.S. Men’s National Team captain Michael Bradley ― might affect the federation’s plan to bid on the 2026 World Cup.</p>
<p>Even during the 2016 campaign, Gulati suggested that Trump’s election could hurt American efforts to host the World Cup, in part because of the then-candidate’s comments about Mexico and Mexican immigrants.</p>
<p>“I think the world’s perception of the U.S. is affected by who is in the White House, yes, so it has some bearing, sure,” Gulati said in June. “I think a co-hosted World Cup with Mexico would be trickier if Secretary Clinton isn’t in the White House.”</p>
<p>Gulati walked those comments back after Trump’s victory in November, saying that the federation looked forward to working with the president if it decided to bid on the 2026 World Cup.</p>

<p>The Brazil Open wrapped up on Monday with Uruguay’s Pablo Cuevas winning the title — but the real stars of the tennis tournament have four legs and, if we’re being honest, not-so-great form.</p>
<p>Six dogs from animal shelters in Brazil served as “ball boys” on Saturday to raise awareness for pet adoption, and also just to wow the crowds with their overwhelming cuteness.</p>
<p>Cindy, Nanda, Blackie, Mia, Arlete and Ovelha came from two animal shelters in Sao Paulo — Second Chance (Proyecto Segunda Chance) and Dogs Without Owners (Cão Sem Dono), according to ATP World Tour. The dogs joined Brazilian tennis player Marcelo Demoliner and coach Joao Zwetsch in an exhibition match on Saturday.</p>
<p>“It was pretty fun, super cool with the dogs, really nice experience,” Demoliner told the outlet. He did note that the canines might need to “improve a bit” if they were going to serve in a real match.</p>
<p>This was the second year that dogs up for adoption joined the Brazil Open. In 2016, four former street dogs took to the courts and have all since been adopted.</p>
<p>“We want to show that abandoned dogs can be adopted and trained,”Andrea Beckert, a dog trainer who worked with the 2016 crew, told CNN last year. “After all, it’s not easy to get a dog to only pick up the lost balls, and then to give them up!”</p>
<p>All of the dogs who appeared at the event last year have already been adopted. We hope this year's talented team all find homes soon, too.</p>

<p>Great Britain’s Laura Muir won her first championship gold medal when she broke a 32-year-old European Indoor Championships record in the 1,500-meter race on Saturday.</p>
<p>But when it was time for Muir to take her victory lap, a game of chicken ensued between the 23-year-old runner from Scotland and a stringent official. </p>
<p>“They said: ‘We don’t have time.’ I thought, it’s my first medal. I’m not going to lose out on my lap of honor,” Muir explained after the race in Belgrade, according to The Guardian. “I’m going. Andy, my coach, was saying: ‘Do it,’ so I got there in the end.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Muir eventually broke away (who was that official kidding?) and enjoyed her moment in the spotlight.</p>
<p>Muir ran the 1,500 meters in 4 minutes, 2.39 seconds. On Sunday, she claimed her second gold medal when she won the women’s 3,000-meter race.</p>

<p>Another home match against a bottom half side, another frustrating draw. It seems no matter what Mourinho does to improve his squad with matches in domestic cups and in Europe, the Premier League performances seem to endlessly disappoint Manchester United supporters.</p>
<p>In a weekend where a win would see United go 4th until Arsenal v. Liverpool concluded, and then into 5th until the next Matchweek, an opponent such as Bournemouth would have been a welcome guest. United won the away match on the opening day of the season and the Cherries have just one point from their last six games, and have never beaten (nonetheless scored at Old Trafford) Manchester United at home. </p>
<p>Jose Mourinho gave the EFL Cup Final Man of the Match and Manchester United February Player of the Month Zlatan Ibrahimovic a start and Wayne Rooney and Luke Shaw saw themselves in the starting XI as well. Michael Carrick, whose testimonial match was announced earlier in the week, would be paired alongside Paul Pogba in midfield. </p>
<p>As expected, United were on top early and had a catalog of fantastic chances early in the first half. Martial and Pogba both had shots saved by Artur Boruc and Zlatan had one or two chances neutralised by a Bournemouth back four who seemingly welcomed United’s attacking players behind and in. It was however, a combination between Marcos Rojo and Antonio Valencia following a corner that gave United the lead. The score could have easily been 3 or 4:0 by the time United took the lead, but as has been the theme of the season, chances taken but not converted. </p>
<p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Cherries defender Tyrone Mings tussled in the centre of the pitch which earned the Swede a caution and an ugly, late challenge by Bournemouth captain Andrew Surman earned him a yellow as well. In the 40th minute, the visitors had themselves a rare chance which saw Marc Pugh sprint into De Gea’s box and taken down by Phil Jones which was penalised with a penalty. Former United youngster Josh King duly converted from the spot and equalised. For the remainder of the first half, tensions were on the rise as Zlatan and Mings continued to duel and during a corner, the two became tangled again and it appeared the defender leapt into Zlatan’s elbow, but Surman did not take kindly to the incident and shoved the striker to the ground, earning him his second yellow and reducing his side to 10-men. Half-time came with both sides level.</p>
<p>The second half started with United with a little slower tempo than in the first. The passes were slower and there were fewer chances, despite having a one man advantage. The chances United did have, however, were on target but Boruc kept out the efforts of Wayne Rooney, Ibrahimovic and Martial once more. Jose decided on one of his trademark triple-substitutions at the 70th minute, seeing Rooney, Carrick and Shaw replaced by Rashford, Fellaini and Lingard. Still United pressed, still nothing to show for their pressure.</p>
<p>Paul Pogba did not have a good afternoon once again. Later in the second half, the French midfielder had three or four chances that he either missed or flubbed entirely. United were awarded a penalty after a handball in the box which Zlatan stepped up for. However, he telegraphed his placement and Boruc saved brilliantly to his lower right to keep the scores level at fulltime. </p>
<p>There were many talking points. Did Zlatan and Mings deserve to be sent off with Surman? All of the chances United had, how many does it take to win in the League? Did the draw end United’s hopes of a top four finish, and Champions League football along with it? These are all questions that will be asked over the week, before United fly to Russia to face Rostov in the Europe League Round of 16 on Thursday night and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the FA Cup on Sunday. Even with a 17-match unbeaten record in the Premier League, eight are draws and if Mourinho wants United in the top flight of Europe next season, his team will need to convert their chances to get all three points. </p>

<p>LONDON, March 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Sajjad Husaini and Sayed Ali Shah Farhang from Afghanistan’s persecuted Hazara minority make unlikely ski champions.</p>
<p>But the pair, now training in the Swiss Alps, are hoping to become war-torn Afghanistan’s first winter Olympians. Husaini, 25, and Farhang, 26, are from the mountainous Afghan province of Bamiyan, famed for its ancient Buddha statues that were blown up by the Taliban in 2001.</p>
<p>As children, Husaini and Farhang fled to Iran with their families to escape Afghanistan’s violence. They returned as young adults just as the Bamiyan Ski Club was established in 2011. Lugging borrowed skis on their shoulders, they trekked up the Bamiyan mountains and taught themselves to ski down.</p>
<p>After winning three championships at Afghanistan’s national competition, the pair have been training as slalom skiers in Switzerland for three winters.</p>
<p>“They progressed incredibly well,” their Swiss trainer Andreas Hanni said by phone from the Swiss resort of St Moritz. “Two years ago when they first started, they couldn’t ski parallel, but now they are racing.”</p>
<p>Husaini thought skiing in Switzerland would be as easy as skiing on powder snow trails back home. “When we came here, I couldn’t even control my balance on the compact ski trails. We were training with short skis that tourists use for leisure,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite their lack of experience, both skiers qualified for the Alpine Skiing world championships in St Moritz last month. They advanced to the semi-finals after competing in four rounds of qualifying races in the giant slalom, against competitors from more than 70 countries.</p>
<p>“This was the first time Afghanistan was represented in the winter championships, and we are proud to be ice breakers,” Farhang said via instant messenger from the Alps.</p>
<p>Now the Afghan skiers are training for the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. An instinct for survival may have helped them make such extraordinary progress.</p>
<p>The Hazara are a Persian-speaking, mainly Shi’ite minority who have long faced persecution in Afghanistan, with thousands massacred by the Taliban and al Qaeda in the 1990s. In-fighting between Afghanistan’s two skiing federations meant they received no support from home, the skiers said.</p>
<p>“Like everything, unfortunately sport has also become politicized in Afghanistan,” said Husaini. “We came here to represent our nation, but none of the officials called us, not even for a minute to give a word of encouragement.”</p>

<p>Luis Guillorme isn’t just swinging bats on his way to the major leagues: He’s catching them, too!</p>
<p>The Mets’ prospect recently made an unexpected play while waiting in the dugout during the Mets’ spring training matchup against the Marlins on Thursday. </p>
<p>During the second inning, the Marlins’ Adeiny Hechavarria lost control of his bat while swinging at a pitch from Robert Gsellman. The bat flew toward the dugout and casually into the hand of Guillorme.</p>
<p>A bare hand. </p>
<p>Teammate Brandon Nimmo can be seen in the video dodging out of the way.</p>
<p>“I just literally saw the bat coming at me and caught it. Didn’t think much of it,” Guillorme told Cut4. “Usually when stuff like that happens, I really don’t get out of the way. I saw it the whole way. I threw my hand at it. The bat just happened to land on it.”</p>
<p>The epic catch has naturally garnered the attention of those on social media:</p>
<p>Guillorme also told Cut4 that he had “150 new Instagram notifications and 45 texts” after the incredible catch.</p>
<p>We’re willing to bet his ‘gram is going to keep blowing up if his career keeps on this trajectory. Nice goin’, Guillorme.</p>

<p>Aaron Gordon entered the NBA in 2014 as an enticing young prospect who’d already achieved tremendous success at every major level. After capturing two California state championships and dominating the AAU circuit, he earned MVP honors from the highly prestigious McDonald’s All-American Game ― an award previously won by the likes of LeBron James, Jabari Parker and Dwight Howard. In college, he was named Pac-12 Freshman of the Year while guiding Arizona to the Elite Eight.</p>
<p>Finally, the Orlando Magic made the San Jose native the fourth overall pick in the NBA draft, providing one of the league’s most hapless franchises with a marquee name. Maybe he wasn’t the next Shaq or Penny Hardaway, but Gordon offered hope and excitement to a rudderless organization in dire need of it. What’s more, Gordon possesses many of the qualities that teams covet in an emerging star, including humility and selflessness.</p>
<p>At just 21 years old, Gordon has an almost supernatural understanding of what his body needs to be successful. He believes that the mental aspect of basketball is just as important as the physical side ― maybe even more so. It’s why he sets aside specific times to nap at least 30 minutes per day, and why he devised a nutrition plan based on a high-protein diet to help him operate as efficiently as possible. It’s also why he practices yoga and acupuncture regularly during the offseason to help his muscles regenerate. </p>
<p>“I’m at the point where I come out on the court, I’m looking to do just play,” he tells The Huffington Post. “It sounds simple but it’s not. I clear my mind and I stay in the present moment and I play the game. I make the read, I see the game, I feel my body, I feel my feet and it’s just more fun. It’s liberating.”</p>
<p>By trading Serge Ibaka to Toronto, the Magic have reinstalled Gordon in his natural four-man slot, yielding excellent early returns. </p>
<p>At 6 feet 9 inches and 220 pounds, Gordon is a superior athlete and physical specimen ― even by NBA standards ― with a lightning-quick first step and the rare ability to defend all five positions. A ferocious and creative dunker who uses his strong frame to absorb contact, he also finishes very well at the rim. </p>
<p>He displayed all of this in a Feb. 25 win over Atlanta, connecting on 7-11 shots while tallying 18 points, 3 assists and 2 steals ― a testament to his dynamic versatility and remarkable athletic ability.</p>
<p>Gordon, who in his third season as a pro is averaging a career-high 11 points per game, feels more at ease on the floor, even when he’s played out of position on the wing.</p>
<p>“He made some great, great plays,” Orlando head coach Frank Vogel said after the win against Atlanta. “He’s getting the ball now with space and no one between him and the basket, whereas when he was playing on the perimeter, they were backing up and there was a body in front of him at all times.”</p>
<p>“You have to be very diligent and very disciplined,” Gordon said. “Becoming very in tune with what’s happening, from my toes to the top of my head to my fingertips.”</p>
<p>“After my rookie-year injury [a fractured left foot], I understood that if I want to be a Hall of Famer ― if I want to do everything I want to do ― then I’m gonna need to take care of my body,” he said. “I’m very detail-oriented when I need to take care of my body.”</p>
<p>Part of how Gordon stays fresh and sharp is finding ways to challenge his brain. While many young NBA players spend a nontrivial amount of time on video games and social media, Gordon’s downtime revolves more around reading and meditation, a habit he says began during his youth. He often plays the piano ― Outkast is a favorite ― to exert his mind in multiple ways, and he marvels at how his downtime makes him feel.</p>
<p>“Sports psychology isn’t all that embraced yet in the sports world,” he says. “It’s starting to become prevalent and more recognized.”</p>
<p>When Gordon was 11 and just beginning to comprehend how far basketball might one day take him, he tore his ACL and sustained a major concussion. As he worked his way back, it was his older brother Drew ― starring for UCLA and then New Mexico ― who garnered all the headlines. By taking a step back, Gordon also came to understand how much the game can consume you.</p>
<p>“[My brother] went through a little bit of that identity crisis,” Gordon said. “Like, ‘Am I a basketball player or am I a human being?’”</p>
<p>When Drew discovered that delicate balance, his game then kicked into high gear, blossoming to new heights. Following a brief NBA stint, the older Gordon brother has since become one of the best professional players in all of Europe. </p>
<p>Ultimately, it was witnessing Drew’s struggle and perseverance that allowed Aaron to grow as a person, and as a player. The next steps are to deploy his strenuous practice regimen and complement his powerful athleticism. By becoming a more consistent perimeter shooter (he converts just 28 percent from 3 and 32 percent in catch-and-shoot opportunities), a better ball handler and a more confident post-up player, Gordon’s production will dramatically increase.</p>
<p>Regardless of what happens on the court, though, Gordon ― whose vibrant personality has led to endorsement deals with Nike and Uptime Energy ― will be at peace seeking fulfillment from other aspects of life, hoping a sound mind and body will only help.</p>
<p>“Basketball is not my life,” he says. “It’s a portion of my life. I like developing the person before I like developing the basketball player. What happens is if you develop the person, then the basketball player becomes better... I realize that it’s easy to fall into the trap of becoming a basketball player, but eventually you go through an identity crisis.”</p>
<p>“It’s never too late to understand who you are as a person,” he muses. “Basketball has always been a sanctuary for me to free my mind, and it’s not gonna change.”</p>

<p>Every soccer team needs someone like Francis Kone on its side.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the quick-thinking striker for Czech First League team Slovacko saved the life of an opponent who’d been knocked unconscious during a game.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting for medical staff to arrive on the pitch, he pushed his fingers into the mouth of goalkeeper Martin Berkovec, who plays for the rival Bohemians 1905 team, to stop him from choking on his tongue.</p>
<p>Berkovec was stretchered off the pitch and treated at hospital. After making a full recovery, he paid heartfelt tribute to Kone via Facebook:</p>
<p>Kone’s heroics were caught on camera and the footage is now going viral, with dozens of Twitter users dubbing him a “hero.”</p>
<p>The Ivory Coast-born Kone, who has played at international level for Togo, appeared to play down the incident at the opposition team’s Dolicek Stadium in Prague.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t the first time I have done that. It’s something like the fourth time. Twice in Africa, once in Thailand,” Sky Sports News reports him telling Czech media after the game, which ended in a 0-0 draw. </p>
<p>Bohemians manager Miroslav Koubek also expressed his gratitude to Kone, who he said acted “very professionally.” </p>
<p>“As far as I’m concerned, that was more important than the whole game,” he added.</p>

<p>A junior hockey player was arrested and charged with assault on Sunday after he left the penalty box to attack a referee.</p>
<p>The incident took place during the final moments of the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) championship game between Erie Community College and Dakota College in Binghamton, New York.</p>
<p>Footage shared by Sports Illustrated shows Erie freshman defenseman Brandon Day leave the penalty box and tackle the official, who appeared motionless on the ice. Thirty-nine seconds remained in the contest, which Dakota led 7-4.</p>
<p>Referees called off the remainder of the title game and awarded Dakota College the victory.</p>
<p>Day was taken into custody by SUNY Broome campus police.</p>
<p>“The NJCAA national office has been made aware of the incident that occurred during its hockey championship game and will take all necessary steps to gather as much information from tournament officials and local authorities regarding violations to the association’s sportsmanship code. This type of behavior will not be tolerated in the NJCAA,” said Mark Krug, the NJCAA assistant executive director.</p>

<p>Muhammad Ali’s namesake son and the boxing legend’s former wife went on MSNBC Monday to discuss what it was like to be stopped at an airport in their own country for no reason they could determine except their religious faith.</p>
<p>Customs officers detained Muhammad Ali Jr. at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Feb. 7 as he and his mother, Khalilah Camacho-Ali, returned to the U.S. from Jamaica.</p>
<p>They were heading to the baggage claim, Ali said, when “the guy from immigration pulled me aside and asked me my name.”</p>
<p>Ali recalled, “I was like, “OK, my name is Muhammad Ali,’ and he asked me, ‘What is your religion?’”</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘Why would you even ask me what my religion is?’” Ali continued:</p>
<p> I said, ‘I’m Muslim,’ and it was like he didn’t believe me because he took me in a backroom and asked me the same questions again. So I answered them and I was like, ‘What is this all about?’ </p>
<p>Ali said officers would only tell him, “We’re checking something.”</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘OK, but I was waiting an hour and 45 minutes for you to check something,’” he said, adding that the officers split him and his mother up and he was worried about her.</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali Jr., 44, was carrying a U.S. passport at the time of his detention. He has no criminal record.</p>
<p>He and his mother said they travel extensively and have never been profiled like this before. </p>
<p>While officers had also stopped his mother, they released her shortly after she produced a photo of herself with her famous former husband, reports the Courier-Journal.</p>
<p>Other individuals have faced similar questioning by Customs and Border Protection agents since President Donald Trump signed an executive order banning refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from traveling to the United States. A federal judge halted the order prior to the Alis’ detention.</p>
<p>Camacho-Ali suggested Monday that if officers are hassling her and her son, they’re undoubtedly hassling other Muslims, and she’s happy to fight back on their behalf.</p>
<p>“Muhammad Ali, everybody knows him as a person who stands up for what you believe in,” Camacho-Ali said. “We must carry on that legend, because if we let people get away with it now, then there will be no end to the trauma. These people are going through a lot, not just us,” she said.</p>
<p>If she were given the opportunity to speak with President Trump, Camacho-Ali said she’d ask him to read the Qur’an and to recognize that Muslims “are people of peace.”</p>
<p>In a statement to The Washington Post, Customs and Border Protection denied that the Ali family had been detained because they’re Muslim.</p>
<p>“Every day CBP officers process more than 1.2 million international travelers,” the agency said. “We accomplish our mission with vigilance and in accordance with the law. CBP does not discriminate based on religion, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation … We treat all travelers with respect and sensitivity.”</p>
<p>Family lawyer Chris Mancini, also speaking to MSNBC, dismissed that statement as untrue.</p>
<p>“Are they questioning you if you’re a Christian? Are they going to ask you if you’re a Jew?” Mancini said. “That statement flies in the [face] of what we know is actually happening.”</p>
<p>He said, “We’ve always protected people’s religious rights as something that was fundamental, rock-solid foundational in our Constitution. ... Since when do we ask people about their religions when they enter the United States?”</p>

<p>Charles Barkley is famously outspoken, so when we got the chance to hear his thoughts on the current state of basketball, we had to take it. One of the hosts of the Emmy Award-winning “NBA on TNT,” Barkley ― who captured league MVP honors in 1993, earned 11 All-Star appearances and is a two-time Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee ― spoke with The Huffington Post recently to discuss Cleveland’s struggles, why the race for the championship is only between three teams and what is wrong with today’s NBA.</p>
<p>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>
<p>You teamed up with Autotrader and Second Harvest Food Bank of Greater New Orleans. Why have you made it a priority to help those in need? </p>
<p>It’s interesting ― the greatest country in the world, we shouldn’t have people starving. We shouldn’t have young people not getting something to eat. </p>
<p>You seem to have very much targeted kids in dire need. </p>
<p>Kids are born into the situation they’re born into, and obviously they have no control over that. And we, as adults, it’s up to us to take care of kids ― that’s part of your moral responsibility. I always tell people, “There’s two groups we should take care of ― old people and young people.” And this is just my small little way of helping.</p>

<p>It’s not the same for me now, because, I mean, we work so much. We’re on every day for hours and hours. The All-Star Game was fun when I played in it because it was an amazing weekend, but it’s a little bit different now that I’m doing television, because man, it’s hectic.  </p>
<p>What is the bigger first-half NBA surprise to you: the Spurs’ success or the Cavs’ struggles?</p>
<p>What [the Spurs have] done the last 20 years has just been amazing. Obviously they’ve won five championships, but to be competitive every year, it says a lot. Listen, I don’t think the Cavaliers have struggled as much as people think ― I think the Cavaliers have been bored, because they realized they’re going to win the Eastern Conference unless somebody [made] a trade. So I think they’ve just been bored more than anything. </p>
<p>Are we merely staring down at a three-horse race for the title, between Golden State, San Antonio and Cleveland? </p>
<p>Yeah, I think that’s very safe to say, and that’s one thing that bothers me about the NBA today. We shouldn’t have just three good teams ― that drives me nuts. And then people tell me [that when I played], “the same team always won the championship.” Well I say, first of all, that’s not true. The Bulls won, the Spurs won, the Pistons won, the Lakers won. But they were all pushed. </p>
<p>Like, we know the Cavaliers are going to be in the finals ― I mean, they don’t even get pushed. Even Michael [Jordan’s] Bulls, remember ― people forget they had some great seven-game series with the Knicks, they had some great seven-game series with the Pacers. They were always pushed. It wasn’t like, “Well, they’re gonna get to the finals.” There were a couple times even when the Bulls won the championship, they had some knock-down, drag-out games with the Knicks and the Pacers. It wasn’t just like a cakewalk like it is now. </p>
<p>Just how impressive is Houston with James Harden and Mike D’Antoni?</p>
<p>Yes, I think everybody is [surprised], but it goes to the genius of Mike D’Antoni and the great work that James Harden has done. I don’t think anybody thought that the Rockets would be playing this well, but Mike D’Antoni is doing the same thing he did in Phoenix ― he’s just an offensive genius, plain and simple.</p>
<p>Should D’Antoni then be Coach of the Year and Harden the league MVP? </p>
<p>Well, I think simply Harden and [Russell] Westbrook are the two front-runners for MVP. I think you have to pick your poison on that one. They both look great. And D’Antoni is clearly the front-runner, and now who’s probably gaining on Mike D’Antoni is Scott Brooks ― he’s doing a fantastic job in Washington. </p>
<p>Speaking of the Wizards, what changed for that team? They were a lifeless 2-8 ― dead in the water ― at the beginning of the season.</p>
<p>Well, [John] Wall said he got in shape. People forget he had knee surgery on both knees and it took him a while to get into shape. But if you actually looked at it on paper, I think the Wizards probably have the most talent that can compete with the Cavaliers. They played probably the best NBA game I’ve seen in years. But if you look at it, they’re probably the second best guard combination in the NBA.</p>
<p>Listen, Otto Porter is playing out of his mind, [Markieff] Morris is playing out of his mind. I worry about their depth, but if you look at it from just a talent standpoint, the Wizards probably have the second best team in the Eastern Conference.</p>

<p>The son of the late boxing great Muhammad Ali was detained at a Florida airport this month and asked about his religious preferences, a family friend says.</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali Jr., 44, was returning to the U.S. from Jamaica with his mother, Khalilah Camacho-Ali, when customs pulled them aside at the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport on Feb. 7 for questioning, Chris Mancini, a family friend and lawyer, told the Courier-Journal Friday.</p>
<p>Customs officials let Camacho-Ali proceed once she produced a photo of herself with her former husband Muhammad Ali, but since Ali Jr. did not have such a photo, they detained him for almost two hours. During his detention, he says officials asked him questions like “Where did you get your name from?” and “Are you Muslim?”</p>
<p>Ali Jr., who like his late father is Muslim, is an American citizen with no criminal record. He was carrying a U.S. passport with him at the time of his detention.</p>
<p>“This is an outrage,” said Mancini, who is a former federal prosecutor. “I don’t know what is going on with Mr. Trump’s claim that his ban is not religion-based. We do not discriminate in this country based on religion.”</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly contended that his executive order banning refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries is “not a Muslim ban.” A federal judge blocked the order was blocked days before Ali Jr. was detained. </p>
<p>“What right does the United States have to inquire about somebody’s religion when they enter the country?” Mancini said. “This is an instance where the ban has been enforced even though it has been thrown out. The government is still trying to find grounds to keep Muslims out.”</p>
<p>Multiple outlets have reached out to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for comment, which has simply said, “Due to the restrictions of the Privacy Act, U.S. Customs and Border Protection cannot discuss individual travelers; however, all international travelers arriving in the U.S. are subject to CBP inspection.”</p>
<p>The Ali family is considering filing a federal lawsuit. </p>
<p>“To the Ali family, it’s crystal clear that this is directly linked to Mr. Trump’s efforts to ban Muslims from the United States,” Mancini added.</p>

<p>Karl-Anthony Towns is ahead of schedule by even the highest of expectations.</p>
<p>Yes, he led the University of Kentucky to a 38-1 record and the Final Four, became the No. 1 pick in the 2015 NBA draft and earned Rookie of the Year honors last season. But at 21, he could have flamed equally quickly.</p>
<p>Instead, Towns has emerged as one of the league’s premier big men.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Timberwolves center is both humble and quick to deflect praise. He gives much of the credit to his coaches. And he thanks former T-Wolves teammate and now Los Angeles Clippers consultant Kevin Garnett, whom he keeps in close contact with. </p>
<p>“KG talks a lot about accountability,” Towns told HuffPost about the man he calls “such a legend.”</p>
<p>“When he does something, right away you pay attention,” Towns added. “If you make a mistake, he’s all about holding you accountable.”</p>
<p>Towns, to be sure, has done his part. </p>
<p>He’s averaged 24 points, 12 rebounds and 3 assists, according to ESPN.com. No other player in the league boasts such numbers this season. He also ranks 13th in overall efficiency: His 24.55 rating slots him ahead of Stephen Curry, Blake Griffin, DeMar DeRozan, Hassan Whiteside, Marc Gasol and John Wall.</p>
<p>Few players in just their second season have made such drastic improvements to their skill set as Towns has.</p>
<p>One skill that doesn’t necessarily reflect in the box score is Towns’ superior footwork around the basket. His dexterity and his ability to let a defender encroach on his hip and air space have driven up his free-throw opportunities from year one to year two. At the All-Star break, Towns’ 302 free-throw attempts had already surpassed the 275 he managed over his entire rookie season.</p>
<p>Of course, getting to the line and actually converting at the line are two very different things, particularly for centers. Just ask Shaquille O’Neal about that. </p>
<p>Towns converts 83 percent from the stripe ― an outrageously high rate, better even than that of most guards and such well-known shooters as Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis. He’s also surpassing fellow emerging big men like Anthony Davis and Joel Embiid.</p>
<p>Towns’ silky shooting is what makes him such a dynamic offensive player. He converts a respectable 34 percent from the 3-point distance and is even more effective from 16 to 18 feet, where he asserts himself in three distinct ways: the pick-and-roll, the pick-and-pop and as a slip man.</p>
<p>“I’m very comfortable in the pick-and-roll,” he said. “I like to do it. I’ve grown as a player, I’m glad to say that.”</p>
<p>Towns’ rapid development stems in part from T-Wolves head coach Tom Thibodeau, who embraces the versatility of his young star.</p>
<p>“His skill set is so unique for a 7-footer,” Thibodeau told ESPN.com in November. “He can shoot the 3 with ease from all over the floor ― from the corners, from above the break, from the top of the key. He can put it on the floor. He can change direction. He can Euro-step. He can play back to the basket. He can play a face-up combo game. You can pick-and-roll with him where he’s the screener. You can pick-and-roll with him where he’s the ball handler. He has guard-like skills. He has great vision. He has playmaking ability.”</p>
<p>Towns appreciates that his coach lets him be himself, but also that Thibodeau insists the young T-Wolves follow the program.</p>
<p>“He’s given us a lot,” Towns said of his coach, who took the Minnesota job last August. “Taking accountability ... we are more responsible and even tighter knit as a group.”</p>
<p>Before he was drafted, the New Jersey native told HuffPost that he was “not just a basketball player” ― he likes playing golf and baseball, too. More recently, he has been bitten by the acting bug, something he hasn’t done since an assortment of church plays as a kid.</p>
<p>In a recent ad for Jack Link’s beef jerky, he worked out with Sasquatch. “I kind of pinched myself,” Towns said. “I love acting and being able to show my personality.”</p>
<p>This is all what makes Towns such an intriguing young star. He desperately wants to be great, but only within the framework of the team. He wants more opportunities like the Jack Link’s spot, but only when that doesn’t get in the way of his athletic development. He prizes everything about basketball, but he enjoys being well rounded as well.</p>
<p>“I just find ways to take time,” Towns said. “Enjoying little things like being home, talking to family and seeing family grow up.” </p>

<p>Chris Christie, once thought to be a potential Republican candidate for U.S. president, is now in the running for a job of a very different variety: Mike Francesa’s.</p>
<p>NorthJersey.com reported Wednesday that WFAN 660-AM’s program director, Mark Chernoff, would be interested in hiring the New Jersey governor as the replacement for legendary afternoon radio host Mike Francesa, should Francesa actually decide to retire at the end of 2017. </p>
<p>“I would certainly at least want to consider him,” Chernoff told the outlet. “If he’s interested and we’re interested, it’s worth pursuing.” </p>
<p>WFAN, which predominately covers sports in the tri-state, famously became the first radio station to dedicate itself entirely to sports 24 hours a day in 1987. </p>
<p>Christie would be just one among “plenty of [other] candidates,” cautioned Chernoff, who is also vice president of WFAN’s parent company, CBS Radio New York.</p>
<p>Christie is set to end his time as governor of New Jersey less than a month after Francesa is expected to retire. Speculation about Christie’s interest in Francesa’s gig has only grown increasingly louder since he called in to the host’s show in January to discuss his next opportunities, saying he’d “have wide-open ears.”</p>
<p>Last week, Christie told the SNY cable network that his son told him it would be “great” if someone paid him to talk about sports, since the son had been listening to his father talk about them for his “entire life.” </p>
<p>“So, yeah, that’s certainly one of the things that I hope I’ll have a chance to consider when I get out and stop being governor,” he added. </p>
<p>Even if Christie is interested in the job, people on the internet expressed shock that the governor, who this time last year was just weeks removed from running for president of the United States, would take on such a gig.</p>
<p>Some noted the irony of him potentially moving into the entertainment business as President Donald Trump gets used to life in government. But with the whole scandal surrounding the bridge lane closings in his home state, I mean, what did you really expect? </p>
<p>By the way, Chris Christie is a Dallas Cowboys fan. </p>

<p>Golf champ Rory McIlroy hit into the social media rough after playing golf with President Donald Trump on Sunday.</p>
<p>McIlroy, who has won four majors and is the World No. 3, told No Laying Up he accepted an invitation to play with the president at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, despite recovering from a stress fracture in his rib.</p>
<p>A picture posted Saturday of him on the links with Trump, ClearSports CEO Garry Singer and former New York Yankees star Paul O’Neill made the rounds, but Mclroy told No Laying Up that O’Neill and Singer were not part of the Sunday foursome.</p>
<p>McIlroy called the commander-in-chief a “decent player for a guy in his 70s,” but the Internet was not all compliments about the golf star associating with the controversial chief executive. To some Twitter users, McIlroy had dug a hole for himself.</p>
<p>In all fairness, McIlroy did get some support too.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Lakers announced Tuesday that they have purged their front office in a shake-up that will leave former Laker great Earvin “Magic” Johnson in charge of turning the once-great franchise around following the worst half-decade of basketball in its lauded history. </p>
<p>In a release, the team said it has put Johnson “in charge of all basketball operations” and fired general manager Mitch Kupchak, who had overseen the team’s day-to-day basketball decisions since 2000. The Lakers are already “well underway” in their search for a new general manager, they said. </p>
<p>Additionally, the team announced that vice president of public relations John Black has been relieved of his duties, and Jim Buss, the son of the late Lakers owner Jerry Buss and one of the team’s owners, will no longer hold the title of executive vice president of basketball operations. Chief operating officer Tim Harris will also find his own replacement, the release said. </p>
<p>The news shocked the basketball world for multiple reasons ― for one, simply because Mitch Kupchak, Jim Buss and John Black had all been associated with the Lakers for decades, over which time the franchise won five championships and made it to seven NBA Finals with star players like Shaquille O’Neal, Kobe Bryant and Pau Gasol. </p>
<p>The decision also comes just two days before the NBA trade deadline, and two days after reports emerged that the flailing team decided against including Brandon Ingram, the No. 2 pick in the 2016 NBA Draft, in any trade discussions for enigmatic NBA All-Star DeMarcus Cousins. (Cousins was traded to the New Orleans Pelicans soon after the All-Star Game on Sunday evening.)</p>
<p>The Lakers currently have the third-worst record in the league and a strong incentive to stay that bad, if not get worse, since the team will give its first-round draft pick in the 2017 NBA Draft to the Philadelphia 76ers should it fall out of the top three.</p>
<p>As such, many basketball insiders expected them to shop leading scorer Lou Williams at the deadline in an attempt to heighten their odds at keeping their pick in the draft come June. </p>
<p>But with Mitch Kupchak gone and no clear replacement in order, how they will be able to make such a trade has left analysts scratching their heads. </p>
<p>Johnson first returned to the team in February, when it was announced he would become a business and and basketball adviser to Jeanie Buss, the Los Angeles Lakers’ team president and Jim Buss’ sister.</p>
<p>Jeanie, who remains the team’s top decision-maker, said Tuesday that she made the decision to clean house with the team’s best interests in mind, and Johnson called it a “dream come true to return to the Lakers as President of Basketball Operations working closely with Jeanie Buss and the Buss family.”</p>
<p>But the decision to replace Jim Buss and Mitch Kupchak with Magic Johnson has left many Lakers fans nervous. Even though the team is currently just 19–39, Kupchak had recently drafted well, picking up solid pieces like Ingram and D’Angelo Russell in the first round of the draft, as well as finding gems like Jordan Clarkson and Ivica Zubac in the second.</p>
<p>Kupchak had also helmed a number of the league’s biggest transactions during his time with the Lakers, including trading for Pau Gasol, who became the second best player on two championship teams, and agreeing to a deal with the then-New Orleans Hornets for Chris Paul ― which was infamously rescinded by the league for “basketball reasons,” leading to the stretch of mediocre-to-bad Lakers basketball that continues to this day.</p>
<p>Whether Johnson can pull something off that Kupchak couldn’t remains to be seen, but many remained dubious on Tuesday as they laughed about some of his famously head-scratching tweets. </p>
<p>Either way, this is the end of one era and the start of another. </p>

<p>Kyrie Irving of the Cleveland Cavaliers believes the Earth is flat.</p>
<p>To be sure, planet Earth is round. But during a Friday podcast hosted by his teammates Channing Frye and Richard Jefferson, Irving declared that the Earth is flat.</p>
<p>“This is not even a conspiracy theory. The Earth is flat,” Irving said, urging people to do their research on the matter. The point guard blamed “them” for lying to us but did not clarify who “they” are.</p>
<p>“What it really came down to for me,” Irving explains, “was everything that was particularly thrown in front of me, I had to be like, ‘OK, this is all a facade, this is all something that they ultimately want me to believe in that is true or whether or not or whatever.’”</p>
<p>(If you can stomach it, you can hear more of his explanation here, starting at the 15:00 mark.)</p>
<p>His flat Earther remarks were so strange they trended on Twitter later that day. Obviously, ESPN writer Arash Markazi had to ask him about it later that night.</p>
<p>“What’s your thoughts on that?” Markazi asked, failing to hold back his laughter. </p>
<p>“I think people should do their own research,” Kyrie reiterated to Markazi. “Hopefully they’ll either back my belief or throw it in the water.”</p>
<p>And if you’re keeping tallies on all Irving’s beliefs, he does think dinosaurs were real, but he doesn’t think scientists nailed down what they looked like. </p>

<p>A lawyer for New York Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis says his client was on the defensive during a street fight in Pittsburgh on Sunday ― but law enforcement apparently disagrees.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police said Thursday they have charges pending against the four-time All-Pro for robbery, conspiracy, aggravated assault and terroristic threats.</p>
<p>In the early hours confrontation with Revis, two men were knocked out cold for several minutes, police said in a release posted by the city’s Department of Public Safety. The trouble supposedly began when one of the men spotted Revis on a Pittsburgh street and asked him if he was indeed the football player. Receiving an affirmative, the man began following him as he filmed the veteran star, police say.</p>
<p>Revis then took the man’s phone and attempted to delete the video. The other man tried to intervene, prompting Revis to throw the phone on the ground, according to the release. A verbal confrontation then escalated to physical as an associate joined Revis.</p>
<p>The release states that the two men were able to speak with police. Witnesses told cops that the two were unconscious for about 10 minutes, police say. Officers retrieved the video and were able to determine that the person encountered by the two men was Revis.</p>
<p>Blaine Jones, Revis’ lawyer, gave a different account to a CBS affiliate in Pittsburgh. He said that Revis “was not the aggressor that night. He was the victim. He tried to retreat.”</p>
<p>As of mid-morning Friday, Revis had yet to surrender to police. According to Jones, Revis would turn himself in “rather soon.”</p>

<p>The majority of players invited on an all-expenses paid trip to Israel have pulled out after coming to the conclusion that the government was using them to promote a political agenda and improve its image abroad. </p>
<p>Only five of the 11 players originally slated to attend the trip ended up going following revelations that the Israeli tourism minister hoped the players would become “ambassadors of goodwill for Israel.” Earlier this week, Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett wrote in a statement published on Instagram that he would not be “used” in such a way.</p>
<p>“I was not aware that my itinerary was being constructed by the Israeli government for the purposes of making me, in the words of a government official, an ‘influencer and opinion-former’ who would then be ‘an ambassador of goodwill,’” he wrote. </p>
<p>“I will not be used in such a manner,” he added. “When I do go to Israel – and I do plan to go – it will be to see not only Israel but also the West Bank and Gaza so I can see how the Palestinians, who have called this land home for thousands of years, live their lives. I want to be a voice for the voiceless, and I cannot do that by going on this kind of trip to Israel.”</p>
<p>After Bennett announced he would not make the trip, his younger brother, New England Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett, also decided to bow out, as well as Seahawks defensive end Cliff Avril, Miami Dolphins wide receiver Kenny Stills and San Francisco 49ers running back Carlos Hyde, according to The Guardian. </p>
<p>Former NFL linebacker Kirk Morrison and Denver Broncos running back Justin Forsett also didn’t make the trip, although Forsett apparently opted not to go weeks ago because his wife is expecting a child. </p>
<p>In the lead-up to the trip, the Israeli minister for strategic affairs and public diplomacy said he hoped the players would help counter “negative and false characterizations of Israel.” Israeli Tourism Minister Yariv Levin similarly said he hoped “after they have seen the unique tourist sites and the special atmosphere here, [the NFL players] will become ambassadors of goodwill for Israel.”</p>
<p>News of the all-expenses paid vacation led activists, including Angela Davis, Alice Walker and John Carlos, to publish an open letter on The Nation last week asking the players to reconsider attending. “These trips bringing celebrities to Israel are part of a larger ‘Brand Israel’ campaign to help the Israeli government normalize and whitewash its ongoing denial of Palestinian rights,” they wrote. </p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited with U.S. President Donald Trump this week to discuss the ongoing conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.</p>

<p>A photo that appears to show New York Knicks president Phil Jackson riding a New York City bus is on a viral roll.</p>
<p>But whether this truly is the 6-foot-8 executive folded into a seat isn’t really the point.

<p>The jokes are definitely not as tough to grasp as the Zen Master’s triangle offense.</p>
<p>The image appears to date back to at least November, but now is as good a time as any to pick on the beleaguered ― yet highly paid ― sports executive.</p>

<p>Marv Albert is often referred to as “the voice of basketball.” An eight-time Emmy Award winner and a National Sports Media Association Hall of Fame inductee, the 75-year-old broadcaster has been calling NBA games since 1967.</p>
<p>Throughout his illustrious career, Albert has also broadcasted six Super Bowls, two World Series, the NBA Finals and the Stanley Cup Finals, among other marquee events.</p>
<p>The TNT announcer, who will call his 22nd NBA All-Star game this weekend in New Orleans, told The Huffington Post about his relationship with Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr, explained why the New York Knicks are a disaster and described how social media has changed the NBA’s overall landscape. </p>
<p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>
<p>You covered the Olympics in Rio. Team USA had a stretch where it wasn’t dominant and actually struggled a bit, before ultimately capturing a third straight gold medal. Did you ever get the sense that coach Mike Krzyzewski was worried?</p>
<p>I think that Coach K was very concerned, actually. Carmelo [Anthony] didn’t look like he was in the greatest shape, and also his shoulder was bothering him. The only good game he had ― we talk about it constantly ― was against China, where you and I might have put up double figures. </p>
<p>Until they finally changed the rotation and went with [Kyle] Lowry and [Jimmy] Butler ... that’s when they started to roll. Even though [DeMarcus] Cousins overpowered people, it was better to have DeAndre Jordan in there. He had to figure it out. </p>
<p>You’ve covered George Karl throughout your career. He just published a book that was very critical of Cousins, as well as many other players he coached. </p>
<p>We always spent about 10-15 minutes before games with the coaches and you couldn’t leave, he didn’t want us to leave ― he just wanted to talk. </p>
<p>Phil Jackson did that too, while he was still coaching the Lakers. He’d take shots at Kobe in his books. He couldn’t reach Shaq, and Kobe [Bryant] too, which is tough. He would take shots in the papers ― in Chicago he did it a little bit. He was a little more careful because Michael [Jordan] was not going to accept that. The only people he would take an occasional shot at was like [Toni] Kukoc, who was a great guy and really a very good player but he was like the whipping boy. He always had a guy he would be screaming at, Horace Grant and Kukoc.</p>
<p>Do you enjoy the current NBA product, considering there is such an assortment of one-and-done college players?</p>
<p>The fundamentals are not, at times, what they were when guys were playing three or four years [in college]. A guy like C.J. McCollum, who comes in from Lehigh and turns out to be a tremendous player ― but I mean, he’s gifted ― that doesn’t happen that often. Usually, if the guy is really that good, they wanna come out, and I can understand it. You don’t want to get hurt, you could blow a contract, obviously you get the higher salary quicker. </p>
<p>But the league is in the best shape it’s ever been in terms of marketing, the global aspect, and I realize there’s always an argument ― are you better off with parity, or having the super teams? And right now, you basically have two teams ― maybe three in the West ― who maybe have a shot? I don’t know if that’s even true ― it’s probably Golden State and San Antonio. And in the East, although Boston is getting better, they’re like a player away from something.  </p>
<p>When did it really hit home for you that this league is, at its core, a business?</p>
<p>I think more so in the ‘90s. Teams when I first started ― you did have nucleuses of teams staying together, of the better teams. In the ‘70s, the Knicks, the Celtics, Milwaukee, you had teams with seven or eight guys that would be there for several years. </p>
<p>Young players are pushing older players out because they are often cheaper, even if they aren’t as good. </p>
<p>Except if they have contracts, those players pushed out would be the eighth player on the roster. </p>
<p>Do you remember such an influx of talented point guards? </p>
<p>You always have to go back and look. Sometimes it seems like the present, but you’re probably right. I’m thinking just like a broad view in my mind of the ‘90s. It was different ― it was more plodding. </p>
<p>It’s funny, I’m doing stuff on [Russell] Westbrook. He’s chasing Oscar [Robertson] for the triple-double. It didn’t seem like it when I think back to it, but Oscar ― when he did it in ‘62 ― they played at a faster pace. They had like 120 possessions a game and Oklahoma City has 105 or something, it didn’t seem like it. </p>
<p>Today’s NBA puts such a premium on the whole league. With social media, it often feels like playing in a major market doesn’t matter anymore.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter at all, because if you’re a big market now, it doesn’t mean that you’re necessarily a destination for a player. </p>
<p>Look at the Knicks: I don’t know if there are that many players [who would want to go to New York] with the way they have been for the last 15-20 years. I mean, they’ve gone to the playoffs three times in 15 years. This would not be a destination. I mean, you see [Kristaps] Porzingis, you see a couple of the other guys. Would you want to come here? </p>
<p>And then if you don’t do well, you get killed media-wise, but it’s different also because, I think, [of] the commercials. It shows that you can be in Oklahoma City, you can be in a small market, you look at when [Kevin] Durant and Westbrook were here: They got a lot of commercials, so they became national stars and they are big attractions, aside from being an attraction at home.</p>
<p> I know it’s better for the league if New York or LA, Chicago ― you know, the big markets ― do well, but it doesn’t matter anymore. Because of the television, in terms of the marketing, in terms of international. Like when I’ve done games overseas. You’d be in Japan and they knew every player from 1-12 ― that started to happen I think after the Dream Team [in 1992]. It really took off after that.</p>
<p>You mentioned the Celtics. Brad Stevens has been the one guy to go from coaching in college to coaching in the NBA successfully. </p>
<p>I think he’s exceptional. And what happened was ― I mean, Butler went to the finals twice, it was amazing. I think it added to the reputation, that guys respected him. At any age, that’s a terrific job putting that roster together and collecting draft picks, and it was a lot of young guys and they were looking at Brad Stevens as, ‘Boy, this guy can coach,’ as they saw in college. </p>
<p>But I think there will be others. It’s a risk for a guy who is extremely successful in college, it doesn’t always translate. </p>
<p>Considering how long you have covered the league, do you still feel the same level of excitement and inspiration from the game today? </p>
<p>Oh yeah, definitely, I love doing it. I still do, I kinda like the preparation. There’s some weeks I’d like to be home, go to the movies. My wife and I see every movie, we somehow get it in in between, and I’m like a news fanatic ― I watch CNN and MSNBC all the time, then I’m checking out Fox to see what their point of view is just to see it. </p>
<p>But anyway, I like doing the preparation, I still love being around and talking to guys. I love talking to coaches, working with the guys that I work with. It’s filled with fun and laughs, it’s a challenge, and the crowds ― I still get a rise out. It can give you the chills sometimes.</p>
<p>The Knicks are just an utter disaster, from top to bottom. Obviously you know all too well about the failures of this organization. </p>
<p>I really feel removed. It’s funny when someone says, well, ‘Who do you root for, who do you want to win?’ and I haven’t rooted for anybody. I mean, when I was doing a local team, I did the Knicks and I did the Nets for five years. You get to know guys and you want them to do well. There’s certain guys I always wanted, or I had more interest in because I had a personal relationship, but I feel you have to be objective. </p>
<p>And even doing local games, the level of my voice would be raised if the opponents did something really well, too. But it’s better, if you’re doing a local team, if your team is successful ― because I went through a number of years with the Knicks where they were pretty bad. It’s not as interesting. I kind of distance myself from that, but I haven’t rooted for anyone in any sport since I was a kid. </p>
<p>You worked with Steve Kerr in the broadcast booth. You’ve said how impressed you were with him, but have you even been surprised at the tremendous success he’s had leading the Warriors? </p>
<p>He’s the best. Such a good guy, and he’s very smart, like [Gregg] Popovich. But he’s well read, and you saw what both he and Popovich had to say [politically]. They’re both terrific guys.</p>
<p>To me, it was like a no-brainer [for Kerr to decide to coach the Warriors over the Knicks]. You look at the rosters. The papers came out, and it was crazy. I mean, he asked me, and I did say, ‘There’s no choice here,’ but I know the Knicks blamed me initially. </p>
<p>I was one of many who told him, but his friendship with [Knicks president Phil Jackson] had a lot to do with the fact that he was even leaning in that direction. He’d never coached! He was a general manager and actually did well, he stepped away from broadcasting for a couple of years.</p>
<p>His Phoenix Suns team reached the conference finals.</p>
<p>He did pretty well with that. As a coach, he’s so good with people. I mention it on the air: I say it was a tumultuous eight years with Steve, but he was the best to be around. And very competitive ― he doesn’t take any crap! With Draymond [Green], too, he was ready to go at him last year, that was written, he’s pretty tough. He had that little brief tiff with Michael [Jordan] in practice. But that’s Michael. </p>
<p>What was your relationship with Michael?</p>
<p>Michael is the greatest to talk to, though. He was smart enough to know he was good to be on TV in the ‘90s, where we’d sit down with the guys and get a soundbite or two. Everything he said you could put on the air ― he was so good. Everything out of his mouth from a television point of view was just worthwhile.</p>

<p>After a number of New England Patriots players announced their decision to skip the team’s upcoming visit to the White House because of President Donald Trump, Tom Brady has decided to weigh in on the matter, too.</p>
<p>The superstar quarterback, who helped his team take home the Super Bowl LI trophy with a 34-28 win against the Atlanta Falcons earlier this month, said during an interview on NBC Sport’s radio show PFT Live Tuesday that “everybody has their own choice.”</p>
<p>Brady, who has had to miss the White House visit in the past due to scheduling conflicts, added that he doesn’t see a visit to the White House as political. </p>
<p>“It really is a great experience,” Brady added. “Putting politics aside, it never was a political thing. At least, it never was to me. It meant you won a championship and you got to experience something cool with your team, with your teammates. Everyone has their own choice. It’s an offseason. These days are valuable for everybody. You only get so much time with your family and friends, and if people don’t want to go they don’t want to go and that’s their choice.”</p>
<p>Multiple Patriots players have said they will skip the trip, including free safety Devin McCourty. “I’m not going to the White House,” McCourty told TIME. “Basic reason for me is I don’t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won’t.”</p>
<p>Trump and Brady have known each other for years, and the POTUS claimed to have Brady’s vote back in November. </p>
<p>“Tom Brady, great guy, great friend of mine, great, great champion, unbelievable winner,” Trump said at a November rally. “He called today and he said, ‘Donald, I support you, you’re my friend, and I voted for you.’”</p>
<p>Gisele later denied it. But either way, Trump ― who is also friendly with team owner Robert Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick ― was happy the Patriots won. </p>

<p>Now that’s teamwork.</p>
<p>A New Jersey Catholic Youth Organization basketball team of 5th grade boys and girls just made the play of the season ― and no score was necessary.</p>
<p>Told by the league director to remove the two girls from the team or forfeit the season, the St. John’s Chargers of Clark, New Jersey, voted unanimously before a game Friday to stand by their teammates, NJ.com reported.</p>
<p>The opposing team and officials departed the gym, leaving St. John’s to play an intrasquad scrimmage with many wearing #unitygames” T-shirts, For The Win noted.</p>
<p>Watching those hands go up in the vote after the kids were briefed on the consequences ― the cancellation of the game and no playoffs ― is one of the more touching moments you’ll see in sports at any level.</p>
<p>“These kids are doing the right thing,” team parent Denise Laskody said through tears.</p>
<p>According to NJ.com, the team had been coed for several years and was alerted two weeks ago that the presence of the girls would be an issue. Jim Goodness, spokesman for the archdiocese of Newark, told the outlet that rules “specifically state the teams should be boys or girls only.” But parents said there simply wasn’t enough interest from girls to form their own team.</p>
<p>No matter the rules, one player in the clip could not envision advancing to the postseason without all his teammates. “It’s not fair that we get to move on and they can’t,” he said.</p>

<p>The United States Tennis Association apologized on Saturday for introducing a Fed Cup match with a portion of Germany’s national anthem that was once used as Nazi propaganda.</p>
<p>Fans and players appeared visibly upset as an opera singer belted out the controversial, outdated first verse in German: “Germany, Germany, above all, above all in the world.” People attending the event in Hawaii were seen attempting to sing over the performer.</p>
<p>The “Deutschlandlied” lyrics were written in 1841, nearly 100 years before Adolf Hitler’s Nazi Party took control of Germany. But the Nazis later made that first verse their own, weaving it into their party’s song.</p>
<p>”Deutschlandlied” was briefly banned after World War II. Now, only its third verse is included in the country’s national anthem.</p>
<p>German player Andrea Petkovic later expressed outrage over the performance and said she considered walking off the court, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>“I thought it was the epitome of ignorance, and I’ve never felt more disrespected in my whole life, let alone in Fed Cup,” she said at a press conference. “I’ve played Fed Cup for 13 years now and it is the worst thing that has ever happened to me.”</p>
<p>The USTA later issued a statement to apologize for what happened.</p>
<p>“We extend our sincerest apologies to the German Fed Cup team and all of its fans for the performance of an outdated National Anthem prior to today’s Fed Cup competition,” it read. “In no way did we mean any disrespect. This mistake will not occur again, and the correct anthem will be performed for the remainder of this first-round tie.”</p>

<p>New York Knicks owner James Dolan fired a top security official and banned former player Charles Oakley from the team’s arena days after the ex-Knick was ejected from his seat and arrested. </p>
<p>In an ESPN radio interview on Friday, Dolan revealed that Oakley would be indefinitely blocked from Madison Square Garden after a brief argument and scuffle between Oakley and guards unfolded in front of stunned fans and players. Oakley, who appeared to push at least one guard, was charged with three counts of assault and a single count of criminal trespassing. </p>
<p>Dolan and Oakley, a favorite with Knicks fans from his 10 seasons with the franchise, have clashed before. According to Dolan, Oakley instigated the latest altercation because he has “personality problems.”</p>
<p>“I think that Charles has got a problem. I’ve said this before…. He has a problem. People need to understand that. He has a problem with anger. He’s both physically and verbally abusive. He may have a problem with alcohol, we don’t know,” Dolan said on “The Michael Kay Show.” “But those behaviors, being physically and verbally abusive, those are personality problems.”</p>
<p>In the fallout from the embarrassing scene, Dolan fired Madison Square Garden’s senior vice president for security, Frank Benedetto.</p>
<p>What started the incident during the game against the Los Angeles Clippers is in doubt. Dolan and Knicks officials contend that Oakley was agitated and had yelled obscenities at the Knicks owner and other personnel. </p>
<p>Oakley has denied yelling at Dolan and said the security guards had no reason to confront him. He claimed that security has followed him during previous games he’s attended because of the bad blood with Dolan. </p>
<p>“I’m [not going to] walk into a place and just start hollering out, ‘James Dolan, James Dolan.’ That’s embarrassing, man. I did not do none of that. I didn’t know [Dolan] was sitting in front of me at first until [the security guards] walked over there,” Oakley said, according to USA Today.</p>
<p>NBA players and fans have largely rallied behind Oakley. </p>
</doc><doc id="694" filename="SPORTS" url="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nfl-texas-anti-trans-bathroom-bill_us_589df60ee4b0ab2d2b14c6e3" headline="NFL Says Anti-LGBTQ Bill Could Cost Texas Future Super Bowls" date="2017-02-10" authors="Travis Waldron">
<p>The NFL took a strong stand Friday against proposed legislation in Texas that would prevent transgender people from using public restrooms that match their gender identity, saying the bill could potentially keep the state from hosting future Super Bowls.</p>
<p>“If a proposal that is discriminatory or inconsistent with our values were to become law (in Texas), that would certainly be a factor considered when thinking about awarding future events,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told the Houston Chronicle on Friday, just days after Houston hosted Super Bowl LI.</p>
<p>“The NFL embraces inclusiveness,” McCarthy said. “We want all fans to feel welcomed at our events, and NFL policies prohibit discrimination based on age, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other improper standard.”</p>
<p>The Texas legislation ― known officially as the Texas Privacy Act, or SB6 ― was introduced in January and is similar to a law passed last year in North Carolina. That law cost North Carolina multiple high-profile sporting events: the NBA pulled its All-Star Game out of Charlotte, while the NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference each moved several championship events ― including NCAA Tournament games and the ACC’s football title game ― out of North Carolina.</p>
<p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has expressed interest in bringing the Super Bowl back to Arlington’s AT&T Stadium when the next round of bidding begins. Jones has also said he wants to bring the NFL Draft to a new Cowboys facility in Frisco. </p>
<p>The legislation could complicate those plans. A Cowboys spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on the legislation or its potential effect on Jones’ desire to host those events. </p>
<p>Texas is also scheduled to host multiple major NCAA and Big XII conference events over the next two years.</p>
<p>Dallas will host the 2017 women’s basketball Final Four in April and early-round men’s NCAA Tournament games in 2018. San Antonio will host the 2018 men’s basketball Final Four. AT&T Stadium will host the Big XII Conference’s football championship later this year, and the NCAA and Big XII also regularly hold championship events for other sports in the state.</p>
<p>The Big XII office is “tracking” the legislation “and will discuss [it] with our membership at an appropriate time,” Bob Burda, the Big XII associate commissioner for communications, said in an email Friday.</p>
<p>It is likely too late to alter plans for major events scheduled for this spring. It is unclear how the legislation, should it pass, would affect the NCAA’s future plans. </p>
<p>The NCAA last year began requiring prospective host cities to fill out a survey that included questions about how they would protect students, fans and players from discrimination during and around events.</p>
<p>This week, the North Carolina Sports Association, a nonprofit group that promotes sports and recreation in the state, urged lawmakers there to repeal its version of the law in order to attract sporting events back to Charlotte and other North Carolina cities. The NCAA is currently considering host sites for championship events through 2022, and the failure to repeal the law, the North Carolina Sports Association warned, could cost the state NCAA events for the next six years.</p>
<p>Asked about the Texas legislation, an NCAA spokesperson reiterated the message it sent in response to the North Carolina Sports Association letter, saying that it has not yet determined future championship sites but expects to in April. North Carolina, the spokesperson noted, remains the only state where the NCAA has moved events due to discrimination concerns.</p>
<p>None of Texas’ three NBA teams are scheduled to host the league’s All-Star Game in the coming years. But the NBA’s stance on North Carolina’s law ― it has said it won’t return to Charlotte as long as it remains in effect ― means that approval of the anti-transgender bill would likely also doom the prospects of the event returning to Texas at any point in the foreseeable future. </p>
<p>Texas Lt. Gov Dan Patrick (R) and the 14 Republicans sponsoring the bill this week vowed to push forward with SB6, over the objections of business leaders within the state. On Monday, Patrick dismissed those objections as “fear-mongering.”</p>

<p>Ibtihaj Muhammad, an Olympic fencer for Team USA, has revealed that she was held at an airport by U.S. Customs and Border Protection late last year without explanation.</p>
<p>Muhammad, a U.S. citizen and the first American to compete in an Olympics wearing a hijab, told the website PopSugar on Tuesday that authorities detained her for about two hours.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why. I can’t tell you why it happened to me, but I know that I’m Muslim. I have an Arabic name,” she said. “And even though I represent Team USA and I have that Olympic hardware, it doesn’t change how you look and how people perceive you.”</p>
<p>Muhammad, a native of Maplewood, New Jersey, won bronze in the women’s team sabre event at 2016 Olympic games. The victory made her the first female Muslim American to medal for Team USA.</p>
<p>Muhammad attempted to describe her emotions following the incident.</p>
<p>“It’s really hard. My human response is to cry because I was so sad and upset and disheartened — and just disappointed,” she said. “At the same time, I’m one of those people who feels like I have to be strong for those people who may not be able to find that strength. I feel like I have to speak up for those people whose voices go unheard.”</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s travel ban has been put on hold by a federal judge after a chaotic rollout and protests at airports across the country.</p>
<p>Muhammad’s comments were made following an appearance at the MAKERS conference. The fencer appeared with gymnast Gabby Douglas for a conversation about empowerment, representation and athleticism.</p>
<p>UPDATE ― Monday, 12:21 p.m.: On Saturday, Muhammad thanked those who supported her since she first discussed the incident and said she would continue to fight for people affected by “profiling & bigotry.”</p>

<p>College basketball’s freshmen class of 2016 was graced with the much-hyped Australian Ben Simmons, a polarizing blend of passing and rebounding whom Philadelphia selected first overall in the NBA Draft. There was also Duke’s Brandon Ingram ― unfairly compared to Kevin Durant ― and the Lakers’ choice with the second pick. Naturally, Kentucky was actively involved in this process, too. In fact, there were five freshmen drafted in the lottery and 10 in the first round last year.</p>
<p>The 2017 freshmen class is once again brimming with potential, perhaps even more than last year. Duke, for example, has a wealth of talent: Power forward Harry Giles, while small forward Jayson Tatum and combo guard Frank Jackson have also flashed tremendous ability, albeit not in consistent doses.</p>
<p>John Calipari’s quartet of ESPN Top 100 recruits in Lexington isn’t too shabby either. Malik Monk stole all the headlines when he dropped a school-record 47 points ― including the eventual game-winning triple ― against highly touted North Carolina in Las Vegas. But his backcourt mate, De’Aaron Fox, is a lightning quick point guard with splendid creative abilities and exceptional on-ball defensive characteristics.</p>
<p>Maybe the best freshman of all, however, is Washington’s Markelle Fultz, an enticing playmaker with few flaws. The 6-foot-4 guard hailing from the basketball-rich Washington, D.C., area averages over 23 points per game, which ranks sixth in the country. And he could very well be the No. 1 pick in June, should he turn pro.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are my top 25 freshmen ― not ranked in order ― for this college hoops season.</p>

<p>New England Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount and defensive end Chris Long both said Thursday that they will not visit the White House to celebrate the team’s victory in Super Bowl LI, bringing the total number of Patriots players who plan to skip the customary trip to at least five.</p>
<p>Tight end Martellus Bennett, linebacker Dont’a Hightower, and defensive back Devin McCourty said earlier this week they wouldn’t visit President Donald Trump’s new home. </p>
<p>Long tweeted Thursday morning that he would not make the trip, in response to a New York Daily News column that urged him to skip it.</p>
<p>Later Thursday afternoon, Blount told “The Rich Eisen Show” that he too would skip the visit.</p>
<p>“I just don’t feel welcome into that house,” Blount said. “I’m just gonna leave it at that.”</p>
<p>Bennett and McCourty also said Trump was the reason they won’t visit the White House with their teammates. Hightower, who visited the White House after winning a national championship at Alabama but skipped the Patriots visit in 2015 ― when Barack Obama was still president ― said his decision had nothing to do with politics, but that he had “been there, done that.” Long didn’t give a reason for his decision and didn’t respond to an interview request made through the Patriots.</p>
<p>Patriots quarterback Tom Brady previously skipped the team’s trip to the White House in 2015. Brady cited a family commitment as his reason for missing the ceremony. The Boston Herald, however, reported that Brady was unhappy with White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who had cracked a joke about the quarterback’s public response to the Deflategate scandal.</p>
<p>Other players could still decide against visiting the White House. Running back James White, for instance, was noncommittal on Wednesday, when he told radio host Alex Marvez that he would “wait till the time comes and decide then.” </p>

<p>Former NBA player Charles Oakley was arrested on Wednesday during the game between the New York Knicks and the Los Angeles Clippers after an altercation with security guards at Madison Square Garden.</p>
<p>Oakley, who played the bulk of his 19-year career in New York, had to be forcibly removed from his courtside seat by several security guards after he was seen pushing and arguing with them.</p>
<p>The scuffle was provoked by Oakley yelling at Knicks owner James Dolan, according to the New York Daily News.</p>
<p>Oakley, 53, has been estranged from the Knicks franchise and owner Dolan for some time after making public criticisms.</p>
<p>The game stopped briefly while Oakley was being walked away from the court, as players looked on and the crowd chanted “Oakley! Oakley” as he was being led away.</p>
<p>The Knicks tweeted a statement following the incident.</p>
<p>“Charles Oakley came to the game tonight and behaved in a highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner,” it read.</p>
<p>“He has been ejected and is currently being arrested by the New York City Police Department. He was a great Knick and we hope he gets some help soon.” </p>

<p>   After Chino Hills High School’s leading scorer, LiAngelo Ball, injured his ankle, his brother LaMelo was given the go-ahead to shoot more on Tuesday, the Los Angeles Times reported.   </p>
<p>   The California sophomore certainly took the message to heart. He scored a staggering 92 points in a 146-123 victory over visiting Los Osos.  Here are the numbers, per USA Today: He made 37 for 57 field goal attempts and was 11 of 14 from the free throw line. For good measure, he also had seven assists and five rebounds. In one quarter alone he dropped 41 points. “He loves to score,” Ball’s father, Lavar, said, per ABC News. LaMelo reportedly dedicated his performance to a young woman who is seriously ill.   </p>
<p>   Chino Hills Coach Stephan Gilling called the performance “very exciting.” But opposing coach Dave Smith wasn’t having it: “The Ball boys are very talented and great players, but it’s embarrassing to high school athletics,” he told the Times. “I’ve been coaching for 35 years, and we’ve turned high school athletics into individualism.” Incidentally, older brother Lonzo Ball is currently a star freshman at UCLA who may be heading toward the NBA next season. Chino Hills’ 60-game winning streak had been stopped the previous game, prompting Lonzo to send out this tweet Tuesday night:   </p>

<p>The Atlanta Falcons dominated Super Bowl 51 until Tom Brady and company decided that enough was enough. Through a series of Falcon’s penalties and Patriots playmaking, New England hijacked the Lombardi Trophy in the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history.</p>
<p>Although the Falcons were up against arguably the greatest quarterback in NFL history backed by a formidable team, when you’re up by 20 points and lose, somethings amiss. Not even the magic of Matt Ryan and Julio Jones was enough to save them. So instead of returning to Atlanta as Super Bowl champions, the Falcons are forced to settle for second best.</p>
<p>The Falcons have a rallying cry: “Rise Up.” This season every football fan in Atlanta has been proudly chanting it as the “Birds” made mincemeat out of almost every visitor to the Georgia Dome. But now the fans have left the building and the excitement is gone. The dream of being crowned Super Bowl Champions in 2017 has been relegated to the dustbin of history. No one will remember the team that took second, only that Brady and his Boston bandits never quit and were crowned.</p>
<p>What’s unknown in this story is how the Falcons will respond. Coach Dan Quinn did a magnificent job of leading his team to Houston, but he will undoubtedly be scrutinized for his team’s inability to close out a game that his gridiron warriors clearly dominated.</p>
<p>In the long run, only one thing really matters: Will the Falcons “Rise Up” after being publically humiliated in front of a billion people? Or is this battle cry just a marketing slogan created at the Falcon’s complex in Flowery Branch by guys in pin stripe suits and granny glasses? Is Matt Ryan, the 2017 NFL MVP, intelligent enough to learn from Professor Brady’s class on mental toughness and roar back to the top in 2018? Or will he and the Falcons quietly return to Atlanta with their tails between their legs and shrink back into NFL mediocrity?</p>
<p>Time will tell, but here’s the beauty of the scenario: Millions of kids that worship the black and red uniform and chant its battle cry are about to find out what “Rise Up” really means. The Falcons may have allowed the Super Bowl to slip from their hands, but that’s not nearly as important as what they do now as their impressionable young fans watch them mourn. It’s easy to be a role model when you’re basking in the glow of victory, but when you’ve been embarrassed in front of 1/7 of the world’s population, grace doesn’t flow so naturally.</p>
<p>Yes, Atlanta is about to find out what its Falcons are really made of, and what’s revealed will set the stage for the future of Arthur Blank’s franchise. My hope is that Coach Quinn and his maestro, Matt Ryan, will lead this team to truly “Rise Up” from the ashes of defeat and show their city that it isn’t just a slogan, but a way of life. Football may only be a game, but it’s also a great metaphor for living. It’s not about how many diving catches Julio can make or how many completions “Matty Ice” can throw; it’s about how much defeat, disappointment and despair they can suffer and still keep “Rising Up” with their heads held high and their hearts in tact. If the 2017 Falcons can pass that lesson on to their adoring young fans, it will serve them in a far greater way than any championship t-shirt they may have worn around school.</p>
<p>Note to Falcons: The big game is over. You’re beat up, emotionally exhausted, and disappointed to the point of despair. Just remember that there are millions of us who look up to you as heroes, as Gods of the gridiron, and your extraordinary feats of magician-like athleticism not only entertain us, but also give us hope in a world that sometimes seems hopeless.</p>
<p>We will all be watching, and you have the opportunity to teach us how to bounce back in your moment of despair. So “Rise Up”, Falcons, and show us what you’re made of.</p>

<p>Less than 48 hours after their stunning 34-28 overtime defeat to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI, the Atlanta Falcons hired Alabama’s Steve Sarkisian as their new offensive coordinator.</p>
<p>Sarkisian served as the Crimson Tide’s OC during the national championship loss to Clemson. He replaces Kyle Shanahan, who on Monday was hired as the new head coach of the San Fransisco 49ers.</p>
<p>The Falcons’ move represents a stroke of genius. Sarkisian achieved tremendous success at USC, under Pete Carroll’s regime, and then as the head coach for the University of Washington. He also was quarterbacks coach of the Oakland Raiders in 2004.</p>
<p>The 42-year-old Sarkisian isn’t dissimilar from Shanahan. Both are young, swashbuckling play-callers well liked by quarterbacks for their ability to adjust to personnel and willingness to trust signal-callers. </p>
<p>One thing that helped Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan earn MVP honors this year while amassing the fifth-best single-season quarterback rating in NFL history was his movement outside the pocket ― something he rarely did before his two seasons with Shanahan. We can expect Sarkisian ― who will be Ryan’s fourth OC in 10 years ― to deploy similar concepts, but with his own twist.</p>
<p>After assuming a winless Washington Huskies program in 2009, Sarkisian led UW to five wins during his first season. Then, in his second year, he became bowl eligible with seven wins. In his fourth year, he won nine games, the school’s best record in 14 seasons.</p>
<p>When USC hired then him as head coach, Sarkisian assembled one of the nation’s elite recruiting classes. </p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, however, in October 2015, then-Trojans athletic director Pat Haden fired him after Sarkisian appeared intoxicated during a pep rally speech. Eventually, Sarkisian checked into rehab and sued the school for firing him. The case was settled privately in arbitration.</p>
<p>Positivity, culture and brotherhood reign supreme for the Falcons franchise ― traits that Sarkisian embraces. He’s a brilliant offensive mind ― one who appreciates the art of zone-blocking and creativity as a play-caller ― and a coach who endeared himself to former players despite his issues. </p>
<p>Falcons Pro Bowl cornerback Desmond Trufant played for him at UW, and has nothing but good things to say.</p>
<p>“That’s my guy,” Trufant, 26, told the Atlanta Journal Constitution. “I went through a lot with Sark during my college days. I was in his first recruiting class.</p>
<p> “He came to my house and recruited. He’s a dope guy. A very strong guy. A leader. Very passionate about the game. He definitely could get the job done.” </p>
<p> Sarkisian inherits one of the most dominating offenses in NFL history with a quarterback dead-smack in his prime. He also has superstar Julio Jones ― arguably the greatest wide receiver of his generation, an upper echelon offensive line, and an elite running back tandem DeVonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman. Falcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff and head coach Dan Quinn anticipated for weeks that Shanahan was likely on his way out.  “I know what he stands for as a coach,” Quinn said of Sarkisian at a press conference. “Through the years we had a good connection.” Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com, ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report. </p>

<p>Airbnb took subtle, but critical aim at President Donald Trump’s executive order barring the entry of refugees and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries during the Super Bowl on Sunday.</p>
<p>In a 30-second advertising campaign called #weaccept, the rental giant had a simple message for viewers, played over the changing faces of people from different minority groups: “We believe no matter who you are, where you’re from, who you love or who you worship, we all belong. The world is more beautiful the more you accept.”</p>
<p>The ad was a clear commentary on the ongoing turmoil around the Trump administration’s immigration ban, which just days earlier had been temporarily halted by a federal judge in Seattle.</p>
<p>In a message posted to the Airbnb website on Sunday, the company’s founders pointed to the ongoing refugee crisis, describing the urgent need the help millions of displaced people “in need of a place to belong.”</p>
<p> “We know this is an idealistic notion that faces huge obstacles because of something that also seems simple, but isn’t - that not everyone is accepted. People who’ve been displaced, whether because of war or conflict or other factors, are acutely vulnerable to not being accepted,” the founders, Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, wrote. “They are, quite literally, in need of a place to belong, which is why we’ve been inspired to take action.”</p>
<p>On Twitter, Chesky, the CEO of Airbnb, said the company would also contribute $4 million over the next four years to the International Rescue Committee, a relief agency for refugees. </p>
<p>Shortly after Trump signed his executive order last week, Chesky sent a memo to Airbnb employees expressing his opposition to the ban, which he called “a policy that I profoundly disagree with ... a direct obstacle to our mission at Airbnb.”</p>
<p>The company garnered widespread support for the Super Bowl spot on social media during the game. Former Secretary of State John Kerry called it “leadership that’s needed!” and former Attorney General Eric Holder said it represented “who we truly are.”</p>
<p>In the letter published Sunday, Airbnb’s founders addressed criticism that its platform can allow hosts to discriminate against users. The company adopted new policies in September to address those fears, and affirmed it was still working towards inclusion and “these efforts are just the beginning.”</p>
<p>“The painful truth is that guests on Airbnb have experienced discrimination, something that is the very opposite of our values,” they wrote. “We know we have work to do and are dedicated to achieving greater acceptance in our community.”</p>

<p>The New England Patriots’ Julian Edelman pulled off one of the most remarkable catches in Super Bowl history on Sunday when he bobbled a 23-yard pass multiple times with three defenders around him before securing the ball.</p>
<p>The play came with just 2:22 left in the fourth quarter and the Patriots down 20-28. Later on the same drive, the team scored a touchdown and completed a two-point conversion, pushing the game to overtime, where they won on a game-winning drive. </p>

<p>Tom Brady won this Super Bowl for his mom.</p>
<p>Amid celebration of the New England Patriots’ miraculous comeback victory on Sunday, Patriots owner Robert Kraft revealed that Brady’s mother has been battling an undisclosed form of cancer for the past 18 months.</p>
<p>“I spoke to him in the locker room before the game, and I said, ‘We gotta win this one for your mom,’ because I know how important his mom is,” Kraft told NESN. “She’s been going through chemotherapy and radiation, and this is the first game she’s been to. She came here, and I just saw her, and it was really cool.”</p>
<p>Galynn Brady had been absent from all of her son’s games this season because of the illness. Brady told reporters before the game that he was playing for his mother.</p>
<p>“She’s the one I want to win it for,” Brady said.</p>
<p>Family and support emerged as a theme for Brady, now the winningest Super Bowl quarterback of all time, leading up to the game on Sunday. In addition to speaking about his loved ones in interviews, he shared a photo with them on Instagram alongside the caption, “It takes a team.”</p>
<p>Brady and the Patriots pulled off a stunning comeback, overcoming a 28-3 deficit to beat the Atlanta Falcons 34-28 in overtime. </p>
<p>“It was just awesome,” Brady’s father, Tom Brady Sr., told Sports Illustrated’s MMQB. “He puts everything he can into every single game. But this one, I heard he just said, ‘I’m winning this one for my mom.’ That one jerks the tear ducts big-time. … She lives and dies with every one of her children, whether it’s in a football game or anything else. And she was very thankful. Very thankful, yeah, just very thankful that this played out.”</p>

<p>“It was right here. I know exactly where I put it,” he told security staff and team equipment managers, according to sports reporter Martin Rogers. </p>
<p>The NFL tweeted out a clip of Brady speaking with Patriots’ owner Robert Kraft, where he he can be heard saying “someone stole my game jersey.”</p>

<p>North Carolina could lose NCAA sporting events for the next six years if its legislature fails to repeal a controversial anti-LGBTQ law passed last year, sports officials in the state warned in a letter to lawmakers on Monday.</p>
<p>The law in question ― known as HB2 ― barred cities and localities from enacting laws to protect people from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity and required that students at North Carolina schools use bathrooms that match their gender assignment at birth, rather than their gender identity.</p>
<p>The law has already cost the state dearly: Last year, the NBA moved the 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte, while the NCAA and Atlantic Coast Conference relocated sporting events out of the state.</p>
<p>The failure to repeal HB2 could compound those losses in the coming days, according to the North Carolina Sports Association, a nonprofit organization whose “purpose is to grow, promote and enhance the general welfare of the sports industry in North Carolina.”</p>
<p>The NCAA, the state association said in a Monday letter addressed to North Carolina lawmakers, is currently evaluating bids for future postseason events. The letter states that the NCAA has told the association that “due to their stance on HB2, all North Carolina bids will be pulled from the review process and removed from consideration.”</p>
<p>Further, the letter warns, the NCAA could pull any postseason events scheduled for 2017-2018 from the state. (The NCAA’s original decision only affected the current academic year.) North Carolina cities and schools, the letter says, have submitted a total of 133 bids to host various NCAA sporting events between now and 2022.</p>
<p>“North Carolina is on the brink of losing all NCAA Championship events for six consecutive years,” the letter states. “Our window to act is closing rapidly. ... Our last chance to save these events is now.”</p>
<p>The letter was signed by Scott Dupree, the executive director of the Greater Raleigh Sports Alliance and a member of the North Carolina Sports Association.</p>
<p>“I wrote the letter as a member of the North Carolina Sports Association, and with the approval of its board of directors, in order to provide our legislators in the General Assembly with the most up-to-date information in regard to the NCAA’s ongoing bid process, which is winding down,” Dupree said in an email statement. “I wanted to make sure our legislators were aware of the timeline and the potential economic losses for our state, and thus the urgency of the situation.”</p>
<p>Gov. Roy Cooper’s (D) victory in November’s election seemed to signal the end of HB2, and the state legislature considered repealing it during a December special session. But a compromise between Democrats and Republicans fell apart, leaving the law on the books.</p>
<p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has expressed a desire to bring the All-Star Game back to Charlotte, but the league has said it will not do so as long as HB2 remains law. </p>
<p>The NCAA moved seven total events from North Carolina ― including men’s NCAA Tournament games and Division I championships for women’s soccer, women’s lacrosse and women’s golf ― in September. The ACC relocated its 2016 football championship from Charlotte to Orlando, Florida, and also moved the upcoming women’s basketball conference tournament out of the state.</p>
<p>“The NCAA decided in September to remove championships from North Carolina for the 2016-17 season, and it has not yet determined future championship sites,” an NCAA spokesperson said in an email Monday, in response to questions about whether it had decided not to award events to North Carolina unless HB2 was repealed. “The NCAA expects to announce site selections for the 2018-19 through 2021-22 championship seasons in April.”</p>
<p>The NCAA last year required cities interested in hosting future events to “specifically outline how they will protect participants and spectators from discrimination.”</p>
<p>Duke men’s basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski has condemned the law as “embarrassing.” University of North Carolina head coach Roy Williams slammed the law on Sunday after UNC’s win in Greensboro, which was scheduled to host 2017 NCAA Tournament games this March before the NCAA moved them.</p>
<p>“I’m glad we were able to take a game here because of that stupid rule that we have in our state that took a lot of great opportunities for people in our state, and great athletes that like to do things in our state,” Williams said Sunday. “I shouldn’t say rule, I guess it’s a law. A law’s more important than a rule, I guess. But I just think that’s ridiculous, and what it’s doing to our state and the reputation of our state.”</p>

<p>You can cross off the New England Patriots’ Martellus Bennett from the guest list when his team visits the White House and President Donald Trump to celebrate its Super Bowl victory.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to go,” the tight end said in a postgame interview, following the Patriots’ historic win over the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. The team overcame a 25-point deficit, the largest in Super Bowl history. It was also the first time the big game had run into overtime.</p>
<p>Asked why, Bennett responded, “It is what it is. People know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter.”</p>
<p>Last month he’d tweeted:</p>

<p>For more than half of Super Bowl LI on Sunday night, Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan looked like the same guy that put together the best season of his career and won the NFL MVP award this year, in part because Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan was dialing up the same offense that made him the NFL’s assistant coach of the year.</p>
<p>Ryan threw two touchdowns as the Falcons sliced up the New England defense over the game’s first three quarters, pushing Atlanta to a seemingly insurmountable 28-3 lead. Even after the Patriots stormed back, Ryan engineered a drive ― with the help of an insane catch from wide receiver Julio Jones ― that took the Falcons deep into Patriots territory with just less than four minutes to play.</p>
<p>All the Falcons had to do was finish off that drive, and they didn’t even need a touchdown to do it. A field goal would almost surely have been enough to seal the first Super Bowl win in Falcons franchise history.</p>
<p>Then Ryan, Shanahan and the Falcons blew it.</p>
<p>It started on 2nd-and-11 from New England’s 23-yard line, when Ryan dropped back to pass, found himself under pressure, and inexplicably took a sack from Patriots defensive end Trey Flowers.</p>
<p>Before the 12-yard loss, the Falcons were looking, at worst, at a field goal that kicker Matt Bryant likely would have made: Bryant was 28 of 29 this season on attempts shorter than 50 yards, and had the benefit of kicking indoors. After the sack, they were on the outer bounds of his range (his season long was 53 yards), but still close enough to at least give him a chance.</p>
<p>Somehow, they managed to make the situation even worse. On third down, Ryan hit wide receiver Mohammed Sanu for a 9-yard gain that should have put the Falcons right back in Bryant’s comfort zone. But a holding penalty on lineman Jake Matthews cost them another 10 yards, and on the replayed third down, Ryan overthrew his intended target. </p>
<p>Atlanta had to punt, and New England scored a touchdown on the next drive to send the game to overtime, where the Patriots eventually won the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Ryan taking the sack is a hard mistake to stomach. But pinning it on him alone isn’t quite fair. From the New England 23, with the knowledge that a field goal would probably be enough, Shanahan could have turned to running back Devonta Freeman ― who rushed for 75 yards on just 11 carries and had 121 yards of total offense ― to eliminate the possibility of a sack and pick up whatever extra yardage they could to make the field goal attempt even easier.</p>
<p>For some reason, he chose not to, just as he decided to abandon the run on the 3rd-and-1 play that led to Ryan’s fumble ― and New England’s second touchdown ― earlier in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>To say that any football game rests on one or two plays is to oversimplify the sport. The Falcons could have, at any point, come up with a score that would have kept the game out of New England’s reach, or stopped the Patriots offense from racking up all sorts of Super Bowl records during their comeback. Bryant, of course, might have missed the kick. And maybe on another night, Julian Edelman doesn’t pull off one of the greatest catches in Super Bowl history to extend the Patriots’ game-tying drive.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to overstate how simple a task the Falcons had in front of them, and how badly they botched it.</p>
<p>At one point in the third quarter, the Falcons had a 99.6 probability of winning the Super Bowl, according to ESPN’s win probability measure. A field goal on the drive in question would have given them a two-score lead with about three minutes to play ― all but ensuring they’d win. But they didn’t, because they couldn’t avoid going backward on two straight plays, and gave New England quarterback Tom Brady the ball and a final chance to tie the game.</p>
<p>The Falcons had a fantastic season, and Ryan and Shanahan are as big a reason as any that they ended up in the Super Bowl in the first place. That season wasn’t capped with the franchise’s first Super Bowl title, though, because of their inexplicable failure to close out a fourth quarter drive that will be hard for them, or Falcons fans, to forget for a long time.</p>

<p>It’s a sure bet that tennis star Eugenie Bouchard won’t make any more Super Bowl wagers with Twitter followers.</p>
<p>When the Atlanta Falcons were up by 21 points during the first half Sunday, the 22-year-old Canadian posted a tweet in support of the Dirty Birds.</p>
<p>One of her Twitter followers, John Goerhke, wasn’t willing to follow her down that particular path and challenged her to a friendly Super Bowl bet.</p>
<p>Figuring the odds of anyone, even the Patriots, coming back from such a huge deficit would be unlikely, Bouchard agreed to the bet.</p>
<p>But Goehrke, a 20-year-old marketing major at the University of Missouri, had a feeling Tom Brady would find a way to come back.</p>
<p>“I saw the tweet and I’m like, I wasn’t assuming the game was over because I knew how good the Patriots were and how good Tom Brady was, but I was like, I don’t think this is over,” Goehrke told The Chicago Tribune. “I thought it would be funny to comment something just to say whatever, like, ‘You’re crazy if you think this is over.’ ... But then I thought I could have more fun with it and do something else, so I thought of that.”</p>
<p>Bouchard’s reactions as the Patriots came back and she realized she might possibly be going on a date with a stranger were immortalized on her Twitter page.</p>
<p>First she got embarrassed.</p>
<p>Then she freaked out.</p>
<p>Then she became pragmatic.</p>
<p>Then she became philosophical.</p>
<p>Bouchard was still processing the loss on Monday morning.</p>
<p>But Bouchard is a woman of honor and said she would stand by the bet she made with Goehrke.</p>
<p>Goehrke is still waiting for Bouchard’s reps to contact him to set up a date. He’s also scoping out Chicago hot spots she might enjoy.</p>
<p>“Honestly, if I’m even lucky enough for it to happen and I meet her, that would be good enough,” he told The Chicago Tribune. “Depending on where she wants to meet or what she wants to do, I’m going to try to take her to dinner. See what happens.”</p>
<p>Whether it works out to be a love match for the tennis star remains to be seen. She has been linked to Jordan Caron, a hockey player in the Boston Bruins system, according to HockeyFeed.com.</p>

<p>HOUSTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - From U.S. President Donald Trump to the Pope, the world was settling in for a rousing Super Bowl Sunday with the Atlanta Falcons taking on the New England Patriots in an NFL title game that will be played with deep political undertones.</p>
<p>President Trump will kick off the pre-game buildup with a television interview while Vice-President Mike Pence will be among the estimated 73,000 fans packing NRG Stadium.</p>
<p>A worldwide television audience and upwards of 180 millions Americans are also expected to be huddled around their televisions to watch United States’ biggest sporting spectacle that could be equal parts patriotism and protest.</p>
<p>While there will be no shortage of flag-waving patriotic pageantry around the game there were also protests, with reports of close to 500 demonstrators gathering at a park nearly two miles (3.2 kilometers) from the stadium with plans to march on the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The FBI and the Joint Information Center confirmed to Reuters they are aware of the protest in Hermann Park and were monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>“They will be around to protest and exercise their first amendment right as long as it doesn’t interfere with any security operations,” Victor Senators, spokesman for the Joint Information Center, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The halftime show featuring outspoken singer Lady Gaga could also be a potential flashpoint.</p>
<p>An advocate for LGBT rights and a champion for inclusion, Lady Gaga’s 13-minute concert has generated tremendous speculation over whether she might use the Super Bowl stage to deliver a rebuttal to U.S. President Trump’s controversial appointments and policies, including travel restrictions targeting seven Muslim-majority nations.</p>
<p>Though American football is one of the world’s most violent sports, Pope Francis invoked an historic blessing on the Super Bowl for the first time, saying the game could be an agent for peace.</p>
<p>“Great sporting events like today’s Super Bowl are highly symbolic, showing that it is possible to build a culture of encounter and a world of peace,” said the Pope in his Sunday address.</p>
<p>“By participating in sport, we are able to go beyond our own self-interest and in a healthy way we learn to sacrifice, to grow in fidelity and respect the rules.</p>
<p>“May this year’s Super Bowl be a sign of peace, friendship and solidarity for the world.”</p>
<p>The reality of a dangerous world, however, was reflected in the heavy security around NRG Stadium where the Falcons, led by their newly-minted NFL most valuable player quarterback Matt Ryan, will try to remove their name from a list of teams never to have won a Super Bowl while the Patriots seek to confirm their status as a dynasty by claiming their fifth title in 16 seasons and second in the last three.</p>
<p>Federal, State local police and private security surrounded NRG Stadium while airplanes, helicopters and drones kept watch overhead.</p>
<p>On the ground bomb sniffing dogs were hard at work as thousands of fans patiently made their way through airport-style screening.</p>

<p>More than 100 million Americans will likely spend Sunday night watching the Super Bowl. Although it is not quite the same as a FIFA World Cup Final – which had one billion viewers worldwide in 2014 – the Super Bowl is still a big deal in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>And before the game many will ask a simple question.</p>
<p>Who is going to win?</p>
<p>Bill Barnwell of ESPN.com almost wrote a book on the topic, offering more than 6500 words trying to answer this question. Many other “experts” have also offered their thoughts and many more will continue to try. But is it possible to really know?</p>
<p>As an economist, I am inclined to begin by looking at how much teams spend on players. One might expect the team that spends the most on players has better players, and therefore more likely to win the game. In 2016, the Atlanta Falcons spent more on players than the New England Patriots. So are the Falcons favored?</p>
<p>Looking at payroll data from 2000 to 2015 we don’t see much evidence this is true. Across these 16 seasons, the team with the highest payroll in the Super Bowl only won eight times. And that means the team with the highest payroll lost eight times. So payroll really doesn’t tell us who is going to win.</p>
<p>What about wins in the regular season? It should be the case that teams that win more in the regular season are the better team. And since the Patriots won 14 games in the regular season while the Falcons only won 11, New England should be favored. But again, the data in this century doesn’t tell that story. From 2000 to 2015, 13 times one Super Bowl team won more games than the other during the regular season. But only four times did the team with the most wins manage to win the big game.</p>
<p>Okay, what about the team with the best defense. Many people think defense wins titles, and the Patriots had a better defense than the Falcons in the regular season. But in the 21 century, the team with the best defense won the Super Bowl eight times. And again, that means they lost eight times. And before you ask… the story for “best offense” isn’t much different. The Falcons have the best offense in this game. But the team with the best offense has only won seven of the 16 Super Bowls this century.</p>
<p>What about point differential? Perhaps the issue is how many more points a team scores above what it surrenders. The Patriots outscored their opponents by 191 points in 2016 while the Falcons only outscored their opponents by just 134 points. However, in the 21 century the team with the best point differential has won eight times. Yes, that means the team with the best differential lost eight times.</p>
<p>Okay, nothing obvious seems to tell us what we want to know. But what if we look at something not-so-obvious?</p>
<p>A few years ago, Jennifer VanGilder (of Ursinus College), Rob Simmons (of Lancaster University) and I looked at how physical attractiveness of quarterbacks impacted their wages. We found that quarterbacks that had more symmetrical faces (which is a method plastic surgeons use to measure beauty) were paid higher wages, even after we controlled for the quarterback’s performance (and other characteristics). In sum – as our academic article indicated ― quarterbacks who literally “looked good” saw more dollars in their paychecks.</p>
<p>So looks get you paid. But can attractiveness help you win?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>But just for fun, I thought it would be interesting to see if there was any pattern in the data. So Jennifer VanGilder collected symmetry scores on each quarterback that appeared in the Super Bowl since 2001. And what she found is that teams that had the better looking quarterback won 13 times!</p>
<p>Yes, none of the obvious factors tell us anything this century. But teams with the more attractive quarterback won 81 percent of the time.</p>
<p>So who is better looking, Matt Ryan or Tom Brady? Tom Brady is famous for his looks. But as NFL Films noted, Matt Ryan had the most symmetrical face in our sample.</p>
<p>So does that mean the Falcons can ride Ryan’s good looks to victory?</p>
<p>Again, this story is difficult to believe. Yes, there is a pattern in the data. But for us to infer a causal relationship we need a theory. What could be the theoretical reason for this outcome? Hard to think of what this might be.</p>
<p>A more plausible explanation is that this is just a great example of a correlation without causation. As Popular Science detailed two years ago, Tyler Vigan created a program called Spurious Correlations. This program searched data sets to discover odd correlations. One great example is that mozzarella cheese consumption had a 95 percent correlation with the number of civil engineering doctorates earned. </p>
<p>Yes, correlation doesn’t mean causation. And one suspects that better looking quarterbacks winning Super Bowls is a similar story.</p>
<p>So what predicts the winner of the Super Bowl? I would argue – despite all the efforts made by “experts” – that there isn’t much that allows us to know the winner before the game is played.</p>
<p>In the end, football is very resistant to prediction. To illustrate, team payroll from 2000 to 2016 explains less than three percent of the variation in regular season wins. Yes, more spending doesn’t really lead to more wins. And this is because it is hard for NFL decision-makers – the “experts” paid by teams – to know which players are going to be good or bad before the season starts.</p>
<p>One obvious problem is the unpredictability of turnovers. We know turnovers predict outcomes. But as Brian Burke and I noted in 2011, both interceptions and fumbles are essentially impossible to predict.</p>
<p>So does that mean we have no idea who is going to win? Well, Joshua Pitts published an extensive study that indicated that passing – both the ability to throw the ball and the ability to defend the pass – does seem to have some ability to predict postseason success. Unfortunately, that really doesn’t help us much here. Atlanta does have a better passing offense. But New England has a better pass defense.</p>
<p>And that means if we wish to predict the outcome, it doesn’t look good. Unless we wish to just go with a silly theory that being good looking all you really need. If that is all you need… Well, Matt Ryan will look good on Sunday night. But I remain skeptical that this will mean the Falcons are definitely going to win.</p>

<p>Husain Abdullah didn’t find out that President Donald Trump had signed an executive order temporarily banning refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries until Saturday morning, when a friend posted a video of protesters at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport to Snapchat.</p>
<p>The night before, Abdullah ― a practicing Muslim who played seven seasons as an NFL free safety before he retired in 2016 ― had been consumed with preparing for a trip to Rwanda with a group of his fellow graduate students at Southern Methodist University. But when he saw the video, he instantly hopped online to figure out what was going on. He didn’t like what he saw.</p>
<p>“When it comes to what’s going on socially, he’s spread a lot of hate,” Abdullah said of Trump on Friday. “Yes, we have to have immigration laws, but everyone has to be subject to the same laws. When you start to discriminate against people based on their religion, that becomes a huge issue.”</p>
<p>Abdullah and his brother Hamza, also a former NFL player, are two of the most prominent Muslims to have played professional football. Their faith became a well-known aspect of their careers in 2012, when they skipped the NFL season to make a religious pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>
<p>Trump has argued that his order doesn’t specifically single out Muslims. But Abdullah doesn’t buy it, especially after a campaign in which Trump “targeted quite a few people” ― including Mexican and Latino immigrants, women, African-Americans and people with disabilities.</p>
<p>“Absolutely, Muslims are being targeted,” Abdullah said. “There will be other groups targeted as well. It’s only going to get worse if people don’t stand up and they don’t protest, and we don’t have lawyers working and politicians working to block these orders and to slow these things down. If everybody just says this is the way it is, it’s going to get ugly real quick.”</p>
<p>That responsibility, Abdullah said, also extends to the NFL. Some players have spoken out, but Commissioner Roger Goodell chose not to. Asked about Trump’s executive order at a news conference Wednesday, Goodell said that he is “singularly focused on the Super Bowl.”</p>
<p>“Knowing how the NFL operates, they just want to stay as clean as they can,” Abdullah said. “They don’t want to talk about anything other than football. They tell all of us, just football. Nothing else. Anything other than football is labeled a distraction. The reality is, if there’s a social issue plaguing the country and now plaguing the globe ... we need these giant organizations and people who are running them to speak up on it.”</p>
<p>Goodell’s reticence to comment, Abdullah said, creates a dynamic in which players are less likely to speak out. </p>
<p>“When the NFL does something like that ― ‘oh, we’re not worried about that; we’re just focused on football’ ― now for everybody who’s Muslim or everybody who probably doesn’t share the majority religious opinion, now they’re more than likely [thinking], ‘Man, if I say something, then now they’re going to single me out, or they’re going to target me,’” he said. “They have to do a better job of paying attention to what’s going on socially. And not only how it affects America or society at large, but also how it affects their players.”</p>
<p>Abdullah, who retired after suffering the fifth concussion of his career last season, is pursuing a master’s in dispute resolution and conflict management at SMU in Dallas. In March, he’ll travel to Rwanda to work with a school for orphans.</p>
<p>And while he knows many people are fearful of Trump’s policies, recent events have only hardened his resolve to pursue a field that will allow him to help people. </p>
<p>“I’m feeling a sense of urgency, in a positive way. Not out of fear, but just in a positive way,” Abdullah said. “Emotions ... can either paralyze you and you can fall into depression and despair and worry, or you can channel the emotion, whether it’s good or bad, and you can use it for a positive cause.”</p>
<p>“Football was purposeful. I was passionate about it. Now, with what’s going on right now, this is my purpose. This is my passion. I just have a sense of urgency to be a product of change for the better.”</p>

<p>All you cord-cutters who are hoping to have friends over for the Super Bowl on Sunday need not worry: Super Bowl LI will be incredibly easy to stream without a cable subscription this year. </p>
<p>The game will stream live on foxsportsgo.com and all the related FOX Sports GO apps this year, the network announced earlier this month. That means whether you’re using a Apple TV, Roku, Android TV, Chromecast, Amazon Fire, Xbox One, or even your trusty laptop, you should be good to go so long as your up to date on, well, updates. Go here the day of the game to watch from a computer.</p>
<p>Better yet, you don’t even have to borrow your mom and dad’s cable subscription to get the stream, as the network isn’t requiring people to use their pay TV credentials to watch the game, the network said. </p>
<p>“As part of the buildup to this year’s Super Bowl, we’re committed to creating the best possible experience for fans by dramatically expanding the ways and places in which they can watch the game,” Eric Shanks, the FOX Sports president, COO and executive producer, said in a statement.</p>
<p>In the past, some of these streams haven’t shown what a lot of viewers actually want to see: the commercials. But this year, that won’t be the case. The live stream is going to show all the national ads, too, so you’ll get to see whatever this year’s version of the puppy monkey baby will be. </p>
<p>The game starts at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday by the way. </p>

<p>DeAndre Hopkins of the Houston Texans is one of the NFL’s elite wide receivers by just about any metric. In 2015, the former Clemson standout accumulated 111 catches, 1,521 yards and 11 touchdowns while earning second-team All-Pro honors. This past season, however, the 24-year-old struggled, in large part because of the errant quarterback play of Brock Osweiler.</p>
<p>As Super Bowl LI ― set for Sunday in Houston’s NRG Stadium ― approaches, Hopkins (promoting Gatorade’s new Gx platform), discusses watching other teams prepare for the big game, his frustrations from the past season and why he believes the Texans are on the right path to championship contention.</p>
<p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>
<p>What have you learned and appreciated while hosting the Super Bowl festivities in Houston?</p>
<p>It’s bittersweet. You know, I wish I was in that game. That Patriots [playoff] game is still in my head. Knowing how close we were, I feel like we gave those guys the best challenge of anybody. It’s tough, man, to watch two other teams in your locker room.</p>
<p>Now that we’re a few weeks removed from your playoff loss to the Patriots, have you spoken with teammates about what went wrong and how close you were? </p>
<p>Of course we have, and that’s why we’re working this offseason ― the team, the energy, the mindset that we have is different. Because we know what it takes, we know if we play one better half of football, what could have been. This team ― we’re not making any excuses this year for anything, like we did last year without having [first-team All-Pro defensive end J.J. Watt], still being the No. 1 defense. Or our offense playing like we did and us still being able to win games. It’s right there man ― we know it. The sky is the limit.</p>
<p>Lamar Miller was very good this year at running back. Did that surprise you?</p>
<p>Nah, I wasn’t surprised at all. I knew Lamar Miller was going to do that. The year before he came here, when he played in Miami, he had like an 80-yard something run on us up the middle. It’s not every day you see a guy be able to run up the middle and score a touchdown. So once we got him, that play stuck in my head.  </p>
<p>You had an outstanding 2015 campaign, but this season you didn’t generate the same level of production. Obviously Brock Osweiler struggled, but I can imagine you want to continue growing as a player?</p>
<p>Of course I want to continue growing as a player, but in some positions, not like others, your play is dictated by others’ play. If there’s anything I need to work on this offseason, it’s with the guy who’s going to be throwing me the football. </p>
<p>Does that mean you’ll be in Houston working out with Osweiler? </p>
<p>I’ll be in Houston working out. [I’ll be working] with the guy who’s going to be throwing me the football.</p>

<p>The 2016-2017 season was perhaps among the most openly political years in NFL history, as Colin Kaepernick’s protest of the national anthem, Tom Brady’s tacit support for Donald Trump, players’ reactions to Trump’s victory, and even the election’s potential effects on the NFL ratings dominated headlines.</p>
<p>But during the final week of such a tumultuous season, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell chose to say nothing when politics came up at his annual pre-Super Bowl news conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“As commissioner of the NFL, I’m singularly focused on the Super Bowl right now,” Goodell told a reporter when asked for his thoughts on the executive order President Donald Trump signed Friday to temporarily ban refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. “We have a unique position to have an event on Sunday that will bring the world together.”</p>
<p>When Goodell announced that next season the NFL would once again play a game in Mexico City, a Hispanic reporter asked what the NFL could do “to help build a better relationship between Mexico and the U.S., and not necessarily build other things” ― a not-so-subtle reference to Trump’s plans to erect a wall along the southern border. Goodell chuckled, but avoided any comment on the wall.</p>
<p>“One of the things that we truly believe in our hearts is that the NFL really does bond communities together and can be a bridge in that way,” Goodell said. “It unites people. We’re going to see it this weekend with the Super Bowl, where millions of people are going to tune in and they’re going to celebrate and they’re going to all forget about other things for at least a short period of time and really focus on having fun and being entertained by the Super Bowl.”</p>
<p>Given the year the NFL has had and everything going on around him, Goodell’s unwillingness to even remotely address the issues at the forefront of seemingly everyone’s minds was striking — and possibly revealing.</p>
<p>It started in the preseason, when Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, refused to stand for the national anthem to protest racism and police killings of African Americans. His protest continued throughout the season, and players across the league and in other sports joined him. Many of Kaepernick’s actions ― he wore a Fidel Castro shirt; he denounced both Trump and Hillary Clinton; he didn’t vote ― sparked repeated rounds of political discussion inside and around football. In November, a group of NFL players visited Congress to discuss police brutality and race relations with lawmakers. In week 13, the league allowed players to dedicate their cleats to charitable causes ― many of which were inherently political.</p>
<p>Patriots quarterback Tom Brady made his own statement when reporters noticed a “Make America Great Again” hat in his locker. Though Brady shied away from talking about politics after that, Trump, who has referred to him as a “friend,” didn’t: At a late campaign rally in New Hampshire, Trump touted Brady’s support and read a letter he received from Patriots coach Bill Belichick (Patriots owner Bob Kraft, too, is a friend and possible supporter of Trump). And New York Jets owner Woody Johnson served on Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, before last month accepting an ambassadorship representing the Trump administration.</p>
<p>The aura of politics hasn’t lifted just because it’s Super Bowl week, for obvious reasons. Border politics are a major issue across Texas, and the refugee ban is a specific concern in Houston: As SBNation observed this week, Houston is “a haven for refugees” — no American city welcomes more each year, a fact that has helped make Houston one of America’s most diverse cities.</p>
<p>As the NFL’s celebrations kicked off Monday, demonstrators rallied against Trump’s immigration policies outside the Super Bowl media center. Inside, it remained an issue on the minds of players and the media. Falcons owner Arthur Blank criticized Trump, while reporters badgered Brady and Belichick about the president (neither really said anything). A number of players said they would speak out on the order and other political issues after the game. Martellus Bennett, the Patriots tight end, said he won’t visit the White House if New England wins Sunday. Goodell, incidentally, said he had no knowledge of mentions of Trump disappearing from post-media day transcripts.</p>
<p>Goodell’s silence on controversial issues is, ultimately, misleading. He and his league, whether they like to admit it or not, have always been political. The NFL has its own political action committee and has spent millions lobbying Congress. It begs voters to throw hundreds of millions in taxpayer money toward new stadiums. And as much as Goodell tried to root his personal opposition to Kaepernick’s protest in an appeal to patriotism, his and his league’s open embrace of that ideal — often in the form of unquestioned deference to law enforcement and the military — is itself a political position.</p>
<p>This season and the actions players took during it should finally bury the idea that the NFL is disconnected from politics. “Political issues” such as police brutality and refugee bans and even the outcomes of elections affect its players and teams and the communities they are a part of. Goodell seems to believe he can only achieve his goals — $25 billion in annual revenue by 2027, and further growth internationally — by staying mum on divisive political issues and uniting people in their desire to consume more football (NFL regular season ratings, likely affected by an all-consuming presidential election, dropped 8 percent from a year ago). But in an era of newfound athlete activism, it was unrealistic to think NFL players, coaches and teams (and the media that covers them) wouldn’t eventually begin to speak out.</p>
<p>The NFL, and Goodell, love to talk about how “football is family” — presumably for everyone. But sitting atop a league that has become more outspoken, in a city home to so many people who now feel more vulnerable than ever, Roger Goodell used his platform to stick to sports. The refugees and immigrants in the city hosting his Super Bowl don’t have that privilege.</p>

<p>Media day has come and gone for both the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons, which means we can finally stop worrying about the sideshow frenzy and start focusing on the actual game itself: Super Bowl LI.</p>
<p>According to the betting folks in the desert, New England is a 3-point favorite. The Pats, after all, haven’t lost since before Thanksgiving, and quarterback Tom Brady just completed the single greatest touchdown-interception ratio for a season in NFL history.</p>
<p>Atlanta, one could argue, is playing just as well, having won six straight games and accumulating points at a nearly unheard-of rate. (Don’t say we didn’t warn you!) Quarterback Matt Ryan is the likely MVP and finished the regular season with the best passer rating in football ― a healthy 117.1. To put that number in perspective, consider that it’s the fifth-best clip in league history.</p>
<p>His 38 touchdown passes trailed only Aaron Rodgers, whom he completely outperformed in the NFC Championship, while he also led the league in total quarterback rating (83.3) and yards per pass attempt (9.26) ― the most in NFL history.</p>
<p>So, the game pits two teams with elite quarterbacks anchoring some of pro football’s most powerful offenses. However, the Falcons, as I’ve chronicled, have a vastly improving defense, which undoubtedly will come in handy on Sunday. </p>
<p>And Brady’s weaknesses may help the Dirty Birds bring the first-ever Super Bowl win to Atlanta. (It will also be the city’s first pro sports championship since the 1995 Braves won the World Series.)</p>
<p>While every quarterback hates to be hit, Brady might just hate it the most. In three of his Super Bowl appearances, he’s been sacked at least twice ― and the Patriots lost two of those. So, keeping him upright and comfortable in the pocket is paramount.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the Falcons, they have an assortment of different ways to get to Brady. The most obvious choice is the league’s sack leader, first-team All-Pro selection Vic Beasley Jr. However, Beasley has failed to record a single quarterback hit or sack in the playoffs. In other words, he’s a great player, but he’s not Von Miller. </p>
<p>A Beasley spark would be enormously helpful for Atlanta, but two areas where Dan Quinn’s defense may also have success getting after Brady are its linebackers and secondary.</p>
<p>Rookie safety Keanu Neal is a Kam Chancellor clone who runs like a gazelle and hits as solid as a lion. He leads all rookies with his five forced fumbles, and is second with his 106 tackles. Don’t be surprised to see him blitz ― and get home ― from a variety of different spots.</p>
<p>Additionally, don’t be surprised if Dwight Freeney becomes a factor. The 36-year-old is one of the greatest defensive ends ― a future first-ballot Hall of Famer ― and he was brought in last summer precisely for these moments. Expect him to make an impact rushing on crucial third downs.</p>
<p>The other area where Quinn may be creative with his blitzes is from the cornerbacks. Losing Pro Bowler Desmond Trufant for the year back in November was a killer, but second-year man Jalen Collins and rookie undrafted free agent Brian Poole have picked up the slack in coverage ― though the Patriots are a different animal. Even still, Trufant is a terrific corner blitzer. Neither Poole nor Collins have been asked to do it yet, but both are sound, physical tacklers who play bigger than their frames suggest (see below).</p>
<p>Should Quinn send one of his corners on a blitz, expect the Falcons’ defense to use more Cover 3 looks ― the style that Quinn brought from his days coordinating the Seahawks’ dominant defense. The 46-year-old head coach has shifted to more man-to-man coverage looks this year, but isn’t afraid to run zone when the situations dictates it. Brady, to be sure, is as smart as they come at identifying what the defense is doing ― especially in his pre-snap reads ― and thus is a challenging chess match for Quinn and his staff.</p>
<p>Defense, you see, has been the difference during Atlanta’s run. We can talk about Julio Jones, Ryan and the dual threat running backs all we want, but during the Falcons’ last eight games ― seven of which they’ve won ― the defense has given up only 20.5 points per matchup, totaling 17 sacks and 16 forced turnovers. </p>
<p>Expect a similar effort against Brady and the Pats, and in turn, a championship for the Falcons.</p>

<p>Here comes a penalty flag for unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>
<p>In a recently published conversation with The New York Times, President Donald Trump shared his opinion of the NFL’s handling of Deflategate and called NFL commissioner Roger Goodell a “dope,” among other choice adjectives.</p>
<p>The article, entitled “The Uncomfortable Love Affair Between Donald Trump and the New England Patriots,” takes a look at the president’s friendship with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Coach Bill Belichick, and star quarterback Tom Brady.</p>
<p>Here are Trump’s thoughts on the dealmaking that went down between Kraft and the NFL during the Deflategate debacle, including a Mitt Romney reference:</p>
<p> Kraft was under pressure, Trump explained. “He choked, just like Romney choked. He said: ‘You know what? They winked at me.’ I said, ‘Bob when you make a deal, you should have gotten it all wrapped up.’ Who ever heard of making a deal like that? Now you got this mess.” Kraft should never have trusted Goodell, he said. </p>
<p>Trump also took the opportunity to share some descriptive words about the NFL commissioner:</p>
<p> “The commissioner is a weak guy,” Trump said. “When he made the Ray Rice deal, everybody said: You’re stupid. You’re weak. And it was such a weak deal. So now he’s going overboard with their star, Brady.” He added: “The commissioner is a dope. He’s a stupid guy.” </p>
<p>Not an especially surprising point of view, considering that a year ago Trump indicated he would “fire” Goodell, if he could. </p>
<p>Asked on Wednesday about his feelings toward Trump, Goodell said that “as commissioner of the NFL, I am singularly focused on the Super Bowl right now.”</p>

<p>Luol Deng knows what it’s like to wait.</p>
<p>Born in Sudan, Deng was sent to Egypt at the age of 3 by his father, who thought he would be safer abroad as the Second Sudanese Civil War raged on at home. There, he lived in Alexandria for five years, stuck in a three-bedroom apartment with the rest of his family, waiting for something to change. </p>
<p>Finally, the day came when Deng’s family was granted political asylum by the British government. </p>
<p>Today, Deng is one of the NBA’s most prominent and respected veteran players. A forward for the Los Angeles Lakers and a two-time All-Star, Deng made a career out of tough defense, offensive versatility and a reputation as a great teammate and better man.</p>
<p>In the days since the Trump administration announced the president’s executive order ― which temporarily bars people from Sudan and six other predominantly Muslim countries, as well as political refugees, from entering the U.S. ― Deng has done something else, too: spoken up for those who can’t. </p>
<p>“I know for a lot of refugees, they can’t speak up or they can never be heard,” he said Tuesday after his team defeated the Denver Nuggets. “We never really asked to leave [our] homeland. And a lot of these people go through a lot of things that they have no control of.”</p>
<p>Luol Deng discusses the Trump administration’s Muslim ban Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, Deng said he felt for the families who were so close to entering America before the ban was enacted last week. “To really see a light at the end of the tunnel and to go toward that light and then that light is turned off is very difficult, not just individually, but for the family,” he said. </p>
<p>“I know what it feels like to wait for that opportunity to come every day.” he added. “Every day, there was always a hope that we’d get to leave tomorrow and we’d get to go somewhere.”</p>
<p>He continued, “You never knew where, but we just wanted somewhere where we could have an opportunity to make something out of [our lives].”</p>
<p>Deng emphasized that he does not consider himself a particularly political person. But as a refugee, he believes he has an obligation to speak on his experience, however difficult it may be.</p>
<p>Deng is from the city of Wau, which became part of South Sudan when the country won its independence from Sudan in 2011. South Sudan, unlike Sudan, is not one of the seven countries listed in Trump’s executive order. But that doesn’t make the issue any less personal for Deng. </p>
<p>“From what I understand, I haven’t seen a lot of refugees committing terrorist acts in this country,” he said. “And going back to the story that I said earlier, it took me five years to get the opportunity that I got. I’m sure the background check and everything was done.”</p>
<p>Deng first posted about the ban on Monday. In a tweet, he proclaimed himself a #ProudRefugee and noted that anyone who arrives in another country as a refugee is escaping the “depths of despair.”</p>
<p>“It’s important that we remember to humanize the experience of others,” he wrote. “Refugees overcome immeasurable odds, relocate across the globe, and work hard to make the best of their newfound home. Refugees are productive members of society that want for their family just as you want for yours. I stand by all refugees and migrants, of all religions, just as I stand by the policies that have historically welcomed them.”</p>

<p>It’s the week of the Super Bowl, the crown jewel of the NFL, and better yet, of professional sports.</p>
<p>In 2001, however, there was a different kind of pro football league ― a violent, tawdry circus known as the Extreme Football League, or XFL. Created by two titans of the television industry, pro wrestling magnate Vince McMahon and NBC’s Dick Ebersol, the eight-team league was everything that the NFL still tries not to be: brash, abrasive and crazy.</p>
<p>Before it was disbanded after a lone season, the XFL set a record high ― and multiple record lows ― in viewership. Players were mostly an odd collection of has-beens and never-weres, earning no more than $5,000 per week. </p>
<p>As ESPN gets set to release the new “30 for 30” documentary, “This Was The XFL,” on Feb. 2, The Huffington Post caught up with Ebersol and his son, director Charlie Ebersol, to discuss the film and why the league still resonates with sports fans despite its failure 15 years ago.</p>
<p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>
<p>Walk me through the process of creating the XFL.</p>
<p>Dick Ebersol: Vince and I had been business partners starting in 1985 for five years, and then I had taken the sports job at NBC, so I couldn’t be in a private sports enterprise simultaneously, but we had maintained a really good personal friendship. </p>
<p>So here he was, announcing a football league, and it seems interesting enough to me. He called me on the phone and I said, “I heard enough to tell you that I have some interest, because I know that we could have good fun with all this, but I need to understand better what your plan is. So don’t talk to anybody about TV.” </p>
<p>Or he definitely hadn’t talked to anybody about TV anyway. And within ― believe it or not ― I think six weeks, we had a deal to be 50-50 joint ventures.</p>
<p>Putting the on-field product aside for a moment, the XFL revolutionized the way sports were sold. </p>
<p>DE: As you’ll see in the show, the greatest thing about the league was the way that it was sold. The anticipation became so enormous that it blew us away. I’ll never forget going into the first game. </p>
<p>I actually thought that there were a lot of people out there who thought our brand of football was going to be so radically different that the linebackers ― in a defensive set ― would be allowed to have chairs to hit the quarterbacks over the head. Because, if you remember, that was the standard wrestling thing, grab a ring-side chair and go back and hit somebody over the head and supposedly knock him out. </p>
<p>I don’t think I’m wrong in telling you this: You’ll laugh your ass off, if nothing else, and it’s great fun with something that ended up being such an oversized flop. </p>
<p>The skycam ― now a staple at marquee sporting events ― was first introduced at scale by the XFL. How did that even come about?  </p>
<p>Charlie Ebersol: You know the Orange Bowl, about 15 years earlier, was the first time we’ve ever seen professionals use it during an event. The thing was when they tried to use it, the NFL the NBA said they never allow a camera to fly above the field. So when the XFL came along, the big premise of the league was that this is a league created for television.</p>
<p>Look, it proved it: Every piece of technology that was applied to the XFL is now standard. In 18 months, everyone was using that technology in the NFL, and I think that’s sort of been the definition of my father’s and Vince’s careers, that they were always the first to market this thing, and in doing so, they defined the market. When the XFL failed, it also revolutionized television broadcasting, so I weigh that against the larger picture.</p>
<p>DE: This was never anything to replace football in the fall. We were never going to run football against the NFL. So it was never looked upon as a bad business risk by anybody, it was just an enormous, you could say, fun failure.</p>
<p>Fun to be sure, but definitely a failure.</p>
<p>DE: Saturday night was then as it is now, the least-watched night of the week for network television. The networks today average not even a 2 rating on Saturday night. We would have been happy then with a 5 rating.</p>
<p>The very first [XFL] game was a 10 rating, which was higher than any Saturday night had been in more than a decade at that point. So it showed the anticipation for an interesting, new type of league. It showed players training for games as if there were Green Berets, and mortars going off on the field and everything. The public got so caught up in it, we probably ― we definitely ― over-hyped it.</p>
<p>The quality of the football also was very poor. That made it very hard to continue selling, right? </p>
<p>DE: I think enough of them would have stayed if the caliber of football was good. I figured that out by the end of the first quarter of the first game, that this was not going to work because of the quality of the football. And then it became how to shepherd this thing through the first season, knowing we would probably never get a second season. </p>
<p>Is it simple enough to assume, then, that the league would have lasted had the actual football been better?</p>
<p>CE: Absolutely. I would take this so far as to say, if they had not decided two weeks before the first game to broadcast the Vegas game and instead stuck with their original plan, which was the Orlando game ― which turned out to be like 37-34 [actually, it was 33-29] and was a barnburner with tons of touchdowns scored and violence.</p>
<p>I think that the only thing that surprised me about the XFL is that it failed. I really felt watching the XFL, and I think most fans felt watching it, “Wow, they’re doing this crazy stuff. Why the hell is the NFL not doing this?” </p>
<p>Yet even still, the league pushed so many envelopes. Was that a positive?</p>
<p>CE: The marketing was their greatest strength and their greatest weakness. They did such a good job marketing, they just didn’t market the thing they were actually going to give people. So when people tuned in and the defensemen didn’t have folding chairs to hit the offensive players with ― I think there was a certain level of disappointment among the fans.</p>
<p>I also would say that six months of the best marketing campaign, maybe, in the history of sports television [couldn’t compensate for only] one month of practice for the players to practice together.</p>
<p>DE: By the halfway point of the season, it was setting all-time lows. </p>
<p>How important was it for the XFL to establish itself as an entirely separate entity from the NFL? I mean, this was still pro football, but not what sports fans were accustomed to.</p>
<p>CE: People forget that the NFL is a juggernaut now, but in 2001, they were really suffering. The league had become restricted in terms of what players were allowed to do and the quarterback was being treated like the Shah of Iran and no one was allowed to touch him. The [XFL] wanted a [different] version of football.</p>
<p>They wanted this thing to have the bones of football, but they wanted to build out the rest of it to do something much more dynamic. They were willing to try new stuff in every single facet of the game.</p>
<p>Like the customized player names? </p>
<p>DE: Well, the names were something in theory that Vince was talking about months before the first game, but when we were about to play the first national television game, it was actually during the course of that day that those names were being created. </p>
<p>So, the beauty of anything you do with Vince is that anything is possible at any time. In fact, we’d never had lawyers between us ― that’s how trusting we’d become of each other and still are today. Nothing that I’ve ever done with Vince has been more fun than humans should be allowed. We just have this relationship.</p>
<p>One of the odder things I remember was the concept of a hot tub in the end zone full of strippers. </p>
<p>CE: The XFL was really unique in the sense that the league owned all the teams. So everybody was an employee of the XFL.</p>
<p>So, in each city, the GM had a lot of leeway because there were so many things going on at the league level, with teams having to figure out how to get people to come to games. So about halfway through the season, a mandate came down from WWE/NBC/XFL headquarters and they said, basically, “Push the marketing envelope, you can be controversial, knock yourself out.”</p>
<p>The LA GM and his marketing person came up with the idea of putting a hot tub in the end zone.</p>
<p>How was the idea received? </p>
<p>CE: It started with cheerleaders, and they went to the head cheerleader and said, “Hey, we’re going to put this out there” and she was like, “No. My cheerleaders are professional dancers, and they’re not going to do that.”</p>
<p>So they were like three days out [from the game] and didn’t know what to do, so they went to ― I swear to God, I think they went to the Spearmint Rhino ― and hired some girls to be in the hot tub. And the players didn’t know until they arrived at the game, and so a bunch of players told me later that they were like warming up and there were girls in an inflatable hot tub in one of the end zones.</p>
<p>So many things, too, that could have gone wrong and did. It always felt like the league was snakebitten.</p>
<p>DE: We just had a succession of things [and bad luck], including the second week with a huge game out in LA. The truck power failed and we lost the signal all the way across the country for like 20 minutes, and it turned out someone had forgotten to put gas in the generator. </p>
<p>CE: In the middle of the league, they changed the rules. So all of a sudden, they had motion behind the line and a bunch of other things like that. Once they got to week four or five and the ratings really slipped to historic lows, they really tried just about everything, but I think they were incredibly unlucky.</p>
<p>The league had already shown the viewers really crappy football, and the viewers weren’t going to come back ― they weren’t going to be fooled for a second time.</p>
<p>From an individual standpoint, what did you struggle with or what challenged you during the documentary production?  </p>
<p>CE: First of all, it was terrifying interviewing my father and Vince. Talking them both into doing the film was a funny shell game, which was Vince saying, “Yeah, I’ll do it if Dick does it,” and my dad saying, “I’ll do it if Vince does it,” and getting one of them to jump off the cliff first.</p>
<p>I think the bigger challenge was trying to deliver an hour-and-a-half film. Our first cut was two and a half hours long and had the same pace as the final film. We wanted the film to convey the chaotic and hair-on-fire pace which really produced the league. That pacing of one thing after another after was an important choice for me, but it meant that we had to cut a lot of stuff out.</p>
<p>As a whole, how rewarding was making this documentary for you? </p>
<p>DE: The best thing about this show, other than having lived that part of my life, is that my son produced and directed it. Of all the things I’ve ever done in my career, there’s nothing I’m as proud of than seeing what he pulled off with this, because this is really first-rate entertainment and I’m overwhelmed that ESPN is as supportive of this as they are ― because I competed against ESPN for a very long time.</p>

<p>A sportswriter for the New York Post claims that he was fired on Friday because of an anti-Trump tweet.</p>
<p>Bart Hubbuch, a columnist and NFL reporter for the paper, posted a new tweet on Monday with his explanation for his sudden termination:</p>
<p> Last Friday, I was fired by the New York Post for tweeting on my own time seven days earlier my personal belief that Donald Trump becoming President of the United States is a national tragedy. </p>
<p>The tweet that led to his dismissal appeared on the day of Trump’s inauguration. It compared that event with two of the worst days in American history: the attacks on Pearl Harbor and the World Trade Center.</p>
<p>Hubbuch has since deleted the tweet, but a screengrab appears below:</p>
<p>Hubbuch later sent out an apology tweet, also since deleted, calling the comparison of Trump’s inauguration to 9/11 “insensitive and wrong.” He added, “I shouldn’t have done it,” according to Philly.com.</p>
<p>Contacted by The Huffington Post, Hubbuch declined to comment further. “Unfortunately, I can’t say anything more than my pinned tweet at this time.”</p>
<p>The New York Post confirmed that Hubbuch was no longer employed there in a statement to ProFootballTalk.com. The statement suggested that the sportswriter’s tweet was not the sole reason for the paper’s decision:</p>
<p> “We expect our reporters to interact with the public, including on social media, in a professional manner,” the Post said in a statement sent to PFT. “Unfortunately, Mr. Hubbuch has engaged in a pattern of unprofessional conduct and exhibited serious lack of judgment, including most recently showing disrespect for the victims of Pearl Harbor and 9/11.” </p>
<p>Back in September, Hubbuch temporarily deleted his Twitter account due to backlash over another post, according to AwfulAnnoucing.com. The earlier tweet said, “Totally not-shocking fact: The Patriots have never had a black QB start a game in their 57-year history. Jacoby Brissett would be the first.”</p>
<p>The New York Post is owned by News Corporation, the same company that owns Fox News. Founder Rupert Murdoch reportedly has close ties to Trump.</p>

<p>At some point during Super Bowl LI on Sunday, Anheuser-Busch will run an ad that tells the story of a man fulfilling his American dream in spite of the anti-immigrant sentiment he faced along the way. </p>
<p>In the ad, released online Tuesday, a German immigrant arrives by boat in the U.S., where he is told, “You’re not wanted here. Go back home.” In spite of the xenophobia, he continues on, finally arriving in St. Louis, where he tells a man of his dream of starting an American brewing company.</p>
<p>The story, you probably guessed, is the story of the company’s co-founder, Adolphus Busch, who journeyed as a young man from Germany to St. Louis in 1857. One of more than 20 siblings, Busch went to the U.S. to try and make a life for himself, believing he would not obtain enough of his wealthy parents’ fortune. </p>
<p>The ad comes just days after President Trump signed an executive order that temporarily banned refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the country, and indefinitely banned Syrian refugees.</p>
<p>In light of the ban, it seems that Anheuser-Busch is trying to do what it can to avoid antagonizing either side of the political fray. In a statement provided to The Huffington Post, the company emphasized that the idea had been in development for a year ― well before President Donald Trump’s election ― and that it was simply meant to celebrate an American success story.</p>
<p>“We created the Budweiser commercial to highlight the ambition of our founder, Adolphus Busch, and his unrelenting pursuit of the American dream,” the company said in a statement. </p>
<p>Ricardo Marques, an executive for the Budweiser brand in the U.S., said in an earlier interview with AdWeek that while the story of Busch’s journey is “a universal story that is very relevant today,” it had “no correlation with anything else that’s happening in the country.”</p>
<p>Notably, the final cut of the ad also appears to depict less virulent xenophobia than an earlier version of the ad seen by AdWeek, in which one person says, “Go back to where you came from!” and Busch actually gets spat on. </p>
<p>Regardless of Anheuser-Busch’s desire to remain apolitical, a Super Bowl ad depicting an American immigrant overcoming xenophobia to achieve success in the U.S. has a political resonance.</p>
<p>In the days since the ad was revealed, the brewing company has faced a social media backlash from Trump supporters, who have threatened a boycott.</p>
<p>These sentiments may have sounded familiar to Adolphus Busch, who arrived in the U.S. when anti-German sentiment was on the rise. Many Germans left their homes to pursue a better economic lot in life ― as Busch did ― but some were political refugees, too, most famously a group known as the The Forty-Eighters, which left Germany after a failed fight to unify Germany. </p>
<p>All told, more than 5 million Germans traveled to the U.S. during the 19th century in hopes of a better life, leading to anger and resentment among many U.S. citizens, who harbored that resentment for many years to come.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>This article has been updated to include social media backlash to the ad.</p>

<p>One of the biggest names in NASCAR is speaking out in favor of immigration after President Donald Trump’s executive order halting the nation’s refugee program and banning travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations. </p>
<p>Dale Earnhardt Jr. responded to a tweet from Gelar Budidarma, who described himself as a Muslim NASCAR fan in Indonesia: </p>
<p>Budidarma then apologized, although it’s not clear for what as the previous tweet appears to have been deleted, and said “just feel uncomfortable in situation right now.”</p>
<p>Earnhardt replied: “I would too! I can’t imagine how that feels.”</p>
<p>He did not mention Trump or the specifics of the executive order, which has sparked protests around the world. </p>
<p>Earnhardt, who last month was named the sport’s most popular driver for the 14th consecutive year, has said in the past that he is a Republican but that it doesn’t mean he toes the party line. </p>
<p>While he supported President George W. Bush, he also took his crew to see Michael Moore’s “Fahrenheit 9/11” in 2004.</p>
<p>“I like hearing both sides of the argument,” he told CBS News at the time. </p>
<p>He also supported removing the Confederate flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state Capitol and in other settings, including at NASCAR races. </p>
<p>“I think it’s offensive to an entire race,” he said in 2015, according to USA Today. “It does nothing for anybody to be there flying, so I don’t see any reason. It belongs in the history books and that’s about it.”</p>

<p>Golden State Warriors’ coach Steve Kerr, whose father was killed by members of an Islamist extremist group, said that banning Muslims from entering the U.S. is “a horrible idea.”</p>
<p>Kerr said an interview on Sunday that he’s “completely against” President Donald Trump’s executive order blocking entry by people from seven majority-Muslim countries, signed Friday.</p>
<p>“It’s a horrible idea,” he said. “I feel for all the people who are affected. Families are being torn apart.”</p>
<p>Travelers coming from the Middle East, including some green card holders, were detained and questioned at airports across the U.S. in the days after Trump signed the controversial executive action. The order, part of which has already been blocked by multiple federal judges, also placed a temporary freeze on the Syrian refugee resettlement program.</p>
<p>Kerr’s father was the president of the American University in Beirut when he was assassinated in what then-President Ronald Reagan called an “act of terrorists.” As a U.S. citizen who spent years in Middle East, Malcolm Kerr dedicated his life to bridging the gap between the Arabic and Western worlds ― a gap that critics have said Trump’s executive action will widen.</p>
<p>“If we’re trying to combat terrorism by banishing people from coming to this country, we’re going against the principles of what our country’s about and creating fear,” Kerr said. “It’s the wrong way to go about it, if anything we could be breeding anger and terror.”</p>
<p>He added that, “I worry in the big picture what this means to the security of the world. It’s going about it completely opposite.”</p>

<p>Toronto Raptors guard Kyle Lowry had a simple answer when a reporter asked for his opinion on President Donald Trump’s executive order that bars refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States.</p>
<p>“I think it’s bullshit,” Lowry said Monday. “I think it’s absolute bullshit.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to get into it too deeply,” Lowry continued. “But personally, I think it’s bullshit.”</p>
<p>When another reporter asked him if he could give his opinion without swearing, Lowry declined.</p>
<p>“No, not at all,” Lowry said. “Y’all gotta bleep that out.”</p>
<p>The NBA scrambled this weekend to figure out how the executive order, which Trump signed Friday night, would affect two of its players: Milwaukee Bucks forward Thon Maker and Los Angeles Lakers guard Luol Deng. Both were born in what is now South Sudan ― Sudan is among the seven countries named in Trump’s order ― and are dual citizens (Maker is Australian, Deng is British). Maker was able to return to the United States from Toronto on Friday night after a game against Lowry’s Raptors, but the NBA still said it was seeking clarity from the State Department on how the order would work.</p>
<p>Deng tweeted on Monday that he was a “#ProudRefugee.” </p>
<p>“I would not be where I am today if it weren’t for the opportunity to find refuge in a safe harbor,” an accompanying statement said.</p>
<p>At least two NBA coaches also spoke out against the ban over the weekend. San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich called its hasty, confusing implementation “Keystone Kop-like,” while Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr ― whose father was killed in a terrorist act in Beirut in 1984 ― went even further.</p>
<p>“I would just say that as someone whose family member was a victim of terrorism, having lost my father, if we’re trying to combat terrorism by banishing people from coming to this country, by really going against the principles of what our country is about and creating fear, it’s the wrong way to go about it,” Kerr said. “If anything, we could be breeding anger and terror, so I’m completely against what’s happening. I think it’s shocking and a horrible idea and I really feel for all the people who are affected and the families that are being torn apart and I worry in the big picture what this means to the security of the world.”</p>

<p>In a Sunday letter to his employees, Nike president and CEO Mark Parker slammed President Donald Trump’s executive order that banned Syrian refugees and temporarily blocked travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States.</p>
<p>“Nike believes in a world where everyone celebrates the power of diversity. Regardless of whether or how you worship, where you come from or who you love, everyone’s individual experience is what makes us stronger as a whole,” Parker said in the note. “Those values are being threatened by the recent executive order in the U.S. banning refugees, as well as visitors, from seven Muslim-majority countries. This is a policy we don’t support.”</p>
<p>Parker’s statement specifically referenced British Olympic champion Mo Farah, who was born in Somalia, which is one of the countries on Trump’s travel ban list. In a Facebook post Farah raised concerns about the president’s executive order. The four-time gold medalist, who is sponsored by Nike, has lived and trained in Oregon for the past six years ― he was in Ethiopia when the order took effect. </p>
<p> “President Donald Trump,” Farah wrote, “seems to have made me an alien.” “It’s deeply troubling that I will have to tell my children that Daddy might not be able to come home ― to explain why the President has introduced a policy that comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice,” he continued in the post. On Saturday, a federal judge temporarily blocked part of the order that left lawful permanent residents ― commonly known as green card holders ― in limbo under the order. The Department of Homeland Security said on Sunday that the ban shouldn’t apply to green card holders, and they can “expect swift entry” once national security checks are completed. On Sunday night, a spokesperson for Farah told the BBC that he would be allowed to return to the United States, where his family remained while he trained in Ethiopia. “We understand from the statement released this evening by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that the executive order will not apply to Mo, and we are grateful to the FCO for urgently clarifying the situation,” the spokesperson said. “Mo is relieved that he will be able to return to his family once his current training camp concludes. However, as he said in his earlier statement, he still fundamentally disagrees with this incredibly divisive and discriminatory policy.” In his letter to employees, Parker said Nike will “do everything in our power to ensure the safety of every member of our family: our colleagues, our athletes and their loved ones.” “Nike,” Parker wrote, “stands together against bigotry and any form of discrimination.” </p>

<p>President Donald Trump’s executive order banning Syrian refugees and preventing travelers from several Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States has left people stranded in airports across the country and resulted in others being turned away at the door. Its impact has already been felt in the film industry, and there are growing concerns that the order could affect a number of professional athletes too. </p>
<p>Thon Maker, a rookie on the NBA’s Milwaukee Bucks who was born in South Sudan, was able to re-enter the United States without issue Friday night after the Bucks played the Toronto Raptors in Canada, the team said. Maker is a former refugee whose family fled Sudan when he was five.</p>
<p>Maker and Los Angeles Lakers guard Luol Deng, who is also Sudanese, are the two NBA players who could be most directly affected by Trump’s executive order. Though both have dual citizenship status ― Deng is British, Maker is Australian ― the order could still apply. Neither the Bucks nor Lakers are scheduled to travel to Toronto, the NBA’s only market outside the U.S., for the rest of the season, though Milwaukee could still end up facing the Raptors if both make the NBA playoffs this spring. </p>
<p>An NBA spokesperson said in a statement Saturday that the league is consulting with the State Department to see how the order might affect its players.</p>
<p>“We have reached out to the State Department and are in the process of gathering information to understand how this executive order would apply to players in our league who are from one of the impacted countries,” NBA spokesperson Mike Bass said in the statement. “The NBA is a global league, and we are proud to attract the very best players from around the world.”</p>
<p>A federal court on Saturday temporarily blocked part of Trump’s executive order, forbidding the deportation of refugees given government clearance or immigrants with valid visas. And while professional athletes may have better access to resources for immigration help, that many face uncertainty under Trump’s order is a reminder of how far-ranging its effects may be, especially in leagues where teams travel internationally. </p>
<p>No Major League Soccer players were born in the seven countries listed in Trump’s order, but two have ties. Steven Beitashour of Toronto FC is an Iranian-American dual citizen who has played for Iran’s national team. Columbus Crew’s Justin Meram, similarly, was born in the U.S. but has played for the Iraqi national team. It’s unclear how the order might affect either player. An MLS spokesperson declined to comment on the issue Sunday.</p>
<p>Michael Bradley, the captain of the U.S. Men’s National Team and Beitashour’s teammate in Toronto, said in an Instagram post Sunday that he is “sad and embarrassed” by Trump’s refugee ban.</p>
<p>One athlete has already felt the effects of Trump’s order. </p>
<p>“President Donald Trump,” British Olympic champion Mo Farah said in a Facebook post Sunday, “seems to have made me an alien.”</p>
<p>Farah, a four-time Olympic gold medalist, is a British citizen who was originally born in Somalia, one of the seven countries listed in the ban. He lives and trains in the United States, but was training abroad in Ethiopia when the order took effect Friday night. His wife and children live in Portland, Oregon.</p>
<p>“I am a British citizen who has lived in America for the past six years ― working hard, contributing to society, paying my taxes and bringing up our four children in the place they now call home,” Farah said on Facebook. “Now, me and many others like me are being told that we may not be welcome. It’s deeply troubling that I will have to tell my children that Daddy might not be able to come home ― to explain why the President has introduced a policy that comes from a place of ignorance and prejudice.”</p>
<p>Former NBA player Nazr Mohammed, who was born in Chicago to Ghanaian parents, criticized the ban Saturday afternoon. (Ghana is not among the seven countries named in the order, but Mohammed is a practicing Muslim.)</p>
<p>The ban has also drawn criticism from international sporting officials. Richard Peterkin, a member of the International Olympic Committee’s executive board, tweeted Saturday that “Trump’s Executive Order on immigration is totally contrary to Olympic ideals.” </p>
<p>The 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics included, for the first time, a team composed of refugees from around the world who competed under the Olympic banner. The 10-member team included two athletes from Syria and five from South Sudan.</p>

<p>By Nick Mulvenney</p>
<p>MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Roger Federer came out on top after a rollercoaster ride in the 35th chapter of his rivalry with Rafa Nadal to win his fifth Australian Open 6-4 3-6 6-1 3-6 6-3 and clinch a first grand slam title in four and a half years on Sunday.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old capped his triumphant return from knee surgery with a record-extending 18th major title after a vintage battle with his Spanish rival, who had won all three of their previous meetings at Melbourne Park.</p>
<p>Lefthander Nadal, also returning from injury this year, showed sustained periods of his brutal best from the baseline but was just unable to stay with his rival in the gut-wrenching drama of the deciding set.</p>
<p>Federer was forced to endure a nervous wait for his victory after Nadal unsuccessfully challenged the line call on the second championship point before becoming the first man to win five or more titles at three different grand slams.</p>
<p>The Swiss, for many the greatest player of all time, celebrated with tears in his eyes but his first words were for his old friend and rival.</p>
<p>“Tennis is a tough sport, there are no draws in tennis but I would have been happy to accept one tonight and share it with Rafa,” he said.</p>
<p>“I would have been happy to lose to be honest, the comeback was as good as it was. I hope to see you next year but if not, then it was a wonderful year here and I couldn’t be happier tonight.”</p>
<p>Nadal, the 2009 champion, was also typically gracious after losing his third Melbourne final and coming up short in his bid for a 15th grand slam title.</p>
<p>“It was a great match and I think Roger probably deserved it a little more than me,” the 30-year-old said.</p>
<p>“I played a great quality of tennis. That’s great news for me. I believe that if I have my body in the right condition, I can have a great year.”</p>
<p>FIRST BREAKTHROUGH</p>
<p>Federer made the slower start to the contest but it was the Swiss who made the first breakthrough, converting the first break point of the match with a forehand winner to go 5-4 up.</p>
<p>That was enough to take the opening set but this was never going to be a straightforward win for either player and Nadal was all over his opponent’s serve at the start of the second and grabbed a 2-0 lead.</p>
<p>Federer had two break points in the next game but Nadal fought them off and then broke again as his rival struggled for accuracy under the Spaniard’s onslaught.</p>
<p>Four big forehands gave the Swiss a break back but Nadal held firm to serve out the set and Federer needed three aces to save three break points at the start of the third.</p>
<p>The momentum had swung, though, and Federer stepped up a gear and rattled off the next two games with Nadal left scrambling to fend off a second break in a marathon fourth game.</p>
<p>He was unable to repeat the feat in the sixth game and Federer, his crosscourt backhand causing Nadal all sorts of problems, secured a two sets to one lead with a drop volley.</p>
<p>The pendulum had not finished swinging yet, however, and Nadal broke for 3-1 in the fourth and held under huge pressure in the next game with a brilliant crosscourt forehand winner at full stretch.</p>
<p>Nadal again closed out the set and Federer took a medical timeout before the start of the decider, returning to court only to give up his first service game.</p>
<p>Federer was not prepared to give up easily on a first grand slam title since Wimbledon in 2012, though, and upped his aggression to put the set back on serve at 3-3 when Nadal sent a rasping forehand wide.</p>
<p>He needed another five break points on Nadal’s next service game before the Spaniard finally cracked as Federer sealed the title with a forehand winner that Hawk-Eye confirmed hit the line.</p>
<p>“In the fifth set, I didn’t win one serve easily. Even if I played great in the break points, I was suffering a lot,” said Nadal.</p>
<p>“He probably remained a little bit more free on points on my serve. That’s what I needed in that moment, and I didn’t have.”</p>
<p>With Federer’s contemporary Serena Williams having won the women’s title for the seventh time on Saturday, the 2017 Australian Open is destined be remembered as the retro slam.</p>
<p>Federer gave a reminder that no one is immune to the ravages of time, however.</p>
<p>“Now it’s time to celebrate in a massive way,” he said. “(But) at 35 years old, I don’t like to say it, but I’m so old and so the body hurts, it aches.”</p>

<p>In just the past four years, six cities — Boston; Rome; Stockholm; Hamburg, Germany; Krakow, Poland; and Oslo, Norway — have decisively rejected the idea of hosting the Olympics.</p>
<p>The games’ exorbitant costs, devastating effects on poor communities and empty legacies in the places that have recently hosted them have turned cities, especially in democratic countries, against them — fostering the belief, as headline after headline has declared, that “nobody wants to host the Olympic Games anymore.”</p>
<p>But Los Angeles is different. And on Wednesday, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously granted final approval to the city’s bid for the 2024 Olympics, taking the step Boston and many others never did. In LA, organizers promise they can deliver an Olympics that stays within its proposed $5.3 billion budget — their latest bid proposal, in fact, projects that the games will break even financially. Organizers in every prospective host city make the same promise. But when it comes to LA, where residents overwhelmingly support the bid, even vocal skeptics of the Olympics believe that breaking even might be possible.</p>
<p>“It’s basically sound,” said Smith College economist Andrew Zimbalist, who wrote the book on the financial risks the Olympics pose to cities and their taxpayers. “I think they’ll be able to do it without any financial downside, although there is always some risk attached.”</p>
<p>“The last version of the budget that I saw looked like it was doable,” said Victor Matheson, a sports economist at the College of the Holy Cross who has studied the impact of the Olympics on host cities. “It didn’t have nearly as many magic asterisks. That was one of the problems with Boston. There were far too many ‘Don’t worry about it, this will come together just fine’ moments in that budget.”</p>
<p>There’s another reason to believe LA could succeed: It’s done it before. It last hosted the Olympics in 1984, when the International Olympic Committee was facing a similar crisis around its biggest event, and pulled off an Olympics that not only broke even but turned a small profit.</p>
<p>No host since has replicated that feat. But Los Angeles is once again following the same principles that made the ‘84 Games such a success. Organizers, as they did then, plan to rely almost entirely on private financing to cover the games’ operating budget. They also plan to avoid the costly construction projects that tend to send Olympic costs through the roof, thanks to the region’s array of existing sporting venues.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Coliseum, which was used for the 1932 and 1984 Olympics, will again serve as the centerpiece of the games, along with a new NFL stadium set to open in Inglewood in 2019. There’s no need for a new Olympic village, thanks to dorms at UCLA. When LA 2024 announced its final three proposed venues this month, chairman Casey Wasserman boasted that a Los Angeles Olympics won’t require any new construction — instead, it will rely entirely on existing, already planned or temporary venues. </p>
<p>There are potential pitfalls. Los Angeles was the only city to bid on the 1984 Games, which allowed it to dictate terms to the IOC and adhere to its modest budget. It faces a competitive bidding process with Paris and Budapest this time, and that, Matheson warned, could lead to escalating costs if the cities attempt to sexy up their bids to impress IOC voters. Securing an LA Olympics, meanwhile, could cost as much as $2 billion, Zimbalist estimates — more than the entire cost of the 1984 Games. And if LA 2024 goes over budget and exceeds its planned contingency fund, Los Angeles taxpayers could still end up on the hook: The LA city council and California legislature have approved the taxpayer backing the IOC demands.</p>
<p>But the positive experience of 1984 has seemingly given Angelenos assurance that their city is capable of doing this the right way, and likely explains why there has been so little of the public resistance that has become a typical part of Olympic bidding.</p>
<p>“Angelenos have really warm memories of 1984,” said Chris Dempsey, who attended college in Los Angeles and quit his job as a Massachusetts political consultant in 2015 to co-found No Boston Olympics, a nonprofit that helped derail that city’s bid. “It was an awesome moment and something the city was really proud of.”</p>
<p>That (along with relatively popular bids in Paris and Budapest) is no doubt good news for the IOC, which could use it after the the debacle of 2022 Winter Olympic Games bidding process ― when three European cities withdrew bids after they lost public referendums ― or the tumultuous early stages of 2024 bidding, when Boston, Hamburg and Rome all canceled Olympic efforts.</p>
<p>After a string of Olympics plagued by spiraling costs and myriad other problems, the IOC last year approved its Agenda 2020 reform package, meant to steer the bidding process toward more cost-conscious proposals. Los Angeles organizers have insisted that their bid is in line with those ideals, and that they won’t engage in a costly battle just to win the games. And while Paris, which last hosted in 1924, has also outlined a fairly modest bid, LA 2024 argues that it offers the IOC the best chance to show it is serious about choosing smarter bids over shinier ones ― and not just for 2024.</p>
<p>“We know that LA 2024 must not only deliver great games, they must also deliver transformative games,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said in November. “We believe our campaign isn’t just about the games in our city in 2024. We believe this bid is about ensuring that the games are sustainable and relevant in every year beyond 2024 as well.”</p>
<p>That, however, might be the one promise even Los Angeles can’t keep.</p>
<p>After the 1984 Games, the Olympics quickly returned to the same model and problems that had threatened their existence before. Costs escalated, the worst effects on communities returned. Few cities, it turns out, offer such a ready-made palate for hosting the sort of “bargain” games Los Angeles can pull off.</p>
<p>So although Olympic critics have found little to complain about when it comes to Los Angeles’ bid, they remain skeptical that it would lead to drastic changes in the Olympic model. Los Angeles could win hosting rights this September, host a successful Olympics in 2024, and still remain the exception to the budget-busting, human rights-threatening rule.</p>
<p>A top IOC official all but admitted as much this month, saying that despite Agenda 2020’s existence, he doesn’t anticipate sweeping changes to the bidding process in the near future.</p>
<p>“If you’re holding your breath for the IOC to make real substantive reforms,”Dempsey said, “you’re going to be in bad shape.”</p>
<p>CORRECTION: This post originally misstated that the LA Coliseum was built for the 1932 Olympics. It was built prior to that and later used for the Olympics.</p>

<p>Bilqis Abdul-Qaadir was a top basketball player in high school and a star Division 1 NCAA player at the University of Memphis. And she did it all while wearing a hijab.</p>
<p>Since graduating three years ago, Adbul-Qaadir has been fighting for professional players to be allowed to wear hijabs so she could pursue her dreams of a pro career. FIBA, basketball’s international governing body, doesn’t allow players to wear religious headgear. That could change this week.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, advocacy groups Athlete Ally and Shirzanan published an open letter encouraging FIBA to lift the ban.</p>
<p>“So long as the ban on religious headgear remains, millions of Muslim girls and women from the around the world will be denied the access, opportunity, and experience of basketball,” the letter states. “This is discrimination but it can easily be remedied.” </p>
<p>FIBA currently prohibits players from wearing “equipment (objects) that may cause injury to other players,” which includes hijabs and other religious headgear. But as The Guardian points out, there isn’t a single recorded incident of a player being injured by a hijab, turban or yarmulke during a game.</p>
<p>“One of the things that has become really important to Athlete Ally is to make sure that it’s intersectional,” Executive Director Hudson Taylor told Think Progress. “We can’t fight against one injustice without fighting against all injustices.”</p>
<p>Last year, mounting pressure from Muslim basketball players, as well as two U.S. congressmen, pushed FIBA to issue a response saying it would soon decide whether to keep the ban. But in September, the organization postponed the decision. It’s set to finally decide in a meeting this weekend, according to The Guardian.</p>
<p>More than 40 athletes and executives signed their names to Athlete Ally’s letter, including Adbul-Qaadir, former NFL players Husain and Hamza Abdullah, and tennis icon Billie Jean King.</p>
<p>“It means very much,” Adbul-Qaadir told Think Progress on the number of athletes pledging their support. “We’ve needed this support since day one, but better late than never.” </p>

<p>The Atlanta Falcons are heading to the Super Bowl on Feb. 5, but the team’s owner, Arthur Blank, has more to talk about than just that.</p>
<p>The billionaire co-founder of Home Depot recently spoke out on his desire for the government to address wealth inequality while appearing on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.”</p>
<p>“I think the gap between the haves and the have-nots over both Republican and Democratic administrations for probably the last 20 years or so has gotten too wide,” said Blank.</p>
<p>“One of the great strengths of this country is the diversity and is the inclusion. The way the country really has been great in the past and will be great in the future is by tapping into all the cultures, all the strengths, all the folks that have joined us from around the world for a very long period of time.”</p>
<p>The Trump administration’s prospects for addressing income inequality aren’t looking too great and it’s unclear if they’ll fight for low-income Americans. </p>
<p>Outside of his appearances talking about the Falcons making it to the Super Bowl, Blank has recently been in the news for his plans to pay for his entire staff to come to the big game.</p>
<p>Those fans are sure to enjoy the game, regardless of who wins. </p>

<p>Dan Quinn, the second-year Falcons head coach, swallowed his ego and decided that he could no longer strictly employ a Cover 3 defense, the same defense with which he helped the Seattle Seahawks capture Super Bowl XLVIII. While some coaches reject change and believe personnel should adapt to their philosophy, Quinn ― leading from the sidelines with a level of positivity not often seen in this league ― did the opposite. The 46-year-old opted for man coverage, not as the be-all and end-all for his defense, but as a way to complement his Cover 3 zone concepts. </p>
<p>Ironically, the change was triggered by Atlanta’s 33-32 Week 8 win over Green Bay. Aaron Rodgers feasted on the zone for most of the game, amassing nearly 250 yards and four touchdown passes. The Falcons failed to get off the field time and time again, particularly on third down, a surefire way to lose games in this league. Interestingly enough, it wasn’t that Quinn’s defense wasn’t capable ― it just wasn’t running the right system. </p>
<p> Without question, the Falcons’ defensive strengths are speed and tackling (two of the reasons why I highlighted them as unheralded championship contenders in October). Man coverage is one way to effectively maximize such strengths. Second-year cornerback Jalen Collins and hard-hitting undrafted rookie free agent Brian Poole aren’t yet shutdown corners, but both have become physical and deft in coverage, deploying complex concepts and skipping the normal growth curve of young players. Remember, too, that the pair has been pressed into action following the November announcement that Desmond Trufant ― arguably the best cover man in pro football ― would be sidelined the remainder of the season with a torn pectoral. Better yet, Atlanta features one of the league’s premier lines of defense in playmaking safeties Ricardo Allen and bruising standout Keanu Neal ― a clone of Kam Chancellor, whom Quinn hopes to model after. Neal’s five forced fumbles lead all rookies, and his 106 tackles are second. Then there is the matter of outside linebacker Deion Jones, the rangy second-rounder out of LSU. Jones leads all rookies with 108 tackles and is tied for first with three interceptions, two of which have gone for touchdowns (also ranking first). </p>
<p> Moreover, because the Atlanta pass rush is so dangerous, the secondary has not been tasked with covering as long. Don’t forget that the Falcons rank third in the NFL in quarterback hurries and feature the game’s top sack man, First-Team All-Pro selection Vic Beasley Jr. (another second-year home-run pick by General Manager Thomas Dimitroff), off the edge. Naturally, the results for Quinn’s altered defense have been staggering, making it the unsung hero for the NFC champs.   Since their midseason bye week, Atlanta has rattled off seven victories in eight games, surrendering only 20.5 points per matchup, to go along with a healthy 17 sacks and 16 forced turnovers. The scorching hot Packers, for example, only managed 21 points on two turnovers and two sacks, failing to even get on the scoreboard until 9:19 left in the third quarter, the longest it took a previously untouchable Rodgers to score all year.   </p>
<p>   Quinn offered these thoughts on his rapidly improving defense, following his club’s 23-point thrashing of Green Bay in the NFC Championship: “The more that you play together, and you gain experience together, the faster you can play.” “We’re playing faster now than we did earlier in the season,” he continued. “Our speed hasn’t changed in terms of lowering our 40 times, but because of our communication, because of our style and attitude that we’re able to play with, we’re able to play faster.”   </p>

<p>NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle first introduced a loose recreational drug code in 1971. Drug testing in the NFL began in 1982 and suspensions for drug use followed in 1989. Today, while medical marijuana is legal in 28 states and DC and recreational marijuana is legal in 8 states and DC, the NFL continues its draconian drug policy on pot partly because of stigma and partly because of the league’s robust alcohol sponsorships. But, while the suspensions and fines continue, the NFL Players Association (NFLPA), its players’ union, is considering language that would amend the collective bargaining agreement to allow a “less punitive” approach to recreational marijuana use. I urge the league to not only take a less punitive approach to recreational marijuana use, but also to exercise compassion and take a nonpunitive approach to medical marijuana use.</p>
<p>Many players in the NFL use marijuana for medical issues. The NFL suspended Seantrel Henderson ten games after he violated the league’s substance abuse policy by smoking pot to treat Crohn’s disease. Henderson found out he had Crohn’s last year. He has since been suspended twice - once for four games and again for ten games. Henderson had parts of his intestines removed surgically. He is clearly suffering. And, marijuana is widely known as the only effective treatment for Crohn’s disease that does not have terrible medical side effects. Clearly, the league should allow an exemption for players that use marijuana medicinally.</p>
<p>There are many more reasons that players use marijuana or could use marijuana medicinally. For example, former NFL player Eugene Monroe retired from the NFL because of accumulating pain from injuries and the lack of an exemption from the NFL to treat himself with marijuana. Monroe recently donated $80,000 towards research on marijuana to show the NFL, among other things, that CBD oil from the cannabis plant can treat and protect players from traumatic brain injuries. There is a ton of research showing that both THC and CBD play a positive role in rehabilitating and protecting the brain. If the NFL is serious about player safety and keeping its former players alive then they should immediately consider the evidence that marijuana is an effective medicine.</p>
<p>Some players in the NFL use marijuana to manage pain. The league currently allows doctors to prescribe opioid painkillers to the players for pain management. As we all know, opioids are highly addictive and have many awful side effects. Players have expressed an interest in treating pain with marijuana instead of opioids in order to avoid the side effects and addiction. Former NFL player Kyle Turley is one of them. Turley, since retiring, has become a vocal advocate for loosening the NFL’s drug policy. Turley took opioids since he blew out his knee in college and has been treating a brain injury with medications such as Depakote and Wellbutrin. He has expressed that the drugs gave him both suicidal and homicidal thoughts to the point where he was considering jumping out of a window at his college Hall of Fame induction ceremony. Surely, the NFL wants to avoid more suicides among players. There should have been a rush to find help for players suffering from traumatic brain injuries after Junior Seau committed suicide. But, the NFL is stubborn and dedicated to profit.</p>
<p>A simple answer for the league would be to bring in a group of medical marijuana experts and put together a list of medical issues for which its players can use marijuana. Then, they should accept petitions from players seeking a medical exemption from the drug policy and have the same panel consider each of them, offering a medical exemption to the drug policy for any petition deemed valid. If the league is truly serious about player safety and wants to protect the game going forward it will take my suggestions seriously. No player should get suspended or fined by the NFL for marijuana use if they have a valid reason for using it.</p>
<p>I understand that the league is under tremendous pressure to keep its head in the sand on marijuana use among players. The social stigma still exists, the plant is still illegal in many states and at the federal level and the league makes a lot of money from its alcohol sponsors. However, we are in a new era and player safety is a serious matter. More and more parents are saying that their kids are not allowed to play football. More people are taking notice of the tremendous amount of abuse the game puts on players’ bodies and brains. Even the NFL itself launched a huge, well-funded initiative around player safety, brain issues, etc. But, that is not enough. If the NFL is serious about its players, then they must include medical marijuana use as one of its solutions to injury issues. I am not suggesting that the league be a revolutionary. Much of that work is already done. The league just needs to get current with the dominating opinion on medical marijuana.</p>

<p>When it comes to having true, natural grit, there are very few individuals that can compare to the newly-retired basketball legend, Kobe Bryant. Whether spectators loved him or hated him, there is one thing that no one can deny about the superstar—he has one of the most impressive work ethics in all of professional sports. For years stories have emerged about just how hard and how much Bryant works to keep himself in top physical shape and to continue to improve his game. In short, if you want to learn something about grit, no matter where you are looking to apply it, there is no better person to look to than Kobe Bryant.</p>
<p>Keep Your Commitments </p>
<p>It can be really easy to make promises and commitments. It can be really difficult to keep those commitments, especially when times get tough. IF there is one lesson that any spectator can really take away from Bryant’s long career with the Los Angeles Lakers, it is that he knows what commitment means. Even when he was the best player in the league, even when the Lakers struggled and even when he could have gone somewhere else, Bryant kept his commitment to his organization and stayed with his team through it all.</p>
<p>You Need to Work When No One Else Is</p>
<p>There is a now famous story about Kobe Bryant’s workout regimen that was highlighted when he was training for the Olympics. A short version of the story highlights how Bryant got up at 4:15 AM to do conditioning, weight training and to shoot and make 800 shots, all before practice began. Bryant got up, practiced on his own for 7 hours before anyone else on an Olympic team showed up to start. Bryant wasn’t out-practicing with everyday people, he was out-practicing with the best basketball players in the world. However, for the then 34-year-old, this was normal. </p>
<p>His approach has always been a simple one, to work even when no one else is, and to practice over and over again until you reach your goals.</p>
<p>Tenacity Will Always Help You in the End </p>
<p>Bryant faced his fair share of setbacks, especially in his personal life. With a criminal case, struggling marriage, loss of endorsements and a highly-publicized fall from grace all looming over him, many thought that Bryant’s game would struggle as well. It did not. With hard work, he managed to rise above the drama in his personal life and find success in his professional one.</p>
<p>Visualize Your Goals </p>
<p>It is so important to have a vision for your life and for your future, and to have something tangible that you are trying to work towards. This is one of the best ways to turn those goals into reality is to have a clear vision that you use to motivate you towards success. This takes a unique type of tenacity in order to really verbalize and visualize these goals and put them out in the world without worrying about what others think or say. </p>
<p>Kobe Bryant always loved the Lakers and often talked about how growing up his biggest motivator was imagining himself as a Lakers player. He was drafted by the Hornets and traded to the Lakers right away, where he got to spend his entire career. He is a great example of visualizing your dreams and sticking to them.</p>
<p>Look at Challenges as Opportunities </p>
<p>One of the key things that any person can take away from Kobe Bryant’s success it is his ability to take challenges and turn them into opportunities for success. Late in his career, after suffering from an Achilles tendon injury, Kobe managed to face this challenge head on. He dug deep, had confidence and came back from his injury at a time in his career when most people just assumed he would retire. </p>
<p>Challenges shouldn’t cause you to give up, they should push you to grow stronger as a person.</p>
<p>Even if you weren’t a fan of Bryant’s during his long and exciting career with the LA Lakers, there is no denying the raw talent and incomparable work ethic that this athlete has. Keep these lessons on grit in mind whenever you need a little pick-me-up and just remember the fortitude that this iconic player has had over the years.</p>

<p>Having a rough day? Need a confidence-booster? </p>
<p>Listen to these pearls of wisdom from Mirjana Lucic-Baroni, a 34-year-old tennis star enjoying an improbable comeback. </p>
<p>After her once-promising career derailed and a long struggle to get back into the sport’s elite, she defeated 21-year-old Jennifer Brady at the Australian Open on Monday to reach the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam event for the first time in 18 years.</p>
<p>How’d she do it? </p>
<p>In an on-court interview after the match, Lucic-Baroni called herself a “tough little cookie” and spoke about how hard she’s worked. Then, she offered some advice to everyone else who’s going through some tough times. </p>
<p>“I will tell it to anyone struggling out there ― actually, I can’t say it because the TV’s here and I’m going to get fined, but...” she said. </p>
<p>“Oh go for it,” her interviewer pushed. “Go for it!” </p>
<p>That was all she needed:</p>
<p> “F everything and everybody, whoever tells you you can’t do it. Just show up and do it with your heart.”  </p>
<p>Words to live by.</p>

<p>New England Patriots star Tom Brady and President Donald Trump are buds. That’s understood.</p>
<p>But the Super Bowl–bound quarterback wants to know why their friendship grabs so much attention.</p>
<p>In an interview Monday with hosts of the “Kirk & Callahan Show” on Boston’s WEEI radio, Brady asked, “Why does that make such a big deal? I don’t understand that.”</p>
<p>The star player had been discussing his relationship with the president when he interjected with wonderment at the interest it’s sparked. The hosts asked if Brady had called to congratulate Trump on his election victory, as Trump said the player did at a pre-inaugural dinner attended by Patriots owner Robert Kraft.</p>
<p>“I have called him, yes, in the past,” Brady replied. “Sometimes he calls me. Sometimes I call him. But, it’s just, again, that’s been someone that I’ve known. I always try to keep it in context because ― for 16 years ― you know someone before, maybe, he was in the position that he was in. He’s been very supportive of me for a long time. It’s just a friendship. I got a lot of friends so I call a lot of people.”</p>
<p>Later asked about the negative view of Trump held by many women, Brady answered, “I don’t want to get into it. But if you know someone, it doesn’t mean you agree with everything they say or do, right? You have a lot of friends in your life. ... I think that there’s things that are based in your own dealings with someone that is a personal dealing, not a public dealing.”</p>

<p>Jan 22 (Reuters) - Matt Ryan piloted the high-flying Atlanta Falcons to a 44-21 rout of the Green Bay Packers in the National Football Conference Championship game on Sunday to advance to the Super Bowl for just the second time.</p>
<p>Ryan underlined his credentials as the favorite for NFL most valuable player honors, throwing for four touchdowns and running for another to reach the Feb. 5 Super Bowl in Houston where Atlanta will take on either the New England Patriots or Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
<p>The Falcons celebrated the last game to be played at the Georgia Dome with an awesome display of offensive fireworks piling up 493 total yards to get back to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1999 and a chance to claim the franchise’s first NFL championship.</p>
<p>What was expected to be a shootout between two of the league’s supercharged attacks was instead a lopsided affair as the Falcons stormed to an early lead and never looked back as Ryan completed 27-of-38 passes for 392 yards.</p>
<p>Ryan’s favorite target Julio Jones hauled in nine catches for 180 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers never got the Packers offense in gear. The Packers were shutout in the opening half and trailed 31-0 before finally getting on the scoreboard.</p>

<p>Kansas City Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura and former MLB infielder Andy Marte were killed in separate car crashes in the Dominican Republic on Sunday morning, according to reports.</p>
<p>There were few immediate details into either man’s death. Marte, 33, died after a car he was driving hit a house, about 95 miles north of Santo Domingo, ESPN reported, citing metropolitan traffic authorities.</p>
<p>A highway patrol spokesman, reached by The Associated Press, said Ventura, 25, was killed on a highway leading to the town of Juan Adrian, about 40 miles northwest of Santo Domingo. It’s not clear if he was the one driving.</p>
<p>“Our prayers right now are with Yordano’s family as we mourn this young man’s passing,” Royals General Manager Dayton Moore said in a statement. “He was so young and so talented, full of youthful exuberance and always brought a smile to everyone he interacted with. We will get through this as an organization, but right now is a time to mourn and celebrate the life of Yordano.”</p>
<p>Ventura spent his entire professional career with the Royals after signing with them as a non-drafted free agent in 2008. He debuted for the club in 2013 and went on to pitch in two World Series games in 2014 and 2015.</p>
<p>Marte last played in the majors with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2014. His last two seasons were played with the KT Wiz of the Korean Baseball Organization.</p>
<p>J.M.G. Baseball, which represented Marte, joined the Royals, Diamondbacks and several other MLB teams in expressing its heartbreak on social media.</p>

<p>MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Uzbek journeyman Denis Istomin pulled off an Australian Open upset for the ages on Thursday when he sent Novak Djokovic tumbling out of the second round of the grand slam the Serbian has all but dominated for the last seven years.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old world number 117 played the match of his life to hand the six-times champion only his second defeat in 41 matches at Melbourne Park since 2011 with a 7-6(8) 5-7 2-6 7-6(5) 6-4 second-round win on Rod Laver Arena.</p>
<p>Istomin, playing in his trademark fluorescent yellow glasses and bandana, let out a huge roar when the 12-times grand slam champion Djokovic sent a service return long to end an enthralling contest after four hours and 50 minutes.</p>
<p>“All the credit to Denis for playing amazing, he deserved to win,” said reigning champion Djokovic after making his earliest exit at a grand slam since 2008.</p>
<p>“I was not pleased with my performance. It was just one of days when you don’t feel that great and the other player is really feeling the ball. That’s sport.”</p>
<p>Istomin, who needed to go to the Asia-Pacific qualifying tournament just to get a wildcard for his 11th Australian Open, was stunned by his own performance.</p>
<p>“First of all I feel sorry for Novak. I was playing so good today,” Istomin said in an on-court interview.</p>
<p>“So much emotion on my mind so I cannot hold it you know but I want to say thanks very much for coming to support me.”</p>
<p>To say the odds were stacked against the 117th-ranked Uzbek was an understatement.</p>
<p>Second seed Djokovic had won all five of their previous meetings, giving up just one set, and had lost to a player ranked outside the top 100 only once since 2010.</p>
<p>Istomin knew he would have to play the best tennis of his life to have even a chance of victory and he produced it in a captivating arm-wrestle of a contest.</p>
<p>Charging out of the gate, Istomin hit seven aces and 27 winners in the opener, taking the match to the world number two and prevailing when Djokovic hit a return long on his third set point in a 13-minute tiebreaker.</p>
<p>The onslaught continued in the second set, Istomin moving the Djokovic around the court and smashing winner after winner off his forehand.</p>
<p>Djokovic shouted in frustration, watched his first service success rate slide into the 60th percentile and called for the trainer after feeling a twinge in the back of his leg.</p>
<p>The tide looked to have turned, however, when the Serbian scrambled to save two set points in the second stanza before breaking the Uzbek immediately and serving out to even up the contest.</p>
<p>Djokovic whipped through the third set in a relatively rapid 45 minutes but Istomin, by now nursing his left thigh with an ice-pack at every changeover, would simply not fold.</p>
<p>“I mean it was tough, since third set I get cramping in my leg so I don’t know how I held on,” added Istomin, whose reward for the biggest win of his career is a third-round meeting with Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta.</p>
<p>Going for everything, the former world number 33 grabbed an early break in the fourth and, even after Djokovic broke back, raced to a 5-1 lead in the tiebreaker before sealing the set to send the match into a decider.</p>
<p>The crowd were expecting the famed Djokovic fight back in the final set but it was Istomin who ripped a backhand down the line to take an early break before playing some dazzling tennis to beat back every Djokovic assault and claim a famous win.</p>

<p>You aren’t what you’re not.</p>
<p>I really like and respect Carmelo Anthony as a human being and as a ballplayer. He’s loyal to a fault and anxious to do the right thing. Melo has clearly proven he can play an integral role on a championship team. His successes in Syracuse, in Beijing, in London and in Rio provide clear evidence of that. Carmelo illustrated this past summer that he can rally fellow superstars (CP3, D-Wade and LeBron) to take a much-needed public stand on compelling community and nationwide issues. But become the de facto leader of the NY Knicks? I think we already know the answer to that.</p>
<p>Carmelo Kyam Anthony will end this season (with as many as five or six more seasons still on the horizon) among the top 25 all-time NBA scorers, surpassing the likes of Jerry West, Larry Bird, Gary Payton and David Robinson. So why, then, can’t we simply give Melo his props for what he is… an incredible offensive talent who has earned nine NBA All-Star nods, a scoring championship and a place among the NBA’s all-time elite players?</p>
<p>Why do we fixate on the fact that Carmelo can’t “lead” the Knicks? Could it be because “the powers that be” can’t really lead their organization to even a modicum of success? No one will ever confuse Knicks owner Jim Dolan with New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft. And anyone in the know realizes that Phil Jackson has as many championships as President of Basketball Operations as you or I do. </p>
<p>Very few great players are great leaders. A recent survey of coaches by the respected Janssen Sports Leadership Center referenced the fact that the majority estimated that their best player was rarely their best leader. As a matter of fact, in their eyes, that double-bonus occurs ―at best ― only 10 percent of the time. Even more interesting, very few great coaches were great players. In any sport. Phil Jackson certainly wasn’t Willis Reed; he was a journeyman power forward with a credit card vertical leap. </p>
<p>Surprised? I’m not. I’ve played with incredibly talented players whose demeanor and personality didn’t necessarily get their team to buy into what it takes to win championships. But a Shane Battier, he could lead me off a cliff and I’d go smiling. </p>
<p>So what exactly did Melo do to become persona non grata in the city and state he holds so dear? Plain and simple, he was too loyal and too naïve. The guy turns down enticing offers from winning teams; he passes over the LA Lakers and all La La Land could have meant to his and his wife’s long-term future to help the Knicks win. Sound like a real villain to you? I don’t think so. If you know Melo, you know he is all about earning a second championship in NY ― this time, in the NBA and not the NCAA. As for naïve, he bought the Kool-Aid that Phil Jackson was selling about doing all it takes to turn the Knicks into champions again. For Phil, apparently that doesn’t include spending most of your time around the team OR attending NBA pre-draft camps.</p>
<p>There are a few important takeaways. Carmelo is a Hall of Fame player. Phil is a Hall of Fame Coach. And Jim Dolan is a guitar-playing wannabe who can afford the entire front row of seats at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Let’s face it. Thirty-two year-old Carmelo isn’t waking up tomorrow as a natural leader. Seventy-one year-old Phil isn’t committed to all that it takes in his new role. And sixty-one year-old Jim Dolan will still have a team growing more valuable every day despite his ineptness. </p>
<p>Carmelo deserves better than to be positioned by ownership, management and the media as the reason the Knicks are a failure. Trust me. He expects more out of himself and he should. But he really deserves much more from those who pay his salary. So do all Knick fans.</p>

<p>Dallas Cowboys fan Jordan Garnett showed a lot of confidence in his beloved football team when he decided to prematurely crown them “Super Bowl LI Champions” in a tattoo on his right arm back in December.</p>
<p>You can see where this is going.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Garnett, Mason Crosby’s last second field goal lifted the Green Bay Packers to victory on Sunday, suddenly rendering the inked title on his arm an impossibility. The Cowboys will not be champions in this year’s event.</p>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<p>Yeah, they let him down. Not a very good call.</p>
<p>Nothing a little more ink can’t fix though, right? Having left just enough space to amend his prediction, Garnett sent out a picture of his new tattoo on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The Siena Saints defeated the Rider Broncs, 78-68, in a fight-marred college basketball game Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Clearly, there were some bruised feelings afterward.</p>
<p>Rider’s players refused to shake hands according to the customary postgame gesture. But that didn’t stop Siena’s Coach Jimmy Patsos from completing the tradition anyway ― as if his opponents were there.</p>
<p>Here’s another clip:</p>
<p>Nice one, coach. The night needed a little levity after a late-game scuffle led to technicals and ejections. </p>
<p>Patsos later dismissed the incident, telling the Daily Gazette it was “just old-fashioned tough basketball.” Rider’s Coach Kevin Baggett defended his actions to ESPN, saying he “didn’t want anything to escalate again between the teams.”</p>

<p>The Chargers are free to leave San Diego, but shouldn’t expect the city’s movers for help.</p>
<p>More than two dozen companies are backing a petition against helping the NFL team uproot to Los Angeles following news of their relocation last week.</p>
<p>“We are all professional movers who don’t want to see our 56 years of San Diego Chargers history be pulled out from under us,” the online petition reads.</p>
<p>If anyone needs to go, they suggested it be the team’s owner Dean Spanos, who they offered their services to.</p>
<p>The unusual petition was launched Thursday by online moving company HireAHelper, which helps connect consumers with movers.</p>
<p>“They can’t move to LA without a mover. So what if all the movers in San Diego refused them? That was the idea behind it,” Ryan Charles, HireAHelper’s vice president of marketing, told The San Diego Union-Tribune.</p>
<p>Charles, speaking to NBC 7, said that in addition to creating the petition, they started to cold-call other moving companies, asking if they’d join their boycott.</p>
<p>“The feedback was immediately positive,” he said. “I got chuckles, people were laughing, there were guys saying, ‘I wouldn’t move them for X amount of dollars.’”</p>
<p>It’s not only San Diego companies that have dug their heels into the ground, however. At least eight Los Angeles-based companies have also signed on, according to the petition’s website.</p>
<p>In another Charge.org petition, nearly 5,000 people have signed against the team’s brand leaving San Diego. If they have to go, the represented fans ask that the team’s name be changed to something else.</p>
<p>“Dean Spanos should be free to move his team and his business to LA, but he should NOT be allowed to take our history and all the goes along with being a Charger and Fan with him,” the petition states. “The Chargers name should stay and belong to San Diego should we ever form another team and Dean Spanos should be forced to find a new team name in LA.”</p>
<p>A request for comment from the Chargers Tuesday on the petition was not immediately returned.</p>

<p>WWE Hall of Famer Jimmy “Superfly” Snuka, who made a name for himself both in and out of the ring, died on Sunday, his family announced. He was 73. </p>
<p>The Fiji-born wrestler had been living in hospice care in Florida while battling stomach cancer and dementia over the last year, his family had said.</p>
<p>He was brought home from the hospital Sunday morning to be with his family shortly before his death, the family’s attorney, Robert Kirwan, told The Huffington Post. </p>
<p>Kirwan said his death was due to “ongoing medical problems.”</p>
<p>Snuka’s daughter, fellow wrestler Tamina Snuka, announced the news of her father’s death on social media Sunday by sharing a photo of what appeared to be her holding his hand.</p>
<p>Actor Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson also shared the news to his Twitter followers.</p>
<p>The last year of Snuka’s life had been another kind of wrestling match after he was charged in late 2015 for the 1983 death of his former girlfriend, Nancy Argentino.</p>
<p>Earlier this month a Pennsylvania judge dropped third-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter charges against Snuka after ruling that he was incompetent to stand trial. At the time of the judge’s decision, the retired athlete was said to have just months to live.</p>
<p>“At the rate he’s going, at the rate he’s deteriorating, I don’t think that he’ll make it until May or June of this year,” Kirwan told HuffPost.</p>
<p>Addressing the past charges against Snuka on Sunday, Kirwan said that his office plans to release vindicating new information about the case “at the appropriate time.”</p>
<p>“There’s more to the case than we were able to say,” he said.</p>
<p>Snuka, who was known for his high-flying style of wrestling, was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 1996.</p>
<p>His name was scrubbed from the site after the criminal charges were brought against him. That same treatment was given to retired wrestler Hulk Hogan after a recording of him using racist language surfaced on the web.</p>
<p>The WWE added its voice to the number of statements mourning Snuka’s loss. In a statement, the company memorialized his wrestling techniques.</p>
<p>“Snuka is regarded by many as the pioneer of high-flying offense because of his Superfly Splash from the top turnbuckle. His dive off the top of the steel cage onto Don Muraco at Madison Square Garden as hundreds of flash bulbs went off will forever live as one of the most memorable moments in WWE history.</p>
<p>“WWE extends its condolences to Snuka’s family, friends and fans,” they stated.</p>
<p>CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated incorrectly that Snuka was charged with first-degree murder. It was third-degree murder. </p>

<p></p>
<p>For Swiss Olympic golfer Fabienne In-Albon, competing in the Olympic Games had been a life-long dream -- one she'd been training for since she was just 10 years old. Here's the way she describes her big moment:</p>
<p>"At the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio when I walked to the first tee on the first day of competition, I was very nervous, I felt sick, and I wasn't quite sure how I would be able to hit this first tee shot as my entire body was shaking from all the nerves. I was [finally] standing there, just about to tee off, and the emotions that went through my body in that moment were overwhelming. I had to find a way of calming myself down and making sure that I could hit a good first tee shot." Fortunately, Fabienne had prepared for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and knew just what to do.</p>
<p>A different kind of training For world-class athletes, even the most rigorous and advanced physical training is no guarantee of success in a high-stakes competition. Unless they can tap into their full mental potential, no athlete can triumph in the moment that counts the most. I know this first-hand from my work helping athletes and business leaders prepare for high-pressure situations. On a panel discussion I recently participated in at the 2nd World Summit on Ethics and Leadership in Sports -- sharing the stage with Fabienne -- I was keenly reminded of just how powerful mental mastery can be. Fabienne used breathing techniques to combat her nerves. "Suddenly I was completely in the NOW," she said, "and it was just myself, my ball and the fairway. No spectators, no cameras, no TV, nothing -- just me, myself and I. I was totally in my zone and that's how I hit one of the best shots in my life."</p>
<p>Mastering the mind: Practical tools To truly thrive in big moments requires self-mastery, whether you're an athlete or not. In the same way we cultivate our physical muscles, there are ways to stimulate greater mental hygiene and regulation. For athletes, mastering the mind through breathing, meditation and other techniques offers clear advantages. Dr. Emma Seppälä, Science Director of Stanford University's Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education, recently published a great infographic explaining the scientific benefits of breathing. According to Dr. Seppälä, breathing practices:</p>
<p>Decrease stress and regulate our body's level of cortisol, the stress hormone Reduce pain and the activation of pain centers in the brain Strengthen our ability to regulate emotions Other experts have noted improved sleep, faster recovery time and enhanced endurance -- and not just for athletes. </p>
<p>More than a trend</p>
<p>Fabienne's approach to competition isn't new, but it is gaining momentum as more high-profile athletes adopt it. NBA superstars like LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan have all used meditation and other mindfulness techniques to take their play to the next level. Olympic gold medalists Misty May-Trainor and Kerri Walsh have applied visualization and meditation to stay sharp on the volleyball court. And prior to his retirement, future baseball Hall-of-Famer Derek Jeter noted that one-hour morning meditations were a staple of his off-day routine. These athletes' success demonstrates the power of mental training, but there's also plenty of science to back it up.</p>
<p>Winning in the moments that matter most Consider the story of Lionel Messi, the Argentine pro-soccer player widely regarded as one of the world's best. Argentina had never won a major tournament with Messi on the team, a fact he was constantly reminded of in the run-up to the Copa America championship against Chile. When the time came for him to make the winning penalty kick, he shot the ball into the stands. Images of Messi, visibly crushed, defined a game that was Argentina's to lose. In what may have been the biggest moment of his career, Messi wasn't able to muster the emotional resiliency to triumph.</p>
<p>For athletes -- or any of us who face make-or-break moments (and who doesn't?) -- mastering our minds and our breath can be the difference between winning the big game and going home defeated.</p>

<p>When it comes to their players, NFL teams abide by an oft-repeated motto: “Next man up.”</p>
<p>It’s a simple concept. In a league where injuries are the norm and the average career is right around three years, the only way to make it through a season is to plug in the next available guy whenever the man ahead of him inevitably goes down. It is callous and dehumanizing, but its unquestioned ubiquity is a reminder that all but a handful of NFL players exist as easily replaceable chattel.</p>
<p>San Diego Chargers owner Dean Spanos confirmed reports on Thursday morning that he will relocate his franchise to Los Angeles, leaving the city his team has called home for 56 years after it refused to give him the billion-dollar stadium he wanted.</p>
<p>If every utterance of “Next Man Up” is a reminder that NFL franchises don’t really care about players on the field, the Chargers’ move should be the latest signal to fans that they are subject to the same dynamic.</p>
<p>You are as easily replaceable as the backup right tackle. Your favorite team doesn’t care about you, either.</p>
<p>On first glance, it doesn’t make sense for the Chargers to move to Los Angeles. The city was perfectly fine without an NFL franchise for more than two decades, after the Raiders and Rams dipped out of town for Oakland and St. Louis, respectively, in 1994. Now it will have two. </p>
<p>The Rams returned, somewhat ceremoniously, to LA before the 2016 season, and were greeted as a bad team should be: with hordes of empty seats and minuscule local television ratings. The Chargers, who played one season in LA in 1960 but but otherwise don’t have much connection to their new home, will likely find an even more acute lack of interest upon arrival.</p>
<p>Compare that to San Diego. This final fateful season not withstanding, the city loved the Chargers even though the team rarely loved it back. The Chargers made the playoffs just 17 times in their 56 seasons in San Diego. They played in one Super Bowl, which they lost (they were 1963 AFL Champions, at least). For most of their history, the Chargers were a bad team. Their fans stuck by them anyway, because they are fans: Their favorite team is a connection to share with the community around them, a family heirloom to pass down to their sons and daughters. </p>
<p>None of that mattered to Spanos, regardless of how conflicted he suggests he might have felt about leaving the city. And none of it matters to other NFL owners, either, regardless of how many of them reportedly wanted the Chargers to figure out a way to stay. Put them in Spanos’ shoes, and almost all of them would have made the same decision.</p>
<p>Because to owners, teams are first and foremost a financial asset. Their value is measured less by wins and losses and irreplaceable moments than by the bottom line and their place on an annual Forbes list.</p>
<p>There is no better way to increase the value of that asset than with a new stadium, and the luxury boxes and naming rights agreements and sweetheart financial deals that come with them. That’s what Spanos wanted, and what San Diego repeatedly declined to give him.</p>
<p>There will be some, even in the Chargers fan base, who blame this move on San Diego taxpayers because they repeatedly rejected proposals to grant Spanos hundreds of millions (and even more than a billion) dollars in public money.</p>
<p>That anger will be misplaced.</p>
<p>If Spanos and the NFL wanted to keep the Chargers in San Diego, they could have. The Spanos family is reportedly worth more than $2 billion, banks that grant loans to extremely wealthy people exist, and the league has its own loan program that would have covered as much as $300 million in construction costs. The $650 million relocation fee Spanos will pay the league is more than enough to cover the supposed funding gap in Mayor Kevin Faulconer’s last-minute effort to keep the team. It’s even enough to build a new venue to replace the aging Qualcomm Stadium ― albeit one less lavish than many of the new, taxpayer-financed stadiums going up around the league. </p>
<p>But that was never going to happen, because paying for his own stadium in San Diego wouldn’t have been as lucrative as paying the relocation fee and adding a Los Angeles-area zip code to the Chargers’ letterhead.</p>
<p>The Rams are a perfect example. The move to Los Angeles will reportedly double the franchise’s value, so it never mattered that St. Louis made a fine home, that the city tried to give the team’s owner the stadium he claimed to want, or that it is still footing the bill for the now mostly empty venue the team left behind. And it never mattered that Angelenos might not care enough about the Rams to show up at the stadium or watch on TV, either.</p>
<p>The only thing that does matter is increasing the franchise’s value for whenever it comes time to sell. And so now we have the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers.</p>
<p>These teams are not alone. The Raiders are trying as hard as they can to leave Oakland for Las Vegas, where Sheldon Adelson and Co. secured $750 million in public financing for a new stadium that will provide a big boost to a team owner with one of the lowest net worths in the NFL.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Vikings, Miami Dolphins and Buffalo Bills ― to name just a few ― have floated the idea of leaving their cities and fans in recent years. Even when they do stay, teams show little regard for the local people who fill their stadiums, vapid “Fan Appreciation Night” events aside. Consider the Cincinnati Bengals, who secured a stadium deal so lucrative for ownership and so bad for the city that Cincinnati had to sell off a public hospital to pay its debts.</p>
<p>And it’s not just NFL owners. This dynamic repeatedly plays out in the MLB, NBA and NHL. Even Major League Soccer franchises have tried to get in on the act.</p>
<p>There are ways to fix this. We could blow up the ownership structure of sports teams, which allows this scam to persist, by permitting the sort of public ownership that has kept a team like the Packers in tiny Green Bay.</p>
<p>The fan-ownership model doesn’t come without risks, but it has worked for decades in Green Bay and all across European soccer, and it at least allows us to love our teams without constant fear that they will threaten to move just 17 years after we open our pocketbooks ― and risk our schools, roads and everything else ― to keep them. Economists, fans and even Newt Gingrich ― hardly a raging socialist ― have supported the idea.</p>
<p>But the people who control professional sports will never allow it to happen (the Packers’ ownership structure is no longer permissible under NFL rules). The system as designed has made them even wealthier than they already were, and gives them the leverage they need to ensure that their franchises are the constantly-appreciating assets they want them to be.</p>
<p>You, the fan, may laugh and cheer and cry with your team, and even wait through a century or more of deflating losses for the one moment of euphoria that even the most hapless franchise will inevitably provide. But to your team’s owner, you are little more than an ATM that should hand over every available dollar inside.</p>
<p>And when you hit your limit, as San Diego finally did, they will cast aside all those years of devotion as easily as they cut the aging middle linebacker with a bum knee. </p>
<p>Next Fan Up, you might say.</p>

<p>Owners of the San Diego Chargers have informed NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell of their intention to relocate the franchise to Los Angeles for the 2017 season and beyond, ESPN and other news outlets reported late Wednesday.</p>
<p>The relocation plan is not yet finalized, according to ESPN, and the Chargers have not yet determined where in the Los Angeles area they will play next season. But Chargers owner Dean Spanos is widely expected to put the finishing touches on the move in the coming days and will reportedly inform Chargers staff of those plans Thursday morning.</p>
<p>The move will bring an end to the Chargers’ 55-year run in San Diego, which they have called home for every season of their existence except the first, when they played in Los Angeles. And after more than two decades without an NFL franchise, Los Angeles will now have two. The Rams returned there from St. Louis before the 2016 season. </p>
<p>The Chargers attempted to beat the Rams to L.A. but were thwarted last season when NFL owners chose the Rams’ stadium proposal over an alternate plan in which the Chargers and Oakland Raiders would have shared a new venue. That process, however, included an option for the Chargers to relocate to Los Angeles before the 2017 season and share the new stadium the Rams are building in Inglewood. The franchise has until Tuesday to exercise that option.</p>
<p>Spanos and the Chargers had been seeking a new stadium in San Diego and were asking for a significant public subsidy in order to get one. Voters in November overwhelmingly rejected a ballot measure that would have devoted more than $1 billion in taxpayer money toward the stadium and a surrounding project.</p>
<p>Spanos and San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer continued to seek an alternative deal after the measure failed at the polls. The latest plan would have required at least $375 million in public money. NFL owners had also been considering ways to help the Chargers remain in San Diego during their meetings in New York this week but were apparently unable to develop a plan convincing enough to make the team stay.</p>
<p>So unless something changes at the last minute, it appears the Chargers will head north to Los Angeles instead of trying yet again to persuade San Diego taxpayers to help pay for a new stadium. </p>
<p>The Chargers might not be the only team to relocate this offseason. The Oakland Raiders are still seeking approval from NFL owners for a move to Las Vegas, which has plans to build a stadium that will receive $750 million in taxpayer financing. NFL owners could vote on that possible move in March.</p>

<p>Heading into the NFL Playoffs last weekend, the New England Patriots were the clearcut Super Bowl favorite, according to Las Vegas oddsmakers. With the Pats listed at 7-5, Dallas came in at 7-2, followed by red-hot Green Bay at 8-1.</p>
<p>The Atlanta Falcons, meanwhile, were listed at 10-1, alongside perennial playoff disappointment Kansas City. Hardly any action has come in on the Falcons either.</p>
<p>To be sure, Las Vegas spreads are not the barometer for postseason success ― they’re merely designed to drum up equal betting action on both sides. But they do tell us which teams are being ignored by the betting public, and Atlanta is certainly one of them. </p>
<p>And that seems dumbfounding ― as I’ve written before ― when we examine the Falcons.</p>
<p>Atlanta, the NFC South champs and second-seeded in the conference, is set to host (and seek revenge) against NFC West winners Seattle in the Divisional Round on Saturday.</p>
<p>From an offensive standpoint, Atlanta may be the most lethally balanced unit in the league. First Team All-Pro quarterback Matt Ryan ranks second in the NFL with 38 touchdowns ― eclipsed only by Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers ― and he has the best passer rating in the game at a robust 117.1. And he’s achieved all this while heaving the ball down the field: Ryan leads this season in yards per attempt. The next closest quarterback, fellow MVP candidate Tom Brady, trails him by more than a full yard.</p>
<p>In fact, ESPN reports, “Ryan completed 30 of 60 passes thrown 20 or more yards in the air down the field for 1,116 yards with 10 touchdowns and no interceptions.” According to ESPN, only the Colts’ Andrew Luck and the Seahawks’ Russell Wilson have better completion rates this season.</p>
<p>Of course, the knock on Ryan in years past has been his slew of turnovers, particularly in critical situations. Last year for example, he trailed only New York’s Eli Manning with six red-zone interceptions, according to Pro Football Focus. </p>
<p>This season, however, Ryan has limited his mistakes, tossing just seven picks (one in the red zone) and ranking third behind Rodgers and New Orleans’ Drew Brees in red-zone efficiency.</p>
<p>Ryan’s prowess is undoubtedly due in part to the spectacular play of wide receiver Julio Jones. The 27-year-old Jones is second in the league in both receiving yards (1,409) and 20-plus yard catches (27). His average of 100.6 yards per game ranks first, and he has dropped just three balls over a staggering 125 times as the targeted receiver.</p>
<p>If we go back to 2012 ― when Atlanta was merely one short completion away from the Super Bowl ― we see that the offense was buoyed by a balanced attack. Roddy White remained a viable second option alongside Jones, and tight end Tony Gonzalez was a First-Team All-Pro. This year’s Falcons roster doesn’t possess a player like the future Hall of Famer Gonzalez, but the 11-5 team has fielded a quartet of receiving threats other than Jones. </p>
<p>Free agent acquisition Mohamed Sanu is a productive big body inside the 20s, while Tevin Coleman (421 receiving yards) and Devonta Freeman (54 receptions) are two of the premier pass-catching backs in pro football. Freeman, the back-to-back Pro Bowler, lacks no confidence and boasts a 4.8 rushing average, along with 13 total touchdowns.</p>
<p>Perhaps the real surprise has been the 5-foot-8-inch speed demon Taylor Gabriel, who went undrafted in 2014. More recently, the third-year man out of little-known FCS Abilene Christian had been cut by the lowly Cleveland Browns. </p>
<p>But after amassing just eight catches through Atlanta’s first eight games this year, Gabriel ― who’s not unlike the Chiefs’ Tyreek Hill in dynamic ability ― caught fire, totaling 27 catches over the last eight games. His main contribution could be his explosiveness: He has seven total touchdowns, including individual plays of 47, 26, 76, 35, 64, 31 and 27 yards. In fact, Gabriel’s 18 percent touchdown rate would be tops in the NFL if he had the qualified number of touches.</p>
<p>That being said, maybe the biggest reason why the public seems to underrate the Falcons is its defensive unit, which ranks just 25th in total defense and 27th in opposition scoring. And that’s a fair complaint.</p>
<p>But it’s not as if this defense lacks a slew of talented playmakers. (That was more of a glaring issue during the 2015 campaign.)</p>
<p>While Pro Bowl cornerback Desmond Trufant has been lost for the year with a shoulder injury, second-year edge rusher Vic Beasley Jr. earned First-Team All-Pro honors and leads the NFL with 15.5 sacks. He is a viable Defensive Player of the Year candidate.</p>
<p>Additionally, standout rookies Keanu Neal and Deion Jones both have over 100 tackles, including more than 70 solo. Neal, a highly touted first-rounder out of Florida, has received more publicity because of his five forced fumbles, while Jones has three picks, two of which he returned for touchdowns.</p>
<p>“They have a real knack for the football,” head coach Dan Quinn said during his team’s playoff bye week.</p>
<p>Better yet, Neal and Jones clearly pass Quinn’s “CT grade,” which he described to The Huffington Post last season. “[General manager Thomas Dimitroff] and I both think that toughness is a talent,” Quinn said. “You have to be freed up mentally so you can make full-speed decisions. We love when we see that in guys. ... We grade guys on a ‘CT’ [competitive and toughness] grade, and that means something to me.” </p>
<p>With a dominant offense and an opportunistic, if not spectacular, defense, Atlanta has as good a chance as anyone to run the table in the NFL’s single-elimination tournament. The NFC in particular appears wide open, with question marks surrounding Dak Prescott and top-seeded Dallas, along with the struggling Seahawks and streaking Packers. </p>
<p>But the bottom line could be Ryan. This is a quarterback-driven league, and the Falcons may have the league MVP in him.</p>
<p>CORRECTION: The Atlanta Falcons are this season’s NFC South champions, not the NFC North champions.</p>

<p>Odell Beckham Jr. is undeniably one of the most electric, dynamic and talented players in the NFL. He is ― as I wrote earlier this season ― also an extremely emotional and, at times, immature football player.</p>
<p>For those living under a rock, the wide receiver subjected himself to endless scrutiny when he traveled to Miami last Monday during the New York Giants’ off day. The 24-year-old lightning rod was seen posing shirtless with other Giants receivers and also at a club mixing it up with the likes of Justin Bieber.</p>
<p>In his first-ever playoff game Sunday night in Green Bay, Wisconsin, he dropped two passes ― one that killed a drive on third down and the other a possible touchdown. And then there was a third pass that many people considered a drop. In total, he had a measly four catches for 28 yards. It was the second-lowest yardage output of his career. As a point of reference, consider that he had eight drops on 107 “catchable passes” during the regular season, per Pro Football Focus. </p>
<p>The thing about being a superstar player is that the responsibility to produce ― particularly in the postseason ― is immense. And Beckham has established himself as a true superstar, earning Second-Team All-Pro honors in consecutive years. Yet, through a series of petulant antics, he has also put a bull’s-eye on his back. Of course, Beckham is hardly the first marquee player to party before a key game, and we know he won’t be the last.</p>
<p>“It started before the game,” Beckham said of the disapproving Miami talk. “It happened early, and it did a great job of putting it in people’s minds that, ‘Okay now if the Giants lose, it’s because you went to Miami.’”</p>
<p>“There was nothing that could connect seven days ago to today and how we came out and played and executed. There’s just nothing in the world, it’s not realistic.”</p>
<p>However, amid the social media firestorm, the Louisiana native forgot about where his obligation lies. Truth be told, it’s not even about the boat. The picture and the video were not ideal, but the way it played with teammates, coaches and fans was even more important. Even if Beckham’s intentions were good, and even if he had played well, traveling to Miami six days before playing at Lambeau Field is seen as just plain wrong. That’s the type of activity that should be reserved for the offseason.</p>
<p>This does not mean Beckham cost his team the game ― a 38-13 Packers win. An ineffective offensive line, a critical injury to starting cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and an onslaught of conservative play-calling by head coach Ben McAdoo were all contributing factors. Moreover, we will never really know for sure how much No. 13 and his off-field distractions cost his team.</p>
<p>All we can do now is hope that OBJ ― whom ESPN reported punched a hole into a wall ― learns from his mistake and that a potentially brilliant career isn’t further hindered by poor decisions. </p>
<p>“These are the learning experiences, as tough as they are, this is what you stand on and grow from,” Beckham added. “It sucks. There’s no way to put it. It sucks. It’s a horrible feeling.”</p>

<p>Jan 7 (The Sports Xchange) - The Houston Texans, behind a defense that smothered rookie Oakland quarterback Connor Cook throughout, cruised to a 27-14 victory over the Raiders in an AFC wild card playoff game in Houston on Saturday.</p>
<p>Cook, a fourth-round pick out of Michigan State, looked every bit like a third-stringer pressed into emergency duty, completing 18 of 45 passes for 161 yards with a touchdown and three interceptions.</p>
<p>With starter Derek Carr (leg) and backup Matt McGloin (shoulder) out, Cook was the lone option. The Texans, who led the NFL in total defense for the first time in franchise history, showed Cook no mercy.</p>
<p>“We make it difficult on a lot of quarterbacks,” Texans coach Bill O’Brien said. “I think the guy (Cook) has a future in this league. He completed some passes and had some nice plays. We have a good scheme and more importantly than that, we have a bunch of good players. Guys that play good team defense.”</p>
<p>Making their first postseason appearance since the Super Bowl following the 2002 season, the Raiders did not eclipse 100 total yards until their first possession of the fourth quarter, doing so on a 10-yard pass from Cook to tight end Mychal Rivera that also marked their first third-down conversion following an 0 for 11 start.</p>
<p>During an eight-possession stretch bracketed by their two touchdowns in the first and fourth periods, the Raiders punted eight times, produced just three first downs, and amassed 28 net yards on 28 plays. The Raiders finished 2 of 16 on third downs and averaged just 2.9 yards per play.</p>
<p>“It was his first start, on the road, in a playoff game, against the No. 1-ranked defense,” Raiders coach Jack Del Rio said of Cook. “It was a tough draw for him.</p>
<p>“We had hopes that we would be able to do enough around him so he wouldn’t have to do as much.”</p>
<p>By the time Cook found some rhythm and engineered an 11-play, 75-yard touchdown drive in the fourth, Houston led by 20 points behind a solid performance from quarterback Brock Osweiler.</p>
<p>Osweiler reclaimed his starting job when Tom Savage suffered a concussion last week at Tennessee and he made the most of his second opportunity, passing for 168 yards and a touchdown. He added a rushing touchdown for a 27-7 lead with 12:28 to play, eluding Raiders linebacker Cory James in the open field before scrambling into the end zone. In guiding the Texans to a 20-7 halftime lead, Osweiler posted a 110.0 passer rating and did not commit a turnover. He was, for once, the picture of consistency.</p>
<p>“It just goes back to having confidence in my teammates,” Osweiler said. “Believing in what you see and just rip it. Cut it loose and don’t have any hesitation. I trust that my teammates, the skill guys, they’re going to be where they’re supposed to be ... and they’re going to make me look good in the end.”</p>
<p>The Texans will face either New England or Kansas City in the divisional round next weekend.</p>

<p>Robert Marchand has spun himself into the record books.</p>
<p>The 105-year-old Frenchman set a new world record on Wednesday when he cycled 22.547 kilometers (about 14 miles) in an hour, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>The centenarian completed 92 laps while a crowd chanted “Robert! Robert!” at Velodrome National, a state-of-the-art indoor track outside Paris that hosts elite cycling events.</p>
<p>Marchand said he didn’t even see the 10-minute warning sign during the event.</p>
<p>“Otherwise I would have gone faster,” he told the AP. “I would have posted a better time. I’m now waiting for a rival.”</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurosport, he elaborated on his feelings about the win.</p>
<p>“I am not here to be champion. I am here to prove that at 105 years old you can still ride a bike,” he said.</p>
<p>As if his record-breaking race weren’t magnificent in its own right, Marchand hasn’t even been cycling constantly his whole life. Having worked as a firefighter, a truck driver and a lumberjack, he only took up cycling again when he was 68 years old. Since then, he’s managed feats like riding from Moscow to Paris (about 1,800 miles by car).</p>
<p>Marchand’s coach and friend Gerard Mistler told the AP that the cyclist can attribute his athleticism to eating fruits and vegetables, not smoking, drinking wine in moderation, exercising daily and going to bed at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Oh, and reading.</p>
<p>“Reading a lot keeps his mind alert,” Mistler said. “He does not watch much TV, apart from the Tour de France stages.”</p>
<p>Well, excuse us. We’ll just be readjusting our 2017 resolutions while we still can.</p>

<p>When Aaron Rodgers led the Green Bay Packers to their fourth Super Bowl title (and 13th NFL championship) in 2011, he did it despite his team being the sixth and lowest seed in the NFC. That year, the Packers had to win three road games just to earn the right to play Pittsburgh in the big game. That’s the beauty of this single-elimination tournament: It doesn’t matter how you got here. It just matters that you’re here. </p>
<p>Wild Card weekend 2017, which kicks off this Saturday, will feature two of the hottest teams in the NFL. The Steelers boast a seven-game win streak and feature a trio of superstars, including unlikely MVP candidate Antonio Brown. But while Pittsburgh undoubtedly deserves our attention, let’s also take a moment to examine why the boys in green have become such a hot ticket.</p>
<p>It all starts and ends with Aaron Rodgers ― the likely league MVP, and for good reason. His 40 touchdown passes are the most in pro football, and during Green Bay’s last six games ― all wins ― the 33-year-old signal caller has amassed 18 touchdowns and zero interceptions. However, it’d be wrong to simply dismiss the Pack as a one-dimensional, aerial attacking team. </p>
<p>Longtime defensive coordinator Dom Capers has found the magic touch once more, and he’s done so after an ominous stretch where his defense flat-out couldn’t get off the field.</p>
<p>The turnaround was heralded by a crucial December thrashing of NFC West champ Seattle, when the Seahawks mustered a measly 10 points and confused Russell Wilson to the tune of a career-worst five interceptions. Then, with the division on the line at Detroit in Week 17, Capers ― despite losing three cornerbacks in the game to injury ― coerced Lions MVP candidate Matthew Stafford into several third down errant throws and a crucial pick.</p>
<p>Maybe the most surprisingly effective element for Green Bay, though, has been the running game, once completely dormant following the season-ending injury to starting back Eddie Lacy, along with a knee injury to backup James Starks.</p>
<p>Head coach Mike McCarthy has preached offensive balance, but for much of the season, he simply couldn’t find a shred of it. During Green Bay’s four-game losing streak ― three of which were at the hands of non-playoff teams ― Rodgers averaged over 43 pass attempts per game and twice led the Packers in rushing, which is never a good sign. In fact, only twice all year have the Packers recorded a 100-yard rusher. </p>
<p>And yet, great teams adjust. They find ways to achieve success ― check out my appearance on NFL Network ― even when it’s not how they originally conceived it.</p>
<p>The oft-maligned McCarthy, to his credit, has done just that, discovering a legitimate solution in converted wide receiver Ty Montgomery. The second-year pro has become an explosive weapon who possesses surprisingly good vision out of the backfield.</p>
<p>In fact, Pro Football Focus lists the former Stanford standout as the shiftiest running back in the league this season. No. 88 ― and yes, that should probably be changed to a number more befitting of a running back ― galloped for 163 yards and two touchdowns in a recent win over Chicago. Moreover, he has averaged a healthy 5.9 yards per rush, which would rank him first in the NFL if he had the qualified number of carries (100).</p>
<p>“To me, him getting over that hurdle is been what I’ve been the most impressed of because I mean, he’s a football player,” McCarthy told Detroit media ahead of the Lions game. “We’ve always played him in there situationally or schematically as a change up, so you could always see the playmaking ability. But to do the every-day, all-three-downs nuances of the running back position has been very impressive. That’s just a real credit to him.”</p>
<p>This is not to say Montgomery is better than otherwordly talents like Ezekiel Elliott or Le’Veon Bell. But his stellar play has undeniably provided the Packers with a dynamic threat lined up behind Rodgers. Better still, he has morphed into a terrific complement to the play-making Jordy Nelson (league-leading 14 touchdown catches) and Davante Adams (12 TDs) on the perimeter.</p>
<p>The result has been a far more balanced and effective offense.</p>
<p>During the team’s six-game winning streak, Rodgers has averaged 33 throws per game, 10 less than the 43 he was attempting during the Pack’s quartet of consecutive defeats, when they were seemingly out of the postseason race. </p>
<p>CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article said that the Packers won their second Super Bowl and 11th NFL title championship in 2011. In fact, it was their fourth Super Bowl victory and 13th league championship.</p>

<p>I have a lot of pet peeves when it comes to athletes when they’re training including standing around before drills (no intensity), chatting it up with teammates when they’re about to begin practice (no focus), and half-hearted effort at the beginning of workouts (competitions can be lost in the few minutes). But I now have added a new pet peeve that has quickly risen to the top of my list; namely, athletes having their phones with them and checking their social media during practice and at competitions.</p>
<p>This pet peeve extends far beyond the training and competitive settings in which athletes perform and into their daily lives. The last generation or two (those who grew up after the iPhone was invented) have become addicted to social media including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, texting, and others. When I use the word “addicted”, I mean literally so; research has demonstrated that social media has the same neurochemical effect on the brain as drugs, alcohol, and gambling.</p>
<p>A broader discussion of the role of technology in human development is beyond the scope of this article, but there are some real implications of media overuse and misuse on the lives and development of athletes and that is what I’m going to explore here.</p>
<p>Let’s return to my newest pet peeve, namely, the apparent inability of most young athletes to disconnect from their phones, even during practice. So, you may wonder, how is this incessant use of media impacting athletes?</p>
<p>The biggest area in which athletes are finding more and more difficulty is in the simple act of focusing. Considerable research has found that the attention spans of young people have decreased since the rise of smartphones and social media. Because of the distractions caused by the constant pinging, buzzing, and vibrating of social media notifications, not to mention the FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) effect, young people are losing the ability to stay focused for extended periods. The result has been a decline in study habits, learning, and grades.</p>
<p>This problem is no less evident and no less of a problem in sports. Many coaches in recent years have told me that their athletes are far less able to focus compared to previous generations. The consensus is that athletes in general these days are less able to pay attention to their coaches’ instructions, remember the feedback, and stay focused throughout a practice session.</p>
<p>One of the most common reasons young athletes come to me is because they say they have trouble focusing on what they’re working on in practice and they make mistakes in competitions because they lose focus. And in recent years, I have also found that young athletes have a much more difficult time staying focused during imagery sessions I conduct with them. Many tell me that their minds drift off quickly (often to what might be happening in cyberspace) and they’re not able to maintain or regain their focus on their sports imagery easily.</p>
<p>Why is focus so important in sports? Well, the ability to focus is the foundation of so many things related to consistent athletic performance. Focus impacts learning; without the capacity for sustained focus, athletes will forget what they are working on technically or tactically during practice. As soon as athletes lose focus, they stop doing whatever they were working on and further ingrain old and bad skills and habits. And, without that extended focus, they won’t be able to gain enough quality repetition necessary to effectively ingrain new skills and habits.</p>
<p>Focus plays a big role on the day of a competition as well. First, focus is important for pre-competitive strategy. Your ability to focus influences your memory of your game plan. Focus is also important during the competition. Without consistent focus from beginning to end, whether on technique, tactics, or just performing your best, you have little chance to perform up to your fullest ability.</p>
<p>Now, I can’t realistically get athletes to set limits on media use away from their sport. At the same time, I would like to make some reasonable suggestions that athletes, coaches, and sports programs can implement to at least keep the tech monster at bay while athletes are practicing and competing.</p>
<p>First, a few thoughts for athletes. Away from your sport, a consistent program of mental imagery is one of the best antidotes to the loss of focus due to excessive media use. When you do imagery, you are, by its very nature, requiring yourself to focus, thereby exercising your focus muscle and training it to focus from the start to the finish of your imagined performances.</p>
<p>I do understand that many of you use your smartphone as a mental tool on game day, mainly by listening to music to help you stay positive, adjust your intensity, establish a good mindset, and to create healthy distractions that keep you from thinking too much about the upcoming competition. I totally support that. But when it comes to practice, do you really need to listen to music during breaks? Do you really need to be checking your social media while resting? I would encourage you to ask yourself what will and will not help you to stay focused in practice and consider leaving your phone in your gear bag when you head out for practice.</p>
<p>Second, for coaches. You should have a conversation with your athletes in which you educate them about the importance of focus and talk to them about how media during practice and competitions can help or hurt their preparations and performances. See if you can come to some consensus on how, when, and where they use their media that will actually help them to perform their best.</p>
<p>Third, for programs. At the club, team, or academy level, I would recommend that you assemble a committee of coaches, parents, and athletes to create some guidelines that can help shape the culture of media use in your program. These guidelines will act as the norms and defaults for media use, so athletes will be more likely to adhere to them.</p>
<p>As we all know, sports can involve minute differences between winning and losing. Any advantage you can gain that will enable you to perform just a little bit better can make a big difference at the end of a day of competition. One simple, yet powerful, advantage you can gain is to be able to focus effectively in practice and to be totally focused from start to finish in competitions. A key tool you can use to improve your focus is, in my humble opinion, to turn your phone off during practice and use it only as a tool, rather than a toy, on game day.</p>

<p>It might seem preposterous to suggest that The Associated Press should name a wide receiver the NFL’s MVP of the year. After all, the AP introduced its prize in 1957 and has never given it to a wide receiver ― not even in 1987, when several other sports journalism groups bestowed the honor on Jerry Rice. But 28-year-old Antonio Brown of the Pittsburgh Steelers deserves the recognition as much as anyone this season. </p>
<p>Let’s start with the obvious: His 106 catches (on 155 targets) rank second in the league and his 1,284 yards (he didn’t play in Week 17) slot him fourth. In fact, this is the fourth consecutive year that Brown has eclipsed the 100-catch barrier, tying an NFL record set by former Indianapolis Colts great and future Hall of Famer Marvin Harrison.</p>
<p>Better yet, in an offense starving for big plays, the Central Michigan product ranks third with 22 catches of 20 yards or more, trailing only T.Y. Hilton and Julio Jones. As a reference point, consider that other elite wide receivers like Mike Evans, A.J. Green, DeAndre Hopkins, Kelvin Benjamin, Allen Robinson, Brandon Marshall, Brandin Cooks and Demaryius Thomas all have 15 or less.</p>
<p>Plenty of credit for Brown’s production should go to his superstar quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger. But also remember that Pittsburgh severely lacks a second option at receiver. Dynamic deep threat Martavis Bryant is suspended for the year, Sammie Coates has been injured and second-year man Eli Rogers is a mixed bag. Versatile All-World running back Le’Veon Bell assumes the role at times, although Brown draws the top cornerback every week and often absorbs double coverage, only to beat it nearly every week.</p>
<p>Brown, a former sixth-round pick, separates himself with his impeccable route running and a remarkable consistency to flat out catch the football. While No. 84 has been targeted on about 25 percent of Roethlisberger’s throws, he has dropped just two passes all season. In fact, the wideout’s 1.3 percent drop rate is fourth-best in the league for receivers with at least 60 catches (behind Doug Baldwin, Stefon Diggs and Pierre Garcon), according to SportingCharts.com. Simply put, nobody ― regardless of position ― is steadier or more lethal on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>Perhaps the real genius of the 5-foot-10, 181-pound Brown ― well on his way to a fourth straight All-Pro selection ― is the sheer timeliness of his receptions.</p>
<p>Take into consideration Pittsburgh’s crucial Week 16 comeback against Baltimore to clinch an AFC North title and, in turn, a playoff bid. With no timeouts left and the season dwindling, Brown’s Herculean effort to find the end zone sealed a 31-27 win. Moreover, his stellar play in the clutch is a key reason why Big Ben ranks second in the league in fourth-quarter quarterback rating.</p>
<p>Additionally, Brown is second in the league for catches for first downs ― with 64, he’s behind only Tampa Bay’s resurgent Mike Evans ― and his 12 touchdown catches trail only Green Bay’s Jordy Nelson.</p>
<p>Of course, realistically we know that the chances of Brown (and his unmistakeable touchdown celebrations) capturing MVP honors are extremely low, particularly with the sizzling play of Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady.</p>
<p>The last non-QB to win the award was Vikings running back Adrian Peterson in 2012, when he had one of the single greatest seasons in NFL history. But the Steelers are legitimate Super Bowl contenders and Brown might be the most important reason for that. At the very least, that has to cement him firmly into the conversation for pro football’s highest honor.</p>

<p>With Rousey favored in her return fight, 13-months following a devastating loss at UFC 193, Nunes seized the opportunity to defend her title for the first time after winning the belt at UFC 200.</p>
<p>Straight from the opening bell, Nunes attacked Rousey with heavy strikes. Pushing forward and landing clean punches, Nunes stunned Rousey, forcing the former champion to backpedal. But Nunes continued her pressure and caught Rousey, who resorted to briefly holding the cage to maintain her balance.</p>
<p>The Brazilian is now 7-1 inside the Octagon, having won five straight contests. Nunes also becomes the first fighter to successfully defend the women's bantamweight title following Rousey's loss to Holly Holm in November 2015, earning a Performance of the Night bonus in the process.</p>
<p>"I know the girls can't take my punches," stated Nunes following the fight. "I know she's gonna strike a little bit with me, but she see when I start to connect so much I know she's gonna try to clinch with me."</p>
<p>In the evening's co-main event, undefeated bantamweight Cody Garbrandt transitioned from prospect into champion, as he dethroned Dominick Cruz, a two time UFC titleist, via unanimous decision.</p>
<p>Leading up to the fight, Cruz's experience, along with his unique and elusive style, had him pegged as the clear favorite. But Garbrandt's powerful hands became the deciding factor as he swept the scorecards, 48-47, 48-46, 48-46. The bout was named the UFC 207 Fight of the Night.</p>
<p>Garbrandt fired early, and often, dropping Cruz on numerous occasions. However, Cruz used his signature footwork and feints to set up a takedown in the opening round. Garbrandt returned the favor before the end of the first frame, in what would be the closest round of the five-round fight.</p>
<p>With a massive cut opening up along Cruz's eyebrow in the third round, Garbrandt continued his forward pressure, trading in the pocket, while routinely taunting and calling the fight back to the center of the Octagon.</p>
<p>In the fourth, Garbrandt delivered his most dominant round, knocking Cruz to the canvas on three occasions. Still, Cruz returned to his feet to trade punches and kicks with Garbrandt, going the distance.</p>
<p>Garbrandt now becomes the fourth UFC bantamweight champion in history, joining Cruz, Renan Barao, and T.J. Dillashaw as the only fighters to hold the title.</p>
<p>"I've been waiting to hear that since I was 12 years old," commented Garbrandt. "I grew up fighting, it's all I know. Hats off to Dominick Cruz and his team at Alliance. He's one of the best in the world and now I'm the best in the world. T.J. Dillashaw, come try me."  Dillashaw did his part earlier in the night, dominating John Lineker en route to a unanimous decision.</p>
<p>Using his feints and fakes to set up his takedown game, Dillashaw controlled the entirety of the fifteen-minute contest, nullifying Lineker's heavy hands and winging hooks.</p>
<p>In the second stanza, Dillashaw was particularly brilliant, battering Lineker with elbows and punches on the ground, taking the round 10-8. Dillashaw continued to impress in the third, and finishes the year with back-to-back wins, while distinguishing himself as the division's number-one contender.</p>
<p>"I had nothing to prove, I just had to fight a tough guy. John Lineker is a beast," stated Dillashaw. "I had to be smart. I'm not going to get into a slugfest with the guy, it's his only weapon. I wanted to show how well-rounded I am."</p>
<p>In a battle of top-15 welterweights, Korea's Dong Hyun Kim took a split verdict over Belgium-born Tarec Saffiedine.</p>
<p>With the majority of the fight taking place in the clinch, both Kim and Saffiedine traded punches and kicks with neither man taking clear control of the bout. And while Kim and Saffiedine landed shots and secured takedowns, the action stalled in the second round.</p>
<p>The third frame began with a flurry of punches, as both Kim and Saffiedine, ranked ninth and twelfth, respectively, attempted to take control. But, the fight went the distance, and the split verdict was lopsided, with one judge awarding all three rounds to Saffiedine, while Kim took two out of three rounds on the other two cards.</p>
<p>"I watched the previous fights and I thought that I could win Fight of the Night," stated Kim. "But Saffiedine has a great clinch game so it was hard to perform an exciting fight."</p>
<p>Kicking of the UFC 207 main card, flyweight Ray Borg returned to the win column, dominating Louis Smolka for the entire three rounds.</p>
<p>Landing takedowns early, Borg capitalized on short grounded elbows and greuling tops position to control Smolka from the onset.</p>
<p>Attempting a rarely seen omoplata in the first round, Borg, who badly injured his ankle in the second round, swept the scorecards, cruising to a unanimous decision win, 30-27, 30-26, 30-26.</p>
<p>The loss marks a second straight for Smolka, who scrambled throughout the contest while attempting submission. But Borg's boxing and top game was too strong, rolling with every Smolka sweep.</p>
<p>"I expected it to be a grappling match," stated Borg. "I expected him to scramble more and be a little bit stronger. It was a good fight by Louis." </p>
<p>Capping off the evening's preliminary card, welterweight Neil Magny recorded a unanimous decision win over former UFC champion Johny Hendricks.</p>
<p>Using his sizeable reach to keep Hendricks on the outside, Magny utilized a vast array of kicking techniques. But Hendricks would eventually find his way into striking range and set up his takedown game, converting on multiple attempts throughout the contest.</p>
<p>However, Magny remained calm on the bottom, and was able to contort himself into position for a pair of triangle-choke submission attempts in the first and third rounds, delivering elbows and punches in volume.</p>
<p>And while Magny was unable to secure the submission, his diverse striking and submission attempts put him over the top on the judges' scorecards.</p>
<p>"It is a mixed martial arts match, not a wrestling match. I definitely lost the wrestling match in that fight, but I won the striking and jiu jitsu aspects of it and that's what got me the win today," offered Magny following the fight. "I had myself winning rounds one and three, for sure. I know in round two I was put in a lot of bad positions and I wasn't able to get my offense going, but I feel like I was the more offensive guy in both rounds one and three."</p>
<p>Moving forward following the most successful year in the company's history, the UFC begins its 2017 campaign on January 15 in Phoenix, Arizona with a rare Sunday show, as former two-division champion B.J. Penn makes his long-awaited return to the Octagon following two-and-a-half years away from the cage. Penn takes on undefeated prospect Yair Rodriguez.</p>

<p>After the quarterback for the Philadelphia Eagles purchased shotguns for his offensive line this Christmas, a gun violence prevention group has also sent the players a gift: gun locks.</p>
<p>Rookie quarterback Carson Wentz got his players Beretta shotguns, each weapon personalized with the player’s number engraved on the butt of the gun, ESPN reports. In one sense, it marked the first time all season the quarterback actually had weapons around him (the Eagles are currently 6-9).</p>
<p>CeaseFire PA, the advocacy group, sent the gun locks to help remind the players to be responsible gun owners.</p>
<p>“Our staff’s immediate reaction to the news about Wentz’s gifts to his teammates was to ensure that the gifts were used safely and responsibly,” Shira Goodman, the group’s executive director, said in a statement.</p>
<p>There are a number of different types of gun locks, and it’s not clear which kind the group provided to the players. CeaseFire PA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Just last month, Eagles wide receiver Josh Huff was arrested and later cut from the team after he was charged with possessing an unloaded 9 mm handgun without a permit. Police said they also found a magazine that had six hollow-point bullets. </p>
<p>“I’m a professional athlete,” Huff said after the incident. “What professional athlete don’t have a gun? I have a wife and I have a son at home. My job is to protect them at all costs, and my job is to protect myself as well, even though I know I have security here, but I have to protect myself as well.”</p>
<p>CeaseFire PA has encouraged the gun owners to enroll in safety courses. In an informal poll of 37 Eagles players conducted by The Philadelphia Inquirer, 18 players said they owned a gun.</p>
<p>The Eagles have not yet responded to the group’s gift.</p>
<p>“We want them and their families to all be in top condition for next season,” Goodman said in the statement. “We welcome all Eagles players and fans to become our partners in working for a safer Pennsylvania.” </p>

<p>Seattle Seahawks standout defensive end Michael Bennett has agreed to a three-year, $31.5 million contract extension with the team, according to a source with knowledge of the agreement who spoke to The Huffington Post.</p>
<p>The contract reportedly includes $17.5 million in guarantees and bonuses. Bennett will earn $16 million in 2017 and $19 million by March of 2018, the source told HuffPost.</p>
<p>The deal is unheard of for a soon-to-be 32-year-old defensive linemen. It is also unique for the team, which has never done a deal with a player who has at least one year remaining on his contract. (Bennett had been signed through next season.)</p>
<p>Bennett was previously the 27th-highest paid defensive linemen in the NFL. He held out briefly during training camp with the hopes of inking an extension, telling HuffPost, “You definitely want to get what you think you’re worth. When you put all the things together, I just don’t see a lot of guys having the type of impact I have.”</p>
<p>Bennett helped the Seahawks lead the league in total defense over each of the last four seasons, including their Super Bowl victory over Denver. A Pro Bowl selection in 2015 and 2016, he has become one of the league’s premier two-way defensive ends, ranking first in quarterback hurries for all 4-3 defensive ends last year.</p>
<p>Last offseason, Bennett skipped voluntary workouts but showed up for a mandatory minicamp and training camp. His production has been down in 2016, but only because he was hit by a series of injuries. He had to miss five games after undergoing knee surgery following a Week 6 game against Atlanta, and then suffered a neck injury in Seattle’s Week 15 win over the Rams. </p>
<p>But when he’s been on the field, Bennett’s been terrific, tallying a slew of sacks and stops in the backfield.</p>
<p>The decision to extend Bennett’s contract comes after the team has agreed to long-term extensions with linebackers Bobby Wagner and K.J. Wright, along with defensive backs Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor and Earl Thomas ― all elite players at their respective positions. Head coach Pete Carroll told HuffPost before the season, “We’re gonna make an effort ― an effort so he remains a Seahawk.”</p>
<p>Undrafted in 2009 out of Texas A&M, Bennett was originally signed by the Seahawks before establishing himself as a legitimate starter with Tampa Bay. Then, he returned to Seattle in 2013, where he’s been a constant wrecking force ever since. </p>
<p>The 9-5-1 Seahawks recently earned an NFC West championship for the third time in four years. Carroll and General Manager John Schneider hope that a happy and healthy Bennett means even more production for the league’s second-best scoring defense, and in turn, another deep postseason run. </p>

<p>The third year of the College Football Playoff offers its biggest point spread yet. There’s a 16-point line separating undefeated Alabama from 12-1 Washington as they prepare to meet in Saturday’s national semifinal game at the Peach Bowl.</p>
<p>Point spreads don’t tell the whole story.</p>
<p>Yes, the Crimson Tide, hoping to capture back-to-back national titles, have been the undisputed No. 1 all season ― despite being led by the first true freshman quarterback ever to start under head coach Nick Saban in Tuscaloosa.</p>
<p>The fourth-ranked Huskies, meanwhile, nearly missed out on the playoff all together to a two-loss Penn State team. Washington’s head coach, Chris Petersen, recently said of his team’s upcoming opponent, “There’s no weaknesses out there.” And he may be right.</p>
<p>But if you’re ready to write off Petersen’s Huskies, look at history: His teams thrive on that. </p>
<p>So here are three reasons why the Pac-12 champs could actually topple the heavy favorites out of the SEC ― and deny Saban his sixth national title overall and fifth with the Tide.</p>
<p>Quarterback Edge</p>
<p>Despite a sluggish two-game stretch, Washington’s sophomore quarterback, Jake Browning, has thrown touchdown passes at a higher rate than anyone else in NCAA history. He has tossed a Huskies-record 42 touchdown passes (putting him second nationally this season), to go along with his 176.5 QBR (the fifth best in college football). Browning, who also holds the national prep record for touchdown passes, was the rare recruit who spurned Alabama’s offer.</p>
<p>We knew the team would be really good this year in large part because Browning plays just like Petersen coaches: impossibly steady, focused on finding ways ― sometimes unconventional ― to win. Boosted by a superb offensive line, Browning is a beacon of accuracy and just mobile enough to escape pressure.</p>
<p>It’s true that Alabama has the best defensive line in college football, and perhaps the best player, too, in supremely gifted defensive tackle Jonathan Allen, the Chuck Bednarik Award winner as the nation’s best defensive player. But given Browning’s ability to withstand a murky pocket, he represents one of Washington’s undisputed advantages.</p>
<p>The Tide’s freshman quarterback, Jalen Hurts, has proved a dual threat, with 22 passing touchdowns and 12 rushing. But he’s also prone to erratic stretches, as we saw in the Ole Miss and Texas A&M games. And he’s tied for worst in the country with 10 fumbles.</p>
<p>Plus, Hurts hasn’t been asked to play from behind much. Browning has a tendency to put pressure on opposing offenses: The Huskies offense averages 44.5 points per game, good enough for fourth best in the FBS rankings.</p>
<p>Turnover Margin</p>
<p>The Huskies are down a couple of terrific players defensively in injured linebackers Azeem Victor and Joe Mathis. Even still, their dynamic blend of team speed and ability to rally to the football have helped them earn a plus-21 in turnover margin, which is the best in the country. Not coincidentally, they also rank in the top 10 nationally for third down defense. </p>
<p>And the Huskies have done it by employing legitimate NFL talent at every level of that defense. The secondary offers their best crop of talent, led by First-Team All-American safety Budda Baker, along with corners Sidney Jones and Kevin King. Jones, who is a Sports Illustrated Second-Team All-American, is perhaps the best cover man in America. An NFL general manager was gushing to me recently over his ability.</p>
<p>The Huskies are an extremely sound tackling group and pride themselves on putting pressure on quarterbacks. Hurts will have to be careful with the football, because his opponent has a slew of ball hawks. Freshman All-American safety Taylor Rapp, in particular, is coming off a two-interception game, including a pick-six, against Colorado in the Pac-12 title match.</p>
<p>For his part, Browning has tossed just seven interceptions all year.</p>
<p>The Big Play!</p>
<p>As good a bowl coach as Saban has been, Petersen, with two Fiesta Bowl wins at Boise State, isn’t too shabby either. We can expect an onslaught of creativity from him.</p>
<p>Watch out for what he does with wide receiver/speed demon John Ross III, the AP Pac-12 Player of the Year and First-Team All-American, who has scored 17 touchdowns this year. Keep an eye, too, on Dante Pettis, a dynamic wideout who can make spectacular plays. He owns the school record with five career punt returns for TDs, including the game-winner over Utah above.</p>
<p>But the overlooked power of the Huskies is their running game. Petersen leans on two very capable, very different backs ― strong and shifty sophomore Myles Gaskin (1,339 yards, 10 TDs) and junior Lavon Coleman (an average 7.8 yards per carry).</p>
<p>Trick plays will most definitely be on the table as well ― to neutralize Alabama’s beef up front and maximize Washington’s sensational speed. The Huskies won’t hold anything back, which means fans should look for the craziest of upsets in Atlanta.</p>

<p>The Denver Broncos got a big lump of coal on Christmas Day when the Kansas City Chiefs gave ‘em a good ol’ fashioned American drubbing ― they lost 33-10, and even my mom was embarrassed for them. But it was a Broncos fan who suffered the worst sack of the game.</p>
<p>With a few seconds left in the third quarter on Sunday, a Kansas City security guard deployed a diving, crushing tackle on the fan as he ran across the field.</p>
<p>During the national broadcast of the game, Westwood One radio’s Kevin Harlan celebrated the sack with a hilarious play-by-play (watch and listen here).</p>
<p>“Merry Christmas, my friend!” Harlan exclaimed, after predicting that the downed fan would spend the night in jail.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are a lot more recordings of Harlan calling play-by-plays when fans take the field. Take the Jets game earlier this month:</p>

<p>(Reuters) - The Minnesota Vikings endured a scary moment on Friday when their team plane slid off the runway while taxiing following a safe landing in Appleton, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>“While taxiing after a safe landing, the team plane slid off the runway and became stuck,” the team said on their Twitter page. “Back at the team hotel, the #Vikings are nestled, all snug in their beds,” they added.</p>
<p>Last month, 71 people died when a plane carrying players, directors and staff of the Brazilian soccer club Chapecoense crashed into a mountain outside Medellin.</p>
<p>Navigating a snowy night at Appleton International Airport, the plane slid from the runway and into grass. Everyone on the plane was safe but the Vikings experienced a two-hour delay following the incident as a fire truck was needed to remove passengers from the plane. Several Vikings players used social media to describe the experience.</p>

Tures, ContributorPolitical science professor, LaGrange College in Georgia">
<p>Earlier this year, conservatives like John Hawkins with Townhall.com took to the Internet to call for a boycott of the NFL over its refusal to punish San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick for taking a knee during the National Anthem. But research shows that such boycott efforts are fading, and interest in the NFL has rebounded, and even increased in some cases.</p>
<p>The boycott movement got its start when Kaepernick refused to take a stand during the National Anthem. More accurately, he took a knee, a means of protesting the many police shootings of African-American males.</p>
<p>In addition to calling for a boycott, supporters have claimed their efforts succeeded. They pointed to Rasmussen Reports polls showing more Americans were choosing not to watch the National Football League games. They even cheered as reports surfaced that professional football viewership was falling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, defenders of the NFL's decision not to punish Kaepernick claimed that lower ratings were due to a lot of interest in baseball's historic contest between two long-suffering franchises: the Chicago Cubs versus the Cleveland Indians, as well as greater interest in the heated battle between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (Democrat) and tycoon Donald Trump (Republican).</p>
<p>Earlier in the season, I examined the data for myself. I discovered that (1) National Football League (NFL) attendance was higher in 2016 than for 2015, during the same time frame. I also discovered that (2) the measures of TV viewership failed to account for those streaming games. Both could explain the decline in television attendance, in addition to the other factors.</p>
<p>But boycott supporters remained unconvinced, sending me emails convinced that the decline in TV ratings was proof of their power, as well as evidence that the NFL should agree with them in their hard-line approach to player protests or involvement in causes.</p>
<p>So I decided to take them up on their challenge, and look directly at television ratings from Sports Media Watch. And this is what I found.</p>
<p>From weeks one through seven, ratings were down. In the majority of cases, 2016 TV ratings were off from the previous year for the first few games. There were more games below 2015 numbers than above them. Of course, when games like the Atlanta-New Orleans contest went up against the Clinton-Trump debate, the ratings did suffer. And yes, one of the biggest declines occurred for the game between the 49ers and Los Angeles Rams.</p>
<p>That changed in Week 8. From Weeks 8 through 14, TV viewership of NFL games that are higher in 2016 than in 2015 exceed those down from last year. As the election and exciting World Series concluded, the numbers returned to the NFL, as predicted by its supporters. Even if it didn't it showed the boycott, if it did exist, certainly lost steam. And Business Insider, with Yahoo, concurs in my analysis of the NFL ratings rebound.</p>
<p>The fact that Donald Trump was running ads to reach supporters during NFL games shows evidence that even this conservative candidate, who had called out Kaepernick, wasn't buying the boycott.</p>
<p>Closer analysis indicate that the games (above or below 2015 numbers) are seem dependent upon the matchup, with games incorporating teams with losing records struggling, while those with playoff teams seem to be doing better. It may seem obvious, but I don't remember those calling for a boycott limiting their protest to contests between poorly-performing teams. Did people skip the 49ers-Rams game because of Kaepernick, or because both teams were awful? </p>
<p>Moreover, Sports Media Watch data (from the networks) also incorporates estimates of those between 18 and 49 who are streaming the pro football games. I even tried streaming a game for myself, when my beloved Green Bay Packers weren't on TV. The quality was a bit crude, and no substitute for the original on TV, but it's effective when you need it. When taking this into effect, you can see that interest in the NFL is clearly pretty strong; some of those games that are "down" from 2015 probably aren't being boycotted.</p>
<p>And we still haven't included data from Weeks 15-17, when the playoff push reaches its zenith. Critics are sure to say that of course ratings are higher, as we are getting closer to the playoffs. But consider this: the hunt for the playoffs in 2016 is doing better than the playoff race in 2015 so far.</p>
<p>Professional football is an exciting sport. It appeals to conservatives, moderates and liberals. No protest attempt is really going to change that. The NFL boycott is not likely to be any more successful than attempts to target the musical "Hamilton" or snubbing Starbucks for their coffee cups.  John A.

<p>Kobe Bryant Retired From The NBA, But Not Before Sinking 60 Points</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant knows how to put on a show. In April, for his final NBA game, the legendary player took to the court to do one thing: demolish. The L.A. Lakers beat the Utah Jazz 101-96, a feat that would not have been possible without Kobe scoring 60 points. It’s the most points ever scored by an NBA player in his final game.</p>
<p>Even former teammate Shaquille O’Neal was stupefied.</p>
<p>LeBron James Finally Won The City Of Cleveland Its Championship </p>
<p>In a nail-biting final game between the Cleveland Cavaliers and California’s Golden State Warriors, LeBron James helped lead his team to its first championship in franchise history.</p>
<p>In their seventh game in the championship series, both teams were poised to fight. In fact, the scores were so close throughout the game that it wasn’t until Kyle Irving made a 3-pointer with 53 seconds left that the Cavaliers began to grab a noticeable lead, one that would eventually result in a 93-89 victory. James scored 27 of those points, and gave a strong showing on defense.</p>
<p>After the game, an emotional James dedicated the win to the city of Cleveland. </p>

<p>What do you call one of the greatest athletes of all time? Just that.</p>
<p>When Serena Williams dismantled her competition in the Wimbledon semifinal in July, reporters were clamoring to talk to her.</p>
<p>“There will be talk about you going down as one of the greatest female athletes of all time,” one reporter said. “What do you think when you hear someone talk like that?”</p>
<p>Without missing a beat, Williams gave the perfect response.</p>
<p>“I prefer the word ‘one of the greatest athletes of all time,’” she said. </p>
<p>We prefer that too. </p>
<p>The Cubs Won The World Series</p>
<p>Welp, there’s a sentence we never thought we’d write.</p>
<p>After 108 years, the Chicago Cubs finally got a World Series championship, beating the Cleveland Indians 8-7 during Game 7. The curse was officially broken. Even more special were all the emotional grandmas and grandpas who finally got to see the impossible happen. </p>
<p>After the game, Chicago citizens seemed fairly pleased, if the below video is any indication. </p>
<p>Miami Marlins Honored One Of Their Fallen, And We All Cried</p>
<p>Sometimes moments happen in life that simply couldn’t be more perfect if they were scripted. That was the case during the first game the Miami Marlins played after the death of star pitcher Jose Fernandez.</p>
<p>It was a death that had come suddenly, and tore a hole through the hearts of players and fans alike. Fernandez, just 24 years old, died with two others in a boating accident in September. </p>
<p>During the Marlins’ following game, second baseman Dee Gordon stepped up to the plate wearing a Fernandez jersey and hit a solo home run during the very first inning. As he rounded the bases, Gordon began to cry. His teammates began to cry. We all began to cry. </p>
<p>“Unbelievable,” an announcer said after Gordon’s hit. “Just unbelievable ― his eyes wet with emotion as he rounded the bases, his first home run of the season.” </p>
<p>The Olympics Restored Our Faith In Humanity</p>
<p>While the world around us slowly burned, the Olympics allowed a moment of respite from the chaos. </p>
<p>Michael Phelps, American merman, broke a more-than-2,000-year record for individual Olympic titles. And there was Simone Biles, the 19-year-old gymnastics superstar who crushed the women’s individual all-around to take home a gold medal. Biles finished out the year by becoming the most decorated American gymnast of all time.</p>
<p>Then there were the moments that truly encapsulated the Olympic spirit. For instance, 2016 saw the very first team of refugee athletes. The 10-person team included athletes from South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Ethiopia. </p>
<p> “These are athletes who have trained their whole lives to compete in the Olympics and they’d like nothing more than to compete under their own flags,” Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said in a video message. “But unfortunately, instead of being able to do that, they have been displaced from their homes.” President Barack Obama also cheered on the team. </p>
<p>But perhaps nothing embodied the Olympic spirit more than the selflessness of two runners who collided during Round 1 of the women’s 5,000-meter race. </p>
<p>After U.S. athlete Abbey D’Agnostino and New Zealand athlete Nikki Hamblin fell to the ground during the race, they encouraged one another to finish together.</p>
<p> “Get up, get up! We have to finish!” D’Agostino told her competitor, according to ESPN. “This is the Olympic Games. We have to finish this.” </p>
<p>Despite an injured knee, D’Agostino was able to finish in last place with the help of Hamblin. The two hugged at the finish line.</p>
<p>If that’s not beautiful enough, both runners were honored with the Fair Play Award, a sportsmanship medal that’s only been given to 17 other Olympic athletes in history.</p>
<p> “Winning this award is overwhelming,” Hamblin said at the ceremony. “I... truly believe that you can be both a competitor and kind and responsive at the same time.” Maybe everything will be OK after all. </p>

He took an important step last night by apologizing in person to Steven Santa Ana and Coach Matt Matheny. As a program, we needed to take further steps regarding his actions that do not meet the standards of Duke Basketball. To that end, we have determined that Grayson will be suspended from competition for an indefinite amount of time.” </p>

<p>With over 1,000 wins to his name, Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski is the winningest coach in NCAA Division I history. He has won five national championships ― most recently in 2015 ― and is both an inductee of the Naismith Memorial and College Basketball Halls of Fame. And, at 69 years old, the West Point graduate is hardly slowing down either. Following a recent knee replacement surgery, this season Coach K has arguably his most talented team yet, with legitimate hopes of capturing a sixth title.</p>
<p>Krzyzewski caught up with The Huffington Post to discuss guiding Team USA to three consecutive gold medals, the hardest part about keeping his program small and why recruiting today is more demanding than ever before.</p>
<p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity. </p>
<p>You’ve joined forces with Hit Play, which promotes joint replacement surgery as a way to avoid living in constant pain. Just how bad and how much pain were you in before your hip replacement surgery? I’m not sure most fans understand you were really struggling.</p>
<p>I knew that my left knee was bone-on-bone for a few years, but it was not symptomatic. My legs were strong, and for whatever reason I wasn’t having the pain. Then, during the season, my knee was literally starting to collapse a little bit, and I had to get a brace for it and wore the brace for seven, eight weeks. That first hip replacement 17 years ago taught me you don’t have to live with pain, you don’t have to live with a lack of mobility, you can get back to being normal, you just need to get this thing done. </p>
<p>Have your vulnerabilities changed how you view players who get injured?</p>
<p>Just because you play hard or get hurt as a player, that doesn’t mean you’re going to need to get joint replacement. A lot of this is just genetics.</p>
<p>I’ve always felt like you have made a cognizant effort to evolve as a coach. Duke doesn’t strictly employ man-to-man defense anymore, for example. And your offense caters more to the personnel you’ve recruited. </p>
<p>I think it’s a key for sustained success and sustained excellence ― to be a lifelong learner and also to be able to adapt to the changing cultures that the kids and the people that you have the honor to coach come from. I’ve been coaching for 42 years as a head coach, and you know, culture changes. What you teach and value ― trust, loyalty, teamwork, cooperation, hard work ― they stay the same. But the way you develop that within your group is different, same with methods of attack on offense and defense.</p>
<p>The amount of time you have with a team ― how much can you get in within that period, how many older guys do you have to teach your system? With guys leaving early you don’t have that four-year-player all the time ― especially your best player. And then I’ve learned over the last 10 years coaching the U.S. Team that you adapt everyday in dealing with men and different egos and how to get them all under one ego. Just like in physical training: What do you do now compared to what you used to do, and what did you learn? </p>
<p>How much of a challenge is it for you and Coach Capel to go after guys that could be one-and-done guys or two-year guys, when in the past you generally had more upperclassmen? </p>
<p>Well, Jordan, to be quite frank with you, they’re the same guys except that they’re leaving now. Grant Hill, Christian Laettner, Bobby Hurley ― they may have been one-and-done if they were here 25 years later. And so, we really have gone after the same type of guys, guys who are really good players, really good students, good character. That hasn’t changed.</p>
<p>It’s just that success as far as going into the NBA comes sooner for these guys now, so what we’ve had to adapt to is more recruiting year by year. I find that I’m recruiting more and more intensely than at any other time in my career, because of the frequency and the amount of work that goes into recruiting a youngster at that level.</p>
<p>How much of your experience with Team USA has helped sustain the Duke program at an even higher level?</p>
<p>I would say that success helps recruiting. In other words, if we weren’t successful in our program at Duke, we wouldn’t attract as many kids. If I coached the USA team, and LeBron James and Durant and Kobe and all those other guys said, “I hated playing for that guy,” that wouldn’t help us in recruiting. If we lost to Spain in Beijing when the score was a 2-point game, that wouldn’t help us in recruiting. But the fact is that we’ve done well. If you’re worthy of being asked to do something and have the courage to accept it, and the work ethic to make it good ― all three of those steps took place in order to have what some people think is a gift from somewhere.</p>
<p>With all of that success collegiately and internationally, how do you maintain the intimacy in your program when everything is so big? How do you keep that family atmosphere with such tremendous exposure, because I picked up on that during my first game in Cameron.</p>
<p>Well it’s a good question. First of all, it comes from people. The infrastructure of our program: It’s not my program, it’s our program. Then, the kids that we recruit are really good kids. When they’re put in this type of environment in a school as great as Duke, it helps us tremendously. They recognize they want to be a part of something bigger than them. And then what we do is we don’t think about what we’ve done, but we try to focus on what we’re doing. I don’t want a guy who might be a one-and-done thinking about going pro, just like I don’t want me thinking of retirement or thinking about what we did in Rio. Or what we did in 2015. Let’s all think about the same thing, about how this group can have an amazing experience. That can be a challenge, but it’s a challenge worth meeting and then beating.</p>
<p>How prominent a role do world events play within the framework of your team, politics for example? Do you encourage players and coaches to have these types of conversations?</p>
<p>Yeah, we talk about those things. Our guys are able to express those views, we don’t have any type of restrictions on social media, except for them to recognize that they’re not just them, they’re us. When you do say something or whatever it is, you’re part of our program and to understand that responsibility. We talk about it, whether it be HB2 or the flag situation that occurred earlier, we talk about all those things, because that’s the environment that they’re living, and we are very happy to hear their views. We don’t have an agenda or have to make a statement about everything. </p>
<p>Duke always schedules as tough as anyone else in the country. You have discussed preparing for the tournament by using the schedule to your advantage. </p>
<p>What we try to do in our non-conference scheduling is to schedule one of the top 10 schedules in the country, which we always have. But also put ourselves in situations that’ll be similar to the situations that we will have in March. Big games, big arenas, different times. We’ve played two 9:30 games, then we have to travel back to campus and get there at 4 in the morning.</p>
<p>In the NCAA Tournament, you’re going to be playing in front of neutral, huge crowds. You’re going to have games that start at noon, 10:15 at night, whatever, so we try to get our team ready for March, not so much get it ready for January. Our conference schedule will toughen us up and get us better, and so will the non-conference, but the non-conference gives us the opportunity to look at environments that we’ll see in March and hopefully ― you won’t see it in April because usually you don’t play in a dome ― but if we get that opportunity we’ll adjust to that at the moment.</p>
<p>I’ve heard you talk a lot about Steph Curry and the shockingly impressive workouts he does behind closed doors.</p>
<p>Well it’s not just that, but it’s so many of those NBA players. They have so many of their own routines that quite frankly they should be the ones to talk to you about them, not me. But it’s not what they all show in public, because it’s called personalization. What you need to personally do to get you to be your best.</p>
<p>When you’re with the U.S. team, you get to see the best practices of all the best professionals, and they can pick up from one another. They all get better. I’m not saying that I make them better, it’s just that in that specific environment they all get better because they’re able to share knowledge.</p>
<p>How much more of an emphasis have you put on nutrition and exercise?</p>
<p>Well I try to keep in the best shape that I can year-round and especially during the season. Stress relief, clear head, making sure that you are physically ready, because if you’re not physically ready it affects you mentally. That’s why I got these hips. You want to be at your best. You know when you’re suffering from that that you’re not, and it makes me angry, like I’m losing to this. So I got it done, and I feel like I’ve won. I wouldn’t be coaching if I didn’t get all these things done. No way. It would be impossible. </p>
<p>CORRECTION: A previous edition of this article incorrectly stated that Krzyzewski has won two consecutive Olympic gold medals as head coach of Team USA. It has been changed to accurately state he has won three straight golds. </p>
<p>CORRECTION: Also, the article previously stated that Coach K is a two-time inductee into the Naismith Hall of Fame. It’s been changed to accurately state he has been inducted into both the Naismith and College Basketball Halls of Fame.</p>
<p>CORRECTION: The piece has also been changed to accurately reflect that Coach K endured a recent knee replacement, not a second hip replacement.</p>

<p>College basketball player Matt Farrell was overcome with emotion when the soldier brother he thought was serving in Afghanistan paid him a surprise on-court visit.</p>
<p>The Notre Dame junior point guard was speaking with his older sibling Bo Farrell on the big screen via what he believed was a video link after Monday’s game versus Colgate at the Edmund P. Joyce Center arena. His brother had been due to return to the U.S. in February.</p>
<p>But Bo Farrell was actually elsewhere inside the arena. On finishing his message, he walked onto the court and shared a teary embrace with his stunned sportsman brother.</p>
<p>”I didn’t know he was here,” Matt Farrell told the Indianapolis Star after the reunion, following a 77-62 Notre Dame victory in which he scored 13 points.</p>
<p>“We don’t ask much for Christmas, anyway,” added Farrell, from Bridgewater in New Jersey. “So this is the best Christmas present I’ve ever had.”</p>

<p>“One way to determine what is missing in day-to-day American life may be to examine what behaviors spontaneously arise when that life is disrupted.” - Sebastian Junger</p>
<p>Detroit. Outside of Jack White’s storefront and studio, Third Man Records. There are twenty or so, all wearing red, mostly men. The group collects in the shade, arranging any which way to avoid the sun. Though there are rumors flying about, Jack White will not make a cameo today. With all that red out front, to the onlooker, the Detroiter, it may appear otherwise - a reprise to when White was candy striping, honoring the blues up and down Cass Corridor.</p>
<p>They are supporters of FC United of Manchester. Once labeled traitors, dismissed as a gimmick and called, “self publicists” by legendary Manchester United coach, Sir Alex Ferguson. In 2005, the small faction did the unthinkable; they walked away from Premier League powerhouse, Manchester United. It had been the only club they’d supported. The tipping point for many was the day Malcolm Glazer purchased majority shares in Manchester United. Others pointed to the removal of “Football Club” from Manchester United’s crest. The feeling for many was that the time had come to re-create a club representative of the Mancunian spirit. Owned by them.</p>
<p>It is May 2016, and Detroit City FC of the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL) is hosting FC United of Manchester, members of the National League North - sixth tier of the English Football pyramid - in an international friendly celebrating the supporter movement. Supporters from both sides calling it, “The Derby of the People!”</p>
<p>“To understand humanity through football.” I say, sequestering Roy Williamson, one of the traveling supporter’s of FC United.</p>
<p>“Oh really?” He chuckles when I tell him such. </p>
<p>Roy takes a sip from his beer. We’ve stepped into a bar blocks from Third Man Records. I’m waiting for him to explain how it feels to be a supporter-owner of a football club now in it’s 11th year of existence.</p>
<p>“After being at Manchester United,” Roy gives thought. “And to not be asked my opinion about anything basically. And then going to a club straight away, where I’m seen as important, and we’re seen as important. Where we can make decisions that will affect the future of the club, that was, politically for me, that was a massive move. I believe that people should be involved in their own futures, should be making decisions, and it’s allowed me to do that.”</p>
<p>I wondered if a time ever existed when Manchester United asked for real opinions from its supporters? And if so, were they valued? </p>
<p>Reports of infighting over the direction of FC United have become part of the club’s story over the past year. Focal to their evolution, disagreements over whether the non-profit club has strayed from its guiding principles; avoiding outright commercialism, attempting to make admission prices as affordable as possible, discriminating against none. In spite of any desultory rhetoric that’s cropped up, Roy still believes in the collective efforts of FC United members. He points to the community share scheme that FC United supporters collaborated on together. Enabling the club to build their very own ground in 2015, Broadhurst Park. </p>
<p>“The model that we’ve got,” says Roy, “compared to the normal Premier League, professional football setup. It’s one that, I’m never going to abandon this. I’m not going back. I might go back to see the odd game [Manchester United]. But I’m not going back as a supporter. Because what we’ve got is more important. Politically it’s more important.”</p>
<p>Roy was right. The supporter-owned movement is important. And it is political. And not just in England, or the United States. The movement has attracted a diverse group of individuals from various backgrounds, from multiple countries. Those seeking something more bespoke, something representative of one’s zip code. Where contribution to one’s club is experienced neighborly, and the direct impact of that effort, whether monetary or sweat equity - typically both - are crucial to the existence of the club. </p>
<p>“It’s also about making sure that football remains affordable.” Roy adds. “Too many are becoming disenfranchised from watching the sport live. And we don’t want that.”</p>
<p>Another reason I went to Detroit was to pay homage to the first community investment campaign in American sports history. Approximately 500 Detroit City FC supporters raised upwards of $725,000 through a crowd funding investment scheme - Michigan Invests Locally Exemption (MILE). The campaign covered the renovation costs allowing the semi-professional team the opportunity to relocate to the Hamtramck community, to Keyworth Stadium. An early Work Projects Administration (WPA) project, Keyworth opened in 1936, during a period in Detroit history when sit down strikes at General Motors were on going. </p>
<p>Completely surrounded by Detroit, the city of Hamtramck has become accustom to periods of change. So too immigrant influx. Polish immigrants initially moved into the area after the Dodge Brothers opened an automotive plant in 1914. Yemeni and Bangladeshi immigrants have since moved into the area, making Hamtramck the first Muslim-majority American city.</p>
<p>On the flight to Detroit, I started thumbing through Sebastian Junger’s latest book, Tribe. As I read, I considered what constituted tribal behavior. There were some at a local football pub I frequented who feigned a tribal feeling when describing a connection to their football club. Often, the football club they spoke of was accustomed to playing midweek UEFA Champions League games. In his book, Tribe, Junger writes, “Communities that have been devastated by natural or man-made disasters almost never lapse into chaos and disorder; if anything they become more just, more egalitarian, and more deliberately fair to individuals.” Moreover, “Acting in a tribal way simply means being willing to make a substantiative sacrifice for your community - be that your neighborhood, your workplace, or your entire country.” </p>
<p>As modern society has evolved, I wondered whether the meaning of the word tribe had been watered down? Become nebulous. Especially to football culture. Truthfully, of those at the pub who claimed or felt a tribal connection to their football club, how many had actually made some type of substantive sacrifice? Then I wondered, if it was possible, if one could make a genuine contribution to their club, would said club’s hierarchy or model even desire such a sacrifice? </p>
<p>In their first year of existence, FC United of Manchester supporters raised funds in support of the Bhopal Medical Appeal. Since 1996 the non-governmental medical initiative has provided free medical care to survivors of the Union Carbide pesticide plant gas leak, which exposed over 500,000 people to a symphony of chemicals. The industrial disaster, which has been considered the Worlds worst, occurred in 1984. Government officials of Madhya Pradesh, India confirmed nearly 3,800 deaths related to the gas exposure.</p>
<p>Would a Premier League club laud an ethical effort like this? </p>
<p>Roy and likeminded supporters felt like they had to sell off their shares in Manchester United after Malcolm Glazer’s takeover. “Here’s a rich man who’s bought my football team,” Roy’s financial investment had been relatively small. 50 quid. “But he wants me to continue to put the money into it, to make him even richer. It was akin to me, to someone pinchin’ your car. And you continuing to put the petrol in it. I wasn’t gonna do that.”</p>
<p>The night before in Corktown. Outside one of Detroit’s older establishments, Nancy Whiskey. I momentarily forget I’m in Detroit. It’s quiet. The air is surprisingly sweet. Leading away from the pub there are empty houses, or in some cases, those that wear the facade of abandonment. As I walk the neighborhood, the occasional vacant plot appears. It’s an odd scene. </p>
<p>Prior to Detroit becoming the largest municipality in U.S. history to enter Chapter 9 bankruptcy, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Rhodes summarized in his 2013 ruling, “We have here a judicial finding that this once proud city cannot pay its debts. At the same time, it has an opportunity for a fresh start. I hope that everybody associated with the city will recognize that opportunity.” </p>
<p>Soon both teams will join their supporters for a social hour at Nancy’s. The atmosphere will build. Hugs will be exchanged. It was unlikely that any of the socialites would have Judge Rhodes’s words at the forefront of their minds. About a fresh start. And recognizing opportunity. Yet those who espoused the supporter-built movement in Detroit were living proof. </p>
<p>After orienting myself with the room, I bump into Detroit City FC supporter Joe Novak. Standing there, he appeared to be absorbing the moment. Or the profundity of it. After sharing that I flew out from Denver for the match he was immediately delightful. </p>
<p>I ask Joe about grassroots football, “Why is the supporter-built model so important to Detroit?” </p>
<p>“Well Detroit, we were kinda left on our own. The big three can go bankrupt, or whatever.” Joe shakes his head. “Right next to us,” He points past a wall. “There’s literally across the street, there’s a burned out house.” </p>
<p>“Saw that.” I mumble. </p>
<p>With Junger’s definition of tribal behavior in mind, I wondered if Detroit City FC’s endemic support was a type of behavioral response to the socio-economic disasters of bankruptcy and bailout? Community members regaining equilibrium through a local football club. </p>
<p>“We’ve had to build this shit by ourselves, from the ground up.” Joe says with an almost stunned look. Like he’s tapped into a place where language tapers off. “So the ethos of this club is the same way.” </p>
<p>Joe manages the game day operations for the supporters group, the Northern Guard. He and other Northern Guard supporters had been at the airport earlier in the day, shuttling FC United supporters to their hotel. “You don’t need to wait for these millionaires to swoop in and create something for you.” His tone has changed to certainty. “You can create something yourself and be successful. That’s what I think Detroit City is all about. And that’s what I think FC United is all about.”</p>
<p>Being that Hamtramck wasn’t a well-off community, Joe shared how he and his father built a bin for soccer balls and placed it at Keyworth Stadium. Meanwhile, the Northern Guard solicited local businesses, garnishing the bin with soccer balls.</p>
<p>“Any kid in the community can come and take a soccer ball, play with it, put it back, and then the next kid can play with it.” Joe says, “It’s something small, but we do a lot of stuff like that. And that builds the sense that, you’re more than just a fan of a soccer club. You’re a member of a team, a family, a community.”</p>
<p>This aspect of things might seem Pollyanna, but the creation of something with the intention of sharing serves as an important reminder to the supporter-owned and supporter-built movement. Not only does it highlight the creation of a community asset, it features just how important individual efforts are to the inspiration of others. </p>
<p>Detroit City FC co-owner, Sean Mann shared with Stefan Szymanski, author of Soccernomics, one week before the international friendly, “We founded the club because we were dissatisfied with the version of capitalism that operates in modern sports in general, not just soccer. High ticket prices and stale atmospheres inside the stadium seem typical nowadays. Detroit City has found a niche by offering affordable prices and encouraging the fans to express themselves. The owners do not see the fans as customers but as the lifeblood of the club.”</p>
<p>Later at Nancy’s I meet up with Sean Grogan and Dean Simmer, both are Detroit City FC supporters. Both are equally enthusiastic about the football culture developing in and around Keyworth Stadium. </p>
<p>“You show up there during a night. It’s like 80 to 100 kids playing pick up out there,” Says Sean, who’s wholly unaware of the discussion Joe Novak and I had earlier in the night about Keyworth. “It’s incredible, on the same field that DCFC is playing on right now. That’s something I’ve never experienced out in the suburbs. That’s a real soccer culture to me.”</p>
<p>Neither Sean nor Dean will make use of the words tribe or tribal during our discussion, though I wouldn’t have been surprised if they had. Instead they make several references to culture. That the supporter-owned and supporter-built sporting cultures, had more to do about the people within the group and what they valued. </p>
<p>Dean, who’s one of the Capo’s for the Northern Guard, asks if I’m going to the game.</p>
<p>“Of course!” I say. </p>
<p>“Do the march with us,” he says, reminiscing about their recent supporters march. It had been the first one to Keyworth Stadium. “We march right through this neighborhood. There were probably 75 or more kids, families, all standing on their porches chanting, waiving and stuff as we went by. People who had never experienced it before were dumbfounded. Kids were slowly riding down the march on their bikes.” </p>
<p>As I found, the march started at Fowling Warehouse, mere blocks from the stadium. Supporters stake their claim of the residential streets, Conant and Jacobs, until they reach Keyworth. It’s a sight of passion. Smoke bombs and chants. Hand crafted flags. All of it reminding me of the march I had experienced in Seattle, a truly magnificent scene. Yet the march in Detroit felt different somehow. Almost pastoral, maybe. Everyone that was there, participating in the march, they could relate to each other in an industrious way. And then, for those standing on their front porch - dumbfounded - what else might they be feeling? Pride? A sense of connection? </p>
<p>Needless to say, I certainly hadn’t expected the march to resonate like that. “What an experience!” I remember saying to friends nearby as we marched in step. </p>
<p>Days later after returning home I felt this aha moment, something I experienced while looking out at Keyworth Stadium for the first time. I was reminded of the late Holocaust survivor, Viktor Frankl, who theorized that there were three core values to human life. After rereading some of Frankl’s work on values and meaning, I started to conceive the Detroit City FC and FC United supporter movement in a different way. The first core value Frankl identified was the creative, or that in which we create. Such as a work or a deed. The second core value was the experiential, or the way in which we experience something or encounter someone, whether it’s a chance encounter or the hundredth. And lastly, the most important value according to Frankl, the attitudinal. Regardless of any potential disaster or unwelcome situation we may experience in our lives, ultimately the attitude we choose in the face of adversity is paramount.</p>
<p>Unknowingly Dean embodied this sentiment, when he said, “For people who go to a Detroit City match for their first time, they don’t walk away saying, that was the best soccer game I have ever witnessed in person. They say stuff about the experience. And I think that’s the measure. People go there because they believe in the club. They believe in the experience. They believe in its investment in their community. And I think that’s the thing that makes Detroit City so radically different from, insert generic sports brand here.”</p>
<p>In stoppage time, FC United hold a narrow lead over Detroit City, 3 - 2. The match had gone back and forth, with Detroit City holding the lead for a good portion of the match. Then in the 93rd minute, Detroit City FC’s Alec Lasinski accomplished what most were hoping for, beating an outstretched FC United keeper, sending most of the 6,245 who attended into a frenzy. The game ending 3-3. </p>
<p>Joe Novak had said that the score of the game wasn’t important. And for the most part I believed him. Until that moment happened. Eight year veteran of Manchester United (1975 - 1983, accumulating 322 appearances for the club) Steve Coppell, joined the Detroit City FC commentating team for the match. Near the end of the live stream broadcast, as the players were shaking hands with the Northern Guard, Steve shared a few thoughts; “A draw was probably the right result. It could have gone either way. But in the spirit of the game, and the way it was destined to be, a draw keeps everybody happy. The FC United team can be so pleased with their contribution to this occasion.” Coppell then pauses briefly during the broadcast, “It wasn’t just a match, it was an occasion.”</p>
<p>I think everyone could agree with Steve. It had been an experience.</p>
<p>After the match, while gathering player interviews on the pitch, I see Roy shuffling towards the exit. We wave, exchanging pleasantries. A thumbs up. The day prior I had asked Roy if there was anything that the supporter movement had taught him. I could almost hear him again as he found his way to the exit.</p>
<p>“I think what this last year has taught me, is that you evolve because of the new members. And you’re gonna hit times when it becomes more difficult. And we will get through these issues at the moment. But they might come back in another ten years. So what it’s taught me is that it isn’t something you set up and it goes on forever. You continually have to make sure that you’re doing things right. And that includes educating people who are coming along to watch FC United.”</p>

<p>A Cleveland weatherman has gone full “Cast Away” thanks to his refusal to shave until the hapless Browns win a football game. </p>
<p>Fox 8 Cleveland meteorologist Scott Sabol probably didn’t expect the Browns to be this bad when he made the regrettable promise earlier on in the season. Now he’s sporting one woolly beard.</p>
<p>Oh, yes. The Browns are 0–12. </p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look at the evolution of the beard, shall we?</p>
<p>Sabol looks sharp and clean-shaven in his default image on Twitter. Very professional. Would make a great meteorologist.</p>
<p>Now, here’s the beard in early October. You can tell that Sabol is starting to think about the off-season. </p>
<p>Late October. Perhaps Sabol should have made his wager on the Cleveland Cavaliers winning a game.</p>
<p>By the end of November, Sabol has become a lumberjack.</p>
<p>As you may have noted from the tweet above, Sabol has made clear that he will shave at the end of the season, should the Browns fail to win before then. That’s probably for the best.</p>

<p>Gregg Popovich has been on something of a tear ever since Donald Trump was elected president last month.</p>
<p>Just days after Nov. 8, the San Antonio Spurs head coach said he couldn’t “imagine being a Muslim right now, or a woman, or an African-American, a hispanic, a handicapped person.” A few days after that, he said it was “disorienting” to realize that “certain values that [he thought] were held in esteem” actually “aren’t very important to half the country.”</p>
<p>On Sunday in San Antonio, Popovich had some more things to say about the state of the U.S. But this time, his words weren’t directed at the country more generally, but at his own players and the high school students they inspire. </p>
<p>Popovich was speaking at the Carver Community Center in San Antonio. In the crowd was an audience made up of 250 students from a local high school, as well as many members of the local community and the Spurs organization, players included. Onstage with him was Harvard professor Cornel West and discussion moderator Dave Zirin of The Nation. </p>
<p>Popovich and West took turns at the event taking questions from students in the crowd, but from them all, Popovich’s answer to one child’s question in particular stood out: Are the Spurs going to win the championship? </p>
<p>“Win the championship? I don’t know, but it’s not a priority in my life,” Popovich said. “I’d be much happier if I knew that my players were going to make society better, who had good families and who took care of the people around them. I’d get more satisfaction out of that than a title.”</p>
<p>Popovich then added, “I would love to win another championship, and we’ll work our butts off to try and do that. But we have to want more than success in our jobs. That’s why we’re here. We’re here so you’ll understand that you can overcome obstacles by being prepared and if you educate the hell out of yourself. If you become respectful, disciplined people in this world, you can fight anything. If you join with each other and you believe in yourself and each other, that’s what matters. That’s what we want to relay to you all: that we believe that about you or we wouldn’t be here.”</p>
<p>No one with any understanding of the NBA would ever doubt Popovich’s passion for the game of basketball. He is the gold standard among modern NBA coaches, owner of five championships and nineteen straight winning seasons.</p>
<p>But that he is so willing to say he would prefer his players be good people first and foremost says something even more about Popovich than any of his accolades. It says he is a good person, too. </p>

<p>Heisman Trophy-winning football player Rashaan Salaam, 42, was found dead in Boulder, Colorado, on Monday night.</p>
<p>Salaam’s body was discovered in Eben G. Fine Park in Boulder, according to a statement from the Boulder County Coroner’s Office. </p>
<p>An investigation into Salaam’s death is underway, the Boulder County Police Department told The Huffington Post, but there is no indication of foul play or a threat to the community.</p>
<p>Salaam, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1994, was a star running back at the University of Colorado in the ‘90s. He was inducted into the school’s Athletic Hall of Fame in 2012. After college, Salaam played in the NFL for the Chicago Bears for three seasons.</p>
<p>“The Buff Family has lost an outstanding young man and a great Buff today,” Rick George, the athletic director at the University of Colorado, said in a statement. “We are heartbroken for Rashaan and his family and our thoughts and prayers are with them at this very difficult time.”</p>
<p>Salaam most recently lived in Superior, Colorado.</p>

<p>NEW YORK ― Life is different now for Von Miller. That tends to happen when your team wins the Super Bowl and you, personally, are named MVP. Or maybe it just happens when you’re one of the most dominant defensive players of a generation.</p>
<p>But even if life is different, Miller ― who diligently eats Chefs Cut Turkey and consumes cage-free eggs ― himself is still the same.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t changed me or who I am,” Miller recently told The Huffington Post. Then again, it’s not like Miller’s success just came overnight.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old Denver Broncos superstar was the second pick in the 2011 NFL Draft after winning the Butkus Award at Texas A&M as college football’s best linebacker. In July, following his standout performance in the Super Bowl, Miller signed a six-year extension worth $114.5 million, including $70 million guaranteed with the Broncos. The contract made him the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history, and got him the highest guaranteed salary of any defensive player in the league.</p>
<p>As an encore, Miller has arguably been even more dominant in 2016. His 12.5 sacks through 11 games lead the league, and his 22 quarterback hurries are tied for fourth most. Perhaps more impressively, he has actually been more effective against the run than the pass, according to Pro Football Focus’ advanced metrics. And he’s doing all of this amid constant double- and even triple-teams.</p>
<p>During Denver’s bye week, The Huffington Post caught up with Miller in New York City to discuss a number of topics, including being bullied as a child, politics in the locker room and the best advice he’s gotten during the last year. It was as enlightening a chat as you’d expect with a guy who’s so gracious, he sends wine to his opponents.</p>
<p>This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p>
<p>You weren’t in particularly good shape to begin your collegiate career. When did nutrition become a priority for you? </p>
<p>In the National Football League, everyone is talented, so it’s the small stuff that really separates you from the next guy. How hard you train, are you training harder? Are you sleeping more, are you getting more rest? Are you eating better? Those are the areas where you can separate yourself ― legally, there are all types of ways that are legal, natural. </p>
<p>We have learned about the value of quality sleep. What type of emphasis do you put on it, and have you ever used the hyperbaric chamber?</p>
<p>I do have a hyperbaric chamber, but old-fashioned, high-quality sleep ― you can’t really account for it. Naps are always good, but you can’t really account for it. Deep sleep is best. I don’t know how many hours. We’re humans and we’re not the most consistent animals in the world, so it’s hard to string together nine hours of sleep every day. Sometimes it might be seven, sometimes it might be six, but sleep is just as important as nutrition.</p>
<p>You were bullied as a child for being a nerd and for wearing glasses. You now host an annual vision day to serve children and make sure they are receiving proper care. How does your upbringing affect the message you hope to instill to today’s youth?</p>
<p>I mean, when has it ever been when being smart isn’t cool? I just like to know my facts, and I like to fact-check. It’s not really too tough ― if somebody tells me something, I’m gonna go check it. If I see something that’s interesting, a fact, I’m gonna hold on to it and I’m gonna regurgitate that when I’m around my friends or whenever the time is needed to let that information out there.</p>
<p>I think really expressing yourself, especially mentally, is very, very important. Especially in our day and age, when everything is so cookie-cutter and everything is the same. Especially in the National Football League, it’s really hard to separate yourself from the next guy, and the way to do that is to be yourself, be 100 percent yourself. There’s only one Von. So if I’m me, I’m separating myself from the next guy, and that includes being studious with the facts.</p>
<p>Seahawks star defensive end Michael Bennett, a friend of yours, has told me how challenging it is to be an individual ― to be original ― in the NFL. Why is it so important for you?</p>
<p>It was extremely important for me to be myself [when I first entered the league]. Like Mike said, it’s not an original league. They hate when there’s some guy who stands out... So how I battled that is, I’m just versatile. It doesn’t matter if I have to wear glasses or listen to country music or listen to rap music or go here or go there. Whatever it is, I’m putting 100 percent Von Miller into that, and that’s how I separate myself. [Football] is just a game.</p>
<p>With the election and the current state of America, do politics play a prominent role in the locker room?</p>
<p>Guys always talk politics. Guys always talk about a wide array of stuff. In every locker room, you feel like there’s guys who feel like they’re the experts when they’re really not. The locker room is a different reality, it’s a different place. Being right in the locker room doesn’t mean you’re right in real life or in the real world. It’s just an interesting, neat environment that we have in the National Football League. </p>
<p>What is the best piece of advice you’ve received during the past year?</p>
<p>Somebody told me: “You can’t live double lives, especially when you’re a star... Just don’t live double lives, so you are who you are on the football field and you’re exactly the same way off the football field.”</p>
<p>Check out my recent appearance on NFL Network’s “Good Morning Football,” where I chat about Miller, Matthew Stafford, the Atlanta Falcons and the Legion of Bark.</p>

<p>You might get a kick out of this NFL punter.</p>
<p>When the Buffalo Bills’ Corey White ran into Marquette King of the Oakland Raiders on Sunday, a penalty flag was throw against him ― and King did a little dance with it. </p>
<p>His legs cut out from under him, King got to his feet to do sort of a hand jive number.</p>
<p>The punter was penalized for the celebration but the Raiders had retained possession on the initial roughing call and were able to preserve a 38-24 victory in Oakland.</p>
<p>King, one of the league’s more entertaining players, went on Twitter to hilariously call out a possible tattletale. </p>
<p>     The so-called No Fun League, which has already crushed twerking and other gestures of joy, wasn’t going to spoil King’s day.        </p>

<p>When the NFL told players this season that they could dedicate a piece of their uniforms to a cause or charity they wanted to highlight, Bilal Powell knew right away what he wanted to do.</p>
<p>So on Monday night, the soft-spoken New York Jets running back plans to use his cleats to send a loud message to the world: It’s time to put an end to the gun violence plaguing American communities. </p>
<p>Gun violence is an issue that hits close to home for Powell, whether that’s in his native Lakeland, Florida; in Louisville, Kentucky, where he went to college and still has a home; or in New Jersey, where he lives during the NFL season. </p>
<p>“I lost a lot of friends and a family member to gun violence,” Powell told The Huffington Post by phone Saturday. “My best friend lost a bunch of family members to gun violence in the city of Louisville, and it’s pretty bad up here in New Jersey too. ... You just want to do something about it.”</p>
<p>The NFL has long fined players, like Powell’s teammate Brandon Marshall, for using their cleats as a billboard for issues that aren’t league-sanctioned. But after years of criticism, it announced earlier this year that it would relax the policy for Week 13 of the 2016 season. As it happens, the Jets will play the Indianapolis Colts during Monday Night Football, giving Powell’s message against gun violence a national audience. </p>
<p>“It being a Monday night game, it was a chance to bring awareness,” he said. “We have to see what we can do to, one day, get everybody at peace and live together.”</p>
<p>Once he landed on gun violence prevention as the issue he wanted to highlight, Powell still had to figure out the best way to do it. For that, he turned to Scedric Moss, his former University of Louisville teammate who is now an artist based in the city. Moss was busy with his own projects. But he had also lost friends to gun violence, and he couldn’t pass up the opportunity to design Powell’s cleats.</p>
<p>Moss went to work, fast. The result was a pair of tricolor cleats that will be impossible to miss under the stadium’s bright lights. Each of the three colors Moss selected ― green, neon yellow and red ― symbolizes gun violence. The green, Powell said, stands for money, often a source of conflict that leads to fatal gun disputes. The yellow is for police caution tape. And the red speckles represent the blood shed in each of America’s thousands of annual gun deaths.</p>
<p>“He lost friends and family to the same thing, so it meant that much more to him to be a part of this,” Powell said of choosing Moss to design the shoes. “It was good timing and the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>On the side of each shoe, Moss also painted the outlines of two raised hands. They represent the charity Hands Across Louisville, an anti-gun violence organization in Powell’s adopted hometown. The shoes will go to auction after the game, and the proceeds will be put toward the group’s work to address the root causes of gun violence. Among other priorities, the organization wants to train local citizens in anger management and social interaction, and bolster job creation and career-training efforts, </p>
<p>Powell chose the Louisville charity because of the time he spent there in college. He was a standout running back for the Cardinals, amassing more than 2,600 total yards and 22 touchdowns during his four years at the university. To get there, he’d left behind a past that included, he said, a stint in a gang in Florida.</p>
<p>But even in in Kentucky, gun violence remained close to his life. During Powell’s sophomore year in 2008, Louisville wide receiver Trent Guy was injured in a shooting in the city. Two years later, another one of Powell’s teammates ― former Cardinals linebacker Daniel Covington ― was shot and killed in a dispute downtown.</p>
<p>The city where Powell now lives in the offseason and plans to retire once his career is over is still struggling with gun violence: a double homicide shooting in Louisville’s Shawnee Park on Thanksgiving Day made national news ― and pushed the city’s total number of homicides for the year to a five-decade high.</p>
<p>“The city of Louisville will always be in my heart,” Powell said. “You have people losing innocent lives in this. This hit home for me. I wanted to choose something that I had a connection to.”</p>
<p>And although he already had the cleats in the works, the issue of gun violence touched Powell’s life again this week. Former Jets running back Joe McKnight was shot and killed during an apparent traffic altercation outside of New Orleans on Thursday afternoon. Powell and McKnight were teammates for two years in New York, and the two had kept in touch, even though McKnight left the NFL and spent this past season in the Canadian Football League.</p>
<p>Powell’s call for an end to gun violence, then, will carry a particularly poignant and timely message Monday night. </p>
<p>“Joe was an amazing person. A great teammate, and an even better person,” Powell said. “That right there, it’s sad to say, that another person’s life is gone over something that probably could have been prevented. ... It puts a lot of things in perspective.”</p>
<p>The cleats aren’t Powell’s only form of action on gun violence. After he made it to the NFL, he started The Bilal Powell Foundation to help keep children out of trouble and away from the type of violence has has experienced up close too often. It’s geared toward expanding community and education opportunities for at-risk children in the cities he’s called home.</p>
<p>But for a running back who usually prefers to let his performance on the field speak for him, this week, and this pair of cleats, offers a chance to broadcast his message publicly in a way he hasn’t necessarily before. Powell is excited about that opportunity, so much so that he’s even planning to make his teammates wait to see the final product in person.</p>
<p>“Hopefully this is something that will wake a lot of people up,” Powell said. “What I’m trying to do Monday night is get people to open their eyes, man, and try to bring peace.” </p>

<p>Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr said he smoked marijuana to treat the pain as he recovered from two back operations and believes it may be a better option for professional athletes than some painkillers.</p>
<p>Kerr told CSN Bay Area on Friday that he experimented with the drug a “few times” to help him overcome the chronic back pain over the last two seasons.</p>
<p>“I guess maybe I can even get in some trouble for this, but I’ve actually tried it twice during the last year and a half, when I’ve been going through this chronic pain that I’ve been dealing with,” Kerr said on The Warriors Insider Podcast.</p>
<p>“A lot of research, a lot of advice from people, and I have no idea if maybe I would have failed a drug test. I don’t even know if I’m subject to a drug test or any laws from the NBA, but I tried it and it didn’t help it all.</p>
<p>“But it was worth it because I’m searching for answers on pain. I’ve tried painkillers and drugs of other kinds as well, and those have been worse. It’s tricky.”</p>
<p>Kerr, who underwent two surgeries on his back during the summer of 2015, said he still feels discomfort on occasion. He said he does not use the drug recreationally and no longer uses it for medical purposes.</p>
<p>But the 51-year-old Kerr told CSN that he would like to see the league and other organizations become more aware and accepting of medical marijuana use.</p>
<p>“I would hope so, and I’m not a pot person. It doesn’t agree with me,” Kerr said. “I’ve tried it a few times, and it did not agree with me at all. So I’m not the expert on this stuff.</p>
<p>“But I do know this: If you’re an NFL player, in particular, and you’ve got a lot of pain, I don’t think there is any question that pot is better for your body than Vicodin. And yet athletes everywhere are prescribed Vicodin like it’s Vitamin C...</p>
<p>“Vicodin is not good for you. It’s way worse for you than pot, especially if you’re looking for a painkiller and you’re talking about medicinal marijuana ... I think it’s only a matter of time before the NBA and NFL and Major League Baseball realize that.”</p>

<p>A man suspected of shooting and killing former National Football League player Joe McKnight in a possible case of road rage in a suburb of New Orleans was released from custody Friday without charge, police said.</p>
<p>The suspect, 54-year-old Ronald Gasser, was taken into custody after Thursday’s shooting around 3 p.m. local time in Terrytown. </p>
<p>McKnight, 28, was pronounced dead at the scene, suffering from “multiple gunshot wounds,” Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Department said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>McKnight played for the New York Jets and Kansas City Chiefs. After 2014, his last NFL season, he had played as a running back in the Canadian Football League.</p>
<p>Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said at a news conference on Friday that it was premature to draw conclusions about the shooting and that the investigation would continue.</p>
<p>The Jefferson Parish District Attorney declined to comment.</p>
<p>Normand said his office had been publicly criticized for releasing Gasser, who is white, in the shooting of McKnight, a black football player who had a five-year career in the NFL. </p>
<p>“I’ve been accused of dropping the ball and doing this and doing that because we released Gasser last evening,” Normand said. “We will leave no stone unturned.”</p>
<p>Normand added that “everybody wants to make this about race. This isn’t about race.”</p>
<p>The hashtag #JoeMcKnight was among the top-trending topics on Twitter in the United States as many social media users voiced shock and outrage.</p>
<p>“I don’t get it,” wrote Antonio Cromartie, McKnight’s teammate during his time with the Jets. “How in hell do you release someone who killed my brother.”</p>
<p>Rex Ryan, who coached McKnight for three seasons with the Jets, said in a written statement released by the Buffalo Bills, the team he now coaches, that the running back’s death was “heartbreaking.”</p>
<p>“He was always determined to get better - better as a football player and as a man - and I thought he did that.”</p>

<p>Major League Baseball and its players union tentatively reached an agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement Wednesday night, the league announced in a news release.</p>
<p>The new agreement would stretch for the next five years, extending baseball’s period of labor peace through the end of the 2021 season. Players and owners had until just before midnight Wednesday to reach a deal or agree to extend negotiations before the old agreement expired.</p>
<p>MLB owners and the MLB Players Association, under the leadership of former player and current Executive Director Tony Clark, are still working to finalize terms of the new bargaining agreement, which will be subject to a vote from players and owners once it is complete.</p>
<p>But that should now be a formality. According to reports, the framework of the new deal largely resembles the old one, after the most controversial and contentious issues died at the bargaining table. There won’t be, for instance, a new international draft for foreign-born prospects, as owners had wanted but players fought vehemently. Neither will the deal expand the size of regular season rosters.</p>
<p>Baseball’s negotiation process dragged on longer than many thought it would, given the sport’s financial health. Reports in recent weeks hinted at the possibility of a lockout if the two sides couldn’t reach a new deal.</p>
<p>But in the end, the two sides avoided a work stoppage for the fourth consecutive time since players launched what became a 232-day strike that stretched across the 1994 and 1995 seasons, and baseball’s unprecedented period of labor peace seems set to last for at least five more years.</p>

<p>When your dad is swimming’s GOAT, you have to trust him in the pool.</p>
<p>Boomer Phelps, the nearly 7-month-old son of Olympian Michael Phelps, did a fine job of that in a swim lesson with Pop and his childhood teacher, Cathy Bennett.</p>
<p>In a Facebook Live video from Baltimore on Monday, little Boomer spent some of the time tugging at his dad’s beard and looking adorable. But he got down to business when Bennett gently placed him underwater and handed him off to Phelps.</p>
<p>“The process is starting where he gets to become more water-safe and relaxed, comfortable in the water,” Phelps said.</p>

<p>Former NFL running back Joe McKnight was shot and killed on Thursday afternoon in an apparent road rage incident in Louisiana, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office has confirmed to The Huffington Post. </p>
<p>A source at the scene told The Times-Picayune that she saw McKnight apologizing to the visibly agitated assailant at an intersection in Terrytown, Louisiana. The assailant, who was yelling, shot McKnight, proceeded to stand over him and yell “I told you don’t you f**k with me,” then shot him again. </p>
<p>Police told HuffPost that the incident occurred at roughly 2:43 p.m. McKnight was identified at the scene.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old McKnight grew up in Louisiana, attending John Curtis Christian School before he went on to star at USC. In 2010, he was drafted in the fourth round of the NFL draft and went on to play four seasons of professional football — three for the New York Jets and one for the Kansas City Chiefs. He last played in the league in 2014. </p>
<p>Following the news of his death, those who knew McKnight expressed their shock on Twitter. </p>
<p>UPDATE ― Friday, 10:10 a.m.: Ronald Gasser, the man who authorities believe shot Joe McKnight, has been released without being charged, according to The Times-Picayune. The investigation is ongoing. </p>

<p>Tim Tebow says he’s $1 million poorer, thanks to New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick.</p>
<p>In his new book Shaken: Discovering Your True Identity in the Midst of Life’s Storms, the former NFL quarterback said he sought Belichick’s permission to accept $1 million for a one-day endorsement appearance. Tebow wrote that he asked because he wanted to fit in with the Patriots during the 2013 preseason.</p>
<p>“Timmy, I would really appreciate it if you didn’t,” Belichick responded, per Tebow’s book.</p>
<p>So Tebow turned down the deal and a short time later, the Patriots cut him.</p>

<p>LONDON (Reuters) - The English Football Association (FA) has launched an internal review to examine allegations of children being sexually abused at professional soccer clubs.</p>
<p>English soccer’s governing body said on Sunday that it had appointed Kate Gallafent QC as leading independent counsel to oversee its investigation after former soccer players told British media on Friday that they were sexually abused as children at English clubs.</p>
<p>British police are already investigating mounting accusations of pedophile activity in youth teams, which victims say has gone unreported for decades.</p>
<p>After accusations this month from former Crewe Alexandra player Andy Woodward, saying he was molested as a boy by talent spotter and convicted pedophile Barry Bennell, other former youth players have gone public with allegations.</p>
<p>Fourth-tier Crewe are looking into the allegations, while Premier League Manchester City are investigating whether Bennell had any association with the club. Bennell has made no public comment on the allegations.</p>
<p>The FA’s internal review will look into what information the association and clubs were aware of at the time of the alleged offenses and what action was or should have been taken.</p>
<p>Former Manchester City youth team player Jason Dunford was one of four former players who waived their anonymity to appear in a BBC television program on Friday to say they were abused by Bennell.</p>
<p>A statement from Manchester City on Thursday said: “The club is aware of allegations that Barry Bennell had an association with Manchester City Football Club in the 1980s. As a result, the club is currently undertaking a thorough investigation of any past links he might have had with the organization.”</p>
<p>Crewe issued a statement on Tuesday after Woodward’s allegations. “When things come out of the blue like this, you first want to make inquiries and reflect from within. That is the process we started last week,” the club said.</p>
<p>SAFETY PROCEDURES</p>
<p>The FA said last week that criminal record checks were required for all individuals working with children and more than 35,000 people went through an awareness workshop or tailored training every season.</p>
<p>On Sunday the FA said that the Child Protection in Sport Unit, which has assisted the association with its safeguarding procedures since 2000, will also carry out an independent audit of the FA’s current practices.</p>
<p>A statement from Cheshire police in northwest England said that allegations had been made against “more than one individual” in relation to past abuse of young footballers. London’s Metropolitan Police said on Friday that it had received information relating to “non-recent sexual abuse in soccer clubs in London”. Police in Hampshire also said they were investigating a case of child sex abuse within soccer.</p>
<p>Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA), said on Friday that the sport had to respond to the allegations. “The police need to be at the vanguard of investigations, because these are criminal acts, but soccer has a duty of care and must also grasp the nettle and take responsibility,” he said in a telephone interview with Reuters.</p>
<p>“What we don’t want is people thinking they couldn’t let their youngster go into soccer, when the positives can outweigh the negatives by so much.”</p>
<p>Bennell served three years in a U.S. prison for the sexual abuse of a 13-year-old British boy while on a soccer tour of Florida in 1994 and was jailed for nine years in Britain in 1998 after pleading guilty to 23 specimen charges of abuse.</p>
<p>In 2015 the same British court found Bennell guilty of four counts relating to the sexual abuse of boys.</p>
<p>The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said it received 50 calls within two hours of setting up a hotline on Thursday.</p>

<p>Are training parters good or bad? Well it depends on the circumstances.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When I began working out at the age of 16, I had no idea what a training partner was. I just went to the YMCA and started doing weight exercises that I saw in the magazine. I picked a few exercises that I thought looked interesting such as bench press, standing press, curls and tricep pushdowns. Even at that I began to make some progress as my body responded very well. I'd look around the gym at the 2 other members and see what they were doing and sometimes copy them.</p>
<p>It wasn't long before I asked for a spot on the bench press and then the other person would work in with me. Maybe that's where training partner came from?  I'm not sure but the inspiration did help.</p>
<p>I started incorporating other exercises and results popped up fast. Some one in the gym had me work in with them doing squats, deadlifts and bench presses and it did inspire me to enter a power lifting contest which I took second. In this case a training partner was good. AS you can see by the photos my body was developing nicely.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>When I left Bakersfield and moved to Los Angeles I began training at Bill Pearl's gym in Inglewood which was really a hard core gym. I trained alone at first then met some other guys that would work in on sets with me and we motivated each other to train harder.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I learned more from training with others but at time unless the person trains hard it slows down your tme in the gym and if they talk too much, then it really slows it down.</p>
<p>I moved on to Gold's Gym after about a year and met a whole new group of friends. It wasn't long that I began training with Arnold himself and learned even more. We had some great workouts together and my progress was even better by far.</p>
<p></p>
<p>These two pictures are only one year apart and you can see a huge difference just by training with Arnold. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Having the support of someone else who was serious really helped a lot. I also trained with Bill Grant but his hours would change on his job so it was difficult to be consistent however we did have good workouts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There were many times over the years I trained alone but I'm self motivating and have to problem training by myself and in fact I can go faster and not be held back. Many times I've had younger guys want to train with me and I actually made seven of them throw up on my routine.</p>
<p>As I get older I don't workout near as heavy and limit to 3 exercises per body part and seem to get good results. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Then on occasion I will train with Inna, my Girlfriend and we can have a good workout together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buy over all it's up to the person. If you want motivation and need a training partner to get through a work out, then by all means do it. If you are a self motivated person then you will be able to go faster through your workouts and really flush the muscle out. Try both and see what works for you. But for sure, keep training.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Barack Obama presented the prestigious Medal of Freedom to 21 remarkable men and women from around the country. The highest civilian honor our country has was bestowed on the likes of Diana Ross, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bruce Springsteen and Ellen DeGeneres.</p>
<p>Michael Jordan also received the Medal of Freedom on Tuesday. But unlike those that surround him, Jordan also has the honor and burden of being the basis of perhaps the internet’s single greatest internet meme. We speak, of course, of Michael Jordan Crying Face. </p>
<p>Obama referenced Jordan’s memedom during his speech about the Chicago Bulls legend, saying MJ was “more than just an internet meme,” a truth lost on many Americans below the age of 25. It was a soft joke, one that made Jordan lick his lips and chuckle, but then the internet, as it always does, caught on to something: Was Michael Jordan ... holding back tears?</p>
<p>Oh no. </p>
<p>Oh no, no, no. </p>

<p>Magnus Carlsen does not like to lose at chess. If he did, of course, he wouldn’t be the world champion; the best players are often the ones with the most pathologically intense aversion to losing. That, after all, is what motivates them day after day to put in the herculean mental effort required to play at the very highest level. This personality trait clashes rather jarringly with the bizarre tradition of the post-game press conference. At major events, the players are hauled out in front of the media mere minutes after each game and forced to endure questions from the public, often of an inane nature.</p>
<p>Some players gamely put on a happy face for the fans. Others opt for the Marshawn Lynch approach and rebel against the very idea that they have some obligation toward the media or the chess-watching public. Magnus Carlsen has always floated somewhere between these two extremes, but in this month’s championship match in New York, he’s tended increasingly toward the latter. After the first game he was subjected to multiple questions on the superficial relationship between the name of a chess opening variation and the name of the president-elect. After game 5 he responded to one question by saying simply, “I don’t care.” Other questions he has chosen to just ignore, leaving it to his challenger, Sergey Karjakin of Russia, to pick up the slack. And on Monday, Magnus took things to a whole new level.</p>
<p>The round started normally enough. Each game of the match thus far has featured a celebrity guest who is given the honor of playing the first move; today it was astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.</p>
<p>For a while it seemed that the eighth game, like the seven before it, would be ending peacefully. Sometime in the fifth hour that began to change. The realization dawned gradually on the live commentators that Magnus Carlsen was going to lose. For the first time in his life, he would be trailing in a world championship match.</p>
<p>That’s precisely what happened. And as the players headed out into the spectator’s hall for yet another press conference, Magnus’ patience was getting ready to fray.</p>
<p>In the video below, you’ll hear the official commentators discussing the result of the game. And at the end, you’ll see Carlsen snap and storm off the stage.</p>
<p>The champion did not return during the press conference; he left Karjakin alone on stage.</p>
<p> Brilliant photo by @photochess of the press conference with @SergeyKaryakin that Carlsen didn’t attend. #CarlsenKarjakin pic.twitter.com/1PhzvmBNv7 — Tarjei J. Svensen (@TarjeiJS) November 22, 2016</p>
<p>Carlsen has had difficulty with his temper in the past; here he is reacting to a few crucial losses in the world rapid and blitz championships last year:</p>
<p>But Monday’s display was his most surprising breach of decorum yet. It was the kind of petulance that should be beneath of a player of Magnus’ stature, but I’ll take a moment to sympathize with him.</p>
<p>I am not a grand master (although I did once win a 15-minute game against the Louisiana state champion) but I’ve played some long tournament games in my time. In one such game I gained an early advantage and soon found myself in a completely winning position. After a few hours of play, I was on the verge of wrapping up the game when I made a horrible error. No sooner had my hand left the piece than I realized what I’d done, but of course it was too late. It’s difficult to express the feeling of that moment, when hours (or in the case of the tournament I was playing in, weeks) of work are obliterated by a single, humiliating blunder.</p>
<p>The novelist H.G. Wells, himself an avid player, attempted to sum up this unique emotion in an essay entitled Concerning Chess. “There is no happiness in chess,” he wrote. “No chess-player sleeps well. After the painful strategy of the day one fights one’s battles over again. You see with more than daylight clearness that it was the Rook you should have moved, and not the Knight. No! it is impossible! No common sinner innocent of chess knows these lower deeps of remorse.”</p>
<p>Magnus will be experiencing those deeps tonight. He is adjusting to what is for him a new reality: he is losing a world championship match. The question is whether he can harness that emotion and redirect it productively in the next game - the first of only 4 remaining opportunities for the champion to level the score.</p>
<p>Game 9 begins on Wednesday, November 23rd at 2p.m. EST. You can find my previous coverage of the championship here, here, here, and here.</p>

<p>San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich drew national attention over the weekend after he took a reporter’s question about his thoughts on the election and delivered a passionate condemnation of President-elect Donald Trump.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, when asked about it again, his answer was less fiery, but just as eloquent. Popovich said that he had hoped Trump would come out with a message to try and assuage the fears of the minority groups he pointed to as the sources of America’s problems during his election campaign. Trump has done little to nothing in that regard, however, as Popovich noted. </p>
<p>“It’s still a disorienting situation, when you thought you lived in a certain kind of country with certain values that were held in esteem and find out those values aren’t very important to half the country,” Popovich said. </p>
<p>Rather than break up the quotes, we’re just going to let Popovich speak in his own words. Below is a transcript, via the Washington Post’s Tim Bontemps: </p>
<p> How did people react to what you said? I got a lot of email. Do you feel good about speaking up? I don’t know. Somebody asked me and I told the truth of what I felt, and I still feel the same way. It’s still a disorienting situation, when you thought you lived in a certain kind of country with certain values that were held in esteem and find out those values aren’t very important to half the country. I thought that with all the divisiveness in the election and all the groups President-elect Trump disparaged, the best way to start out would not be to worry about Obamacare or to talk about Wall Street or Medicare or anything, or make appointments, but to maybe say some things to assuage the feelings of all those groups he disparaged. But that didn’t happen. That was my hope. I thought that would be a great way to start if he was really interested in unifying and bringing everybody into the tent, so to speak. But that just got totally blown away, and everything he said ― there is no responsibility or accountability for it. So that still bothers me very much. Were you shocked at the way the election went? Sure. I think most people were. I think he was shocked. I think he was preparing to lose. You could tell because ... he doesn’t seem to be really that interested in policy or anything like that. I haven’t seen or heard from any core values or principles. He’s got one motivation and that’s to win at whatever he does. But that’s not a core value. That’s not a principle. That’s not a vision. I think it was pretty apparent that, at some point, when he thought he was going to lose, that’s when [he said] the system was rigged, just like in the primary. [That’s when he said] the reporter, the moderator asked more questions than him, the media this and that. [That’s when he said,] “I’m getting a raw deal.” But when he was winning, everything was fine. The same thing with the election. Now it’s not rigged, of course. What do you think of Steve Bannon being one of his top advisors? Well, I think that’s very troublesome to many of us. As I said, it would be great if he [Trump] made some statements to all of the groups he disparaged, to bring us all together, and to allay fears, because there are a lot of fearful people, and for good reason. But rather than doing that, he inflamed it even more with that appointment [of Bannon]. It’s kind of ironic. I wonder sometimes if he made all those statements, he certainly whipped up the fear-mongering and emotion in that base. But it’s going to be ironic because now a lot of the things he told them he’s going to do he’s already started to walk back a little bit. It’s sort of like, did he use them all to get elected, and thus [to win] again? He’s pretty good at that. You can’t believe anything that comes out of his mouth. It changes day to day, depending on the situation and what he needs at the moment. Would you potentially skip a future White House visit because he’s there? I’m not going to speculate on the future. I’m just talking about how I feel at the moment, and mostly for all of those groups that we all know.  The Holt family [which owns the Spurs] contributed a good chunk of money to Trump. They’ve obviously given you the green light to speak your mind?  No, they haven’t given me that freedom. I live in America. That’s what has given me that freedom. There are no individual people that give me that freedom. There are people who say about you ― saying this to “stick to sports.” Why is it important for you to speak out? I think everybody’s views are important. I think anybody who says that, it’s an easy argument. What we say might make them feel uncomfortable, so they have to come back with something. It’s basically sort of Trump-like. DO we want to go back to eighth grade, and do the cut-down artist thing? And go back and forth with someone if they disagree with me? But everybody can have an opinion. You can be the doctor, the plumber, the lawyer the car mechanic, the gardener or a lowly basketball coach. You can have an opinion. </p>

<p>One day after LeBron James criticized Knicks President Phil Jackson for using the term “posse” in an interview to describe James’ black friends and business associates, the Detroit Pistons head coach told reporters that there was a time when he also used the word.</p>
<p>“Have I ever used that word before with a white player?” Van Gundy asked himself on Wednesday before the Pistons took on the Knicks at Madison Square Garden.</p>
<p>“The answer is no,” Van Gundy said. “I think, look, you have to be aware of the language and you have to be aware a little bit of your own biases if you’re going to overcome them. I took that seriously.”</p>
<p>Van Gundy added that he understands “why it’s offensive” and stressed the importance of self-reflection.</p>
<p>“I’ve never used that word publicly with anybody but I have used it in just talking to people I know and things like that,” he said. “It has never been in conjunction with a white player. So I think at a time where you’re going to call out other people on attitudes you need to be willing to look in the mirror and call yourself out.”</p>
<p>Van Gundy also made headlines last week when he expressed his disgust with the election of Donald Trump, telling the Detroit Free Press that “I don’t think anybody can deny this guy is openly and brazenly racist and misogynist.”</p>
<p>New York Times contributor Mike Vorkunov shared a transcript of Van Gundy’s most recent statement.</p>

<p>Along with a World Series championship, its first in 108 years, the Chicago Cubs appear to have won a new fan: Pope Francis.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, roughly two weeks after the Cubs defeated the Cleveland Indians in Game 7 of the World Series, Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich tweeted a photo of him and Francis. In his hands, the pope holds a gift of a Cubs hat and autographed baseball. </p>
<p>“News of the Cubs win reached all the way to the Vatican!” Cupich wrote in his post about the gift. “Pontifex can now celebrate with us and he asks for our prayers! #FlytheW” </p>
<p>Whether Cubs fans can expect to see Francis at Wrigley Field next season is yet to be seen. Judging by the smile on his face, his holiness may well have been converted.</p>
<p>Cupich will return later this week to the Vatican, where he will be elevated to cardinal by Francis, archdiocese spokeswoman Colleen Tunney-Ryan told the Chicago Sun-Times. </p>
<p>It is unclear if Francis will opt for the Cubs hat instead of the zucchetto skullcap he usually favors. </p>

<p>When it comes to making a statement about President-elect Donald Trump, these NBA teams got game.</p>
<p>The Milwaukee Bucks, Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks will no longer stay at Trump-branded hotels in New York City and Chicago, ESPN reported. Another Eastern Conference team is under contract to stay at the Trump SoHo this season but will switch next year.</p>
<p>The moves are in part to “to avoid any implied association with the new president-elect,” ESPN wrote, citing unnamed sources.</p>
<p>The Grizzlies and Mavericks had previously stayed at the Trump SoHo in Manhattan and the Bucks used Chicago’s Trump International Tower and Hotel, the latter of which Trump’s company owns, the sports network said. </p>
<p>Both Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry backed Hillary Clinton in the election, Sports Illustrated noted.</p>
<p>Some NBA coaches such as the Golden State Warriors’ Steve Kerr and the Detroit Pistons’ Stan Van Gundy voiced their objections to Trump following his victory. </p>

<p>  New York’s Columbia University has suspended its men’s wrestling team as it investigates “racist, misogynistic and homophobic” text messages between team members, the New York Times reported on Monday. Harvard, another Ivy League university, canceled its men’s soccer season on Nov. 4 when officials found out that players had been making lewd rankings of women players for years. Columbia made its decision after BWOG, a student news website, published several text messages last week dating back to 2014 between teammates that contained jokes about rape and the use of homophobic, racist and sexist slurs and comments. The school’s athletic department “has decided that Columbia wrestlers will not compete until we have a full understanding of the facts on which to base the official response to this disturbing matter,” Columbia told the New York Times. The team withdrew from a meet on Sunday but practiced on Monday,Columbia said, according to the Times. It is scheduled to compete at the York State championships at Cornell on Sunday. School officials were not immediately available for comment. More than 900 people had signed an online petition by early on Tuesday calling for wrestling team members to be expelled and protests were held at the weekend outside the Kappa Delta Rho fraternity house, where wrestlers are members, the NYT said. In March, the university won the dismissal of a lawsuit by a graduate over the school’s decision to allow a student who accused him of rape to carry a mattress around campus in protest, even though Columbia had cleared him of the allegation.

<p>Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans refused to stand for the national anthem before his team’s 36–10 victory over the Chicago Bears on Sunday, instead choosing to sit on the sidelines in protest of President-elect Donald Trump. </p>
<p>“I’m not big on politics or things like that but I told myself I said if this happens, then America’s not right right now,” Evans said after the game. “When he ran, I thought it was a joke, and the joke continues.”</p>
<p>Numerous NFL players ― most prominently San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick ― have sat or taken a knee this year during the national anthem this year, but most have done so in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and in protest of the mistreatment of minorities in the U.S. </p>
<p>Evans, however, made clear after the game that his reason was his own.</p>
<p>“I’m doing it for a different reason, for how a reality star can be the president,” he said. “That’s not a good look for America.”</p>
<p>Some questioned Evans decision to protest the Sunday after Veterans Day, but Evans tried to make clear that he meant no “disrespect” to veterans. </p>
<p>“The men and women that serve this country, I’m forever indebted to them,” he said. “But the things that’s been going on in America lately, I’m not going to stand for that. When Ashton Kutcher comes out and says we’ve been Punk’d, then I’ll stand again. But I won’t stand anymore.”</p>
<p>In a statement, the Buccaneers said that the team encourages all of its members to stand during the national anthem, but respects players’ first-amendment rights not to do so if they wish. In Evans’ case, the protest will continue for as long as Trump holds office. </p>
<p>“It’s well documented what he’s done, and I’m not gonna stand for something I don’t believe in,” he said. “That’s the end of that.”</p>
<p>UPDATE ― Tuesday, 4:15 p.m.: Mike Evans apologized for his decision to protest in a statement released by the team on Tuesday. Here it is in its entirety:</p>
<p> I want to start by apologizing to all the U.S. military members, their families, and the fans who I offended by my actions on Sunday. It was never my intention as I have tremendous respect for the men and women who serve our country. I have very strong emotions regarding some of the many issues that exist in our society today. I chose to sit as an expression of my frustration towards this year’s election. It was very personal for me, as it was for so many Americans. With that being said, I will not sit again during the National Anthem because I want to focus my efforts on finding more effective ways to communicate my message and bring about change by supporting organizations and movements that fight for equal rights for minorities. This Sunday, I will be back to standing with my teammates.  </p>

<p>When Edin Dzeko of Bosnia and Herzegovina tumbled to the turf on Sunday, he pulled down the shorts of Greek player Sokratis Papastathopoulos.</p>
<p>Such a dignified move.</p>
<p>Dzeko was ejected and the game eventually finished in a 1-1 tie.</p>
<p>“I got a red card for no reason, I don’t know why,” Dzeko said, per ESPN FC. “The referee says I started the whole thing, but I was the only one ending on the floor, so how could I have started it?”</p>

<p>They tell a story about Norm Van Brocklin, the former Oregon University and NFL quarterback (a member of pro football's Hall of Fame) and later coach of the Minnesota Vikings and Atlanta Braves. Van Brocklin, who was nicknamed "the Dutchman," was known by friend and foe alike for being--how should we say this?--extremely blunt.</p>
<p>He also had little respect for sportswriters, whom he regarded as parasites. During later life Van Brocklin suffered from several serious health problems, including a brain tumor. He died from a heart attack at the age of 57. Following surgery on his brain tumor, Van Brocklin told people, "It was a brain transplant. They gave me a sportswriter's brain, to make sure I got one that hadn't been used."</p>
<p>During the time Van Brocklin coached the Falcons, he was the target of much media criticism, some of it intense and unfairly personal, and some of it, undeniably (with a Falcon record of 39-47-3), objective and deserved. After all, an NFL coach being criticized for a losing record comes with the territory. </p>
<p>After a game Van Brocklin was sitting in the hotel bar when a sports reporter--a writer who knew the Dutchman reasonably well and had always been on good terms with him--asked to join him. The coach was not in a particularly cheery mood (the Falcons had lost), but he invited him to sit.</p>
<p>Van Brocklin surprised the writer by making an observation: He said, "When you think about it, what the NFL does is really stupid. Football is a child's game. Kids play it in school. They play it in school, and then they move on to other things, more serious things. But even though it's a kid's game, we continue playing it. How stupid is that?"</p>
<p>The sports reporter wasn't sure where Van Brocklin was going with this until he reached across the table, grabbed the man by his tie, pulled his face next to his, and snarled, "But you wanna hear something that's even more stupid than guys like us playing a kid's game? Guys like YOU write about it." </p>
<p>When we examine the evolution of television sports shows, we see a fairly clear trajectory. It started off with sports being treated almost as an "after-thought," with a person or persons giving scores and game summaries. That was it. That was the extent of "sports coverage." Those were innocent days, fun days. Sports was America's playroom. </p>
<p>But over the years we've seen the rise of panel formats dripping with faux-locker room camaraderie--the ones that precede sporting events (think of the five braying jackasses who "discuss" football prior to NFL games on the Fox Network), where the panelists can't stop howling with scripted, unrestrained laughter. </p>
<p>And it's gotten worse. Not only have we seen sports coverage segue from an "after-thought" to a veritable laugh riot, but we've seen it further mutate into face-to-face conflict and controversy. Just as crime and violence get high ratings on the local news, conflict and controversy get high ratings on the sports shows. So that's what it's come to. A choice between scripted, make-believe post-adolescent frivolity or scripted, make-believe, incendiary conflict. </p>
<p>Which brings us to the Fox Sports Network's newest entry: "Skip and Shannon: Undisputed." It features loud, mindless, highly opinionated dialogue between ex-sports reporter Skip Bayless and ex-NFL player Shannon Sharpe, with the bright, attractive Joy Taylor wasted in the role of House Mother. The show is terrible.</p>

<p>Good news for Braves fans, but bad news for the Mets: Consistent pitcher Bartolo Colón has signed to the Atlanta baseball team, New York Daily News reports.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old, known to many as “Big Sexy,” signed a one-year free-agent deal with the Braves worth $12.5 million, pending a physical examination.</p>
<p>In a 2016 season where the Mets’ pitching staff was plagued with injuries, placing many of their young hotshots on the bench, Colón was a pillar of reliability and skill. This past season was only Colón’s third with the Mets, but he made a splash in the franchise, even hitting his first home run in a 19-season career during a game against the San Diego Padres, a “miracle” that could bring a tear to the eye of even the most hardened Mets naysayer.</p>
<p>Now that he will no longer be with the Mets, we’ll let pitcher Noah Syndergaard sum up New Yorkers’ feels: </p>

<p>It was a good run for Ryan Fitzpatrick while it lasted.</p>
<p>In 2015, the Harvard-educated quarterback and seventh-round draft choice wasn’t merely effective for the New York Jets ― he was really good. Fitzpatrick’s career-topping year included 31 touchdown passes (tied with Aaron Rodgers for 10th in the league) and nearly 4,000 yards passing while leading the Jets to a near-playoff berth under first-year head coach Todd Bowles. </p>
<p>However, for Fitzpatrick and Bowles, 2016 has been a completely different story. After holding out for much of training camp before inking a new contract, the 33-year-old Fitzpatrick has been nothing short of awful, and with no sign of improvement.</p>
<p>First came his six interceptions in a Week 3 loss to Kansas City. Then came three more the next week in a loss to Seattle and, later, a 174-yard effort during an embarrassing 28-3 Monday Night Football drubbing by Arizona.</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick, after being benched only to fill in for the injured Geno Smith and lead the Jets to a comeback win over Baltimore in Week 7, expressed his frustration with the organization: “When the owner stops believing in you and the GM stops believing in you and the coaches stop believing in you, sometimes all you have is yourself. That’s something I’ve had to deal with before, something I’m dealing with now.”</p>
<p>Whether Fitzpatrick was right about owner Woody Johnson is debatable. What is not debatable, though, is that with him under center the team has amassed a measly 3-6 record, well on its way to a sixth consecutive season missing the playoffs. Fitzpatrick’s 13 picks, meanwhile, are the most by a landslide, and he ranks dead last in both completion percentage and quarterback rating.</p>
<p>However, if there remains a silver lining to a string of losses, it’s that you can begin to take chances you otherwise wouldn’t consider if things were going well.</p>
<p>Bottom line: It would behoove the Jets to start exploring this concept, namely at the quarterback position. While the Geno Smith experiment has been a flat-out disaster since Day One ― he’s now injured for the remainder of the season ― we cannot say the same about Bryce Petty.</p>
<p>Petty, the team’s fourth-rounder in the 2015 draft, produced a highly prolific career at spread-happy Baylor in the Big 12, totaling a remarkable 62 touchdown passes and more than 8,000 yards in two years as a starter. At 6 feet 3 inches and 230 pounds, Petty possesses the trademark size and arm strength NFL general managers covet.</p>
<p>Of course, like the heavily maligned Jared Goff in Los Angeles, Petty worked solely out of the shotgun in college without the distinct responsibility of calling plays from the huddle.</p>
<p>Perhaps Petty is no more than a career backup at this level. Or, perhaps he is a hidden gem, who might just surprise us all. We will never know so long as the ineffective Fitzpatrick remains QB1.</p>
<p>Maybe Bowles ― who has repeatedly said Fitzpatrick gives his team the best chance to win ― has received pressure from his front office to play Fitzpatrick, considering that just this past July he inked a one-year, fully guaranteed $12 million deal. Or maybe Bowles believes the 25-year-old Petty simply is not ready to command the starting position. But isn’t it time to find out, one way or the other, if Petty is that guy? Or, at the very least, if he can become that guy?</p>
<p>At this point we know for certain what Fitzpatrick is ― and what Smith is for that matter. And neither is inspiring.</p>
<p>The Jets ― despite losing receiver Eric Decker for the rest of the year ― still have viable offensive weapons at their disposal in running back Matt Forte and six-time Pro Bowl wideout Brandon Marshall. In other words, the cupboard isn’t bare for Petty, and with seven games left, the franchise can find out whether it needs to get another quarterback in the offseason. Remember, too, that the league has never before seen such an influx of young quarterbacks yielding such positive results. This isn’t to say that Petty will be nearly flawless like Derek Carr in Oakland or accumulate numbers like the impressive Dak Prescott in Dallas, but who’s to say he won’t.</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick appears to understand just how inept he’s been too, particularly after tossing two more interceptions in Sunday’s 27-23 loss to Miami. </p>
<p>“As the quarterback and the guy that’s making a lot of the final decisions,” he said, “whether it’s to throw the ball or whether to run or check to the pass or vice versa, a lot of it falls on the quarterback.”</p>
<p>In the NFL at least, it always does. The “Fitzmagic” of 2015 is long gone. The Jets’ remaining schedule is brutal, with two tilts against New England left, along with games against quality defenses like the Rams and Bills. To be sure, nothing gets easier.</p>
<p>For Bowles, for this franchise and for its fans, the time has come to turn the page and start fresh with the younger and possibly more electric Petty. </p>

<p>The U.S. Men’s National Team on Friday will begin the final stage of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup with a match against Mexico, the United States’ most bitter international soccer rival.</p>
<p>The match comes just three days after the general election victory of Donald Trump, who labeled Mexican immigrants “criminals” and “rapists” when launching his presidential campaign and insisted repeatedly that he would build a wall along the southern border of the U.S. </p>
<p>Given that timing, American soccer’s governing body, top players and the team’s largest organized fan group are asking people in the U.S. to respect Mexico’s fans and players.</p>
<p>In a tweet featuring a quote from USMNT captain Michael Bradley, U.S. Soccer on Thursday called for fans to “respect the rivalry.”</p>
<p>“I would hope that our fans do what they always do, which is support our team in the best and most passionate way possible,” Bradley told reporters on Wednesday in Columbus, Ohio, where the match will take place. “I would hope that they give every person in that stadium the respect they deserve, whether they are Mexican, American, man, woman or child.”</p>
<p>“I hope that it is a special night in every way. U.S. vs. Mexico ― this is the biggest game that we play,” Bradley said.</p>
<p>The American Outlaws, the largest unofficial group of USMNT supporters, also tweeted a message to its members ahead of the match.</p>
<p>Trump’s statements about Mexico and Mexican immigrants played a role in the sports rivalry last October, when the two teams met in a final qualifier for the 2017 Confederations Cup.</p>
<p>Before the match, a Mexican TV station taunted the USMNT with an ad that cited Trump’s statements about the country, and his insistence that “the American dream is dead.” Fox, which broadcast the match in the United States, responded with its own Trump-themed ad, a promotion that didn’t go over well with many American soccer fans.</p>
<p>The match will mark the fifth consecutive World Cup qualifying cycle that the USMNT and Mexico have met in Columbus. The U.S has won each of the last four by the same 2-0 score.</p>

<p>Detroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy wasn’t in the mood to talk basketball ― not after Donald Trump had been elected president.</p>
<p>So Van Gundy sent diplomacy to the bench and spoke his mind.</p>
<p>“I don’t think anybody can deny this guy is openly and brazenly racist and misogynist,” Van Gundy told the Detroit Free Press Wednesday while the Pistons were in Phoenix for a game. “We have just thrown a good part of our population under the bus, and I have problems with thinking this is where we are as a country.”</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Van Gundy’s team plays in a state that voted for Trump by a narrow margin. That means he could potentially alienate about half of Michigan and a chunk of the team’s fan base by speaking his mind. Van Gundy has not been shy with his political beliefs before, openly opposing North Carolina’s anti-LGBTQ “bathroom bill” earlier this year.</p>
<p>On a day when New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said his wife had demanded that he stop talking politics, this public sports figure instead went all in.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how you go about it, if you’re a person of color today or a Latino. Because white society just said to you, again ― not like we haven’t forever ― but again, and emphatically, that I don’t think you deserve equality. We don’t think you deserve respect. And the same with women. That’s what we say today, as a country. We should be ashamed for what we stand for as the United States today.”</p>

<p>The next time you ask Tom Brady about politics, he’ll pass.</p>
<p>The New England Patriots quarterback revealed Wednesday he is under a gag order from his wife, model Gisele Bündchen, to discuss the presidential election or anything else in the political arena, outlets report.</p>
<p>Brady became part of the pre-Election Day hype earlier when Donald Trump declared Monday at a New Hampshire rally that he had the popular player’s support. But Bundchen had indicated on Instagram that the couple was not supporting the then Republican nominee.</p>
<p>“I talked to my wife, she says I can’t talk about politics any more. I think that’s a good decision, made for our family,” Brady told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Asked why he gave permission for the now-president elect to declare his endorsement, Brady said, “So you’re assuming I gave people permission.”</p>
<p>In a general thought on transition and presidential elections, Brady said that he’s always happy when people experience success. “I was happy when President [Bill] Clinton won. I was happy when Barack Obama won ― twice,” he said. “.It’s all competition.”</p>

<p>University of Wisconsin-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank apologized Monday for her school’s mishandling of a situation at an Oct. 29 football game against Nebraska in which two fans were not asked to leave after depicting Donald Trump hanging Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama with a noose.</p>
<p>The school, Blank added, is quickly moving to change the rules surrounding what people can carry into the stadium.</p>
<p>“I am personally very sorry for the hurt that this incident and our response to it has caused. I have heard from students, faculty and community members who are dissatisfied with our response, and I understand why,” Blank said. “A noose is a symbol of some of the worst forms of racial hatred and intimidation in our country’s history. We understand this and we should have communicated this more forcefully from the beginning.”</p>
<p>“I understand the deeply hurtful impact this has on our students and communities of color,” she continued. </p>
<p>Despite the language in the above tweet, the two fans were not actually asked to leave the game, simply to remove the noose from their masks. Both the school and the UW-Madison Police Department said at the time that the masks were a form of “free speech” and there was nothing they could do once the noose was removed. (The two fans reportedly put the noose back on later.)</p>
<p>The school’s position, however, appears to has shifted since then, following complaints by student-athletes including basketball star Nigel Hayes. In a tweet, Hayes said he was offended by the imagery the night of the incident, adding, “Is this what [Wisconsin] and [the Wisconsin Badgers] supports?”</p>
<p>In a separate tweet the next day, Hayes shared a photo of the school’s carry-in policy, which said items “must be of an appropriate nature.”</p>
<p>“Noose around neck of the image of our black president in a jail suit is appropriate?” he asked. </p>
<p>Chancellor Blank said Monday that Wisconsin has not only taken away the season tickets of the fans in question, but plans to quickly change the school’s carry-in and ticket policies before next Saturday’s game against Illinois.</p>
<p>“We will learn from this incident and do better next time,” she said. </p>
<p>Even after Blank’s comments, student-athletes including Hayes and 20 football players shared an open letter to the school on Monday in which they called attention to the difficulties that people of color face at the school and asked Blank to create “real programs” to improve their experience. </p>
<p>“It is painful that someone in our community would show up to an athletic event with a mask of our sitting president, who happens to look a lot like us, with a noose around his neck. That moment was like a punch in the face to not only student-athletes of color, but also current students, faculty, and alumni of color,” the letter reads. “This incident was yet another blow and reminder that there are people in this community that may not value diverse populations.”</p>
<p>Below you can read the full letter:</p>
<p> Many people believe that student-athletes of color are immune to the racial injustices that affect other students of color on campus. However, our experiences are not shielded by the ‘W’ we wear on our chest, our experiences are one in the same. We are loved during competition, but then subjected to racial discrimination in our everyday lives too. It is painful that someone in our community would show up to an athletic event with a mask of our sitting president, who happens to look a lot like us, with a noose around his neck. That moment was like a punch in the face to not only student-athletes of color, but also current students, faculty, and alumni of color. This incident was yet another blow and reminder that there are people in this community that may not value diverse populations. When we travel and play in other stadiums, fans have told us to get out of their country, or to go back to Africa, but it hurts to receive that treatment at home. It does not end at overt racial issues, but it is also seen through microaggressions. Aside from the incidents of racial slurs being flung at us, there are the assumptions that student-athletes of color wouldn’t have been admitted to this university on our merits alone. In actuality, we have to work twice as hard on top of our demanding schedules to prove to professors and classmates that we do belong here. We also have to deal with not being chosen for groups in classes because it’s assumed we are only here for sports and not to gain the knowledge and skills necessary for our future careers. We are fortunate to have many great professors here, but there are those that discourage us not to take their courses because they assume it’s too challenging. Also, fans don’t recognize the pain we feel when they voice their concerns about how raising academic standards will competitively disadvantage our teams, because they assume that student of colors can’t meet them. Socially, we shouldn’t be called loiterers and threatened to have the police called when we are simply waiting with friends for an Uber. Nor should we have to hear in the dorms, the classroom, or on the street, people refer to us as (expletive) or monkeys. People shouldn’t clutch their bags and cross the street as we approach them. We shouldn’t be commodified for mere entertainment, but respected as individuals with the ideas and the ability to contribute to society. These issues are in no way localized to UW, this is a national issue, and many universities across the nation need to start addressing how students of color are treated, and here at Wisconsin it starts at Bascom. Wisconsin can not only rely on statements, cultural competency emails and a few surveys to try and mediate this problem. We love the UW and are proud to be STUDENT-athletes here, and truthfully, our positive experiences outweigh the negatives, but no student should have to live through this negative climate. We ask that the university not continue to sweep the collective experiences of the students of color under a rug. So in solidarity with other students on this campus, we implore Chancellor Blank and her cabinet to take action, be visible and leave your ivory tower and speak to the students. Please create real programs, initiate meaningful change and understand that students of color deserve to thrive in this institution just like our peers. We want to be a part of the amazing legacy this university has held for years and years … On Wisconsin. </p>

<p>Radio host Rush Limbaugh, who once called law student Sandra Fluke a “slut” for speaking out in support of birth-control access, is now defending the Harvard men’s soccer team, Media Matters reported.</p>
<p>Last week, Harvard administrators canceled the rest of the team’s season after discovering players had kept an online scouting report that rated Harvard women players’ looks and assigned them a sexual position. The practice had been going on for years, the school determined.</p>
<p>Limbaugh chalked it up to boys-will-be-boys “human nature.”</p>
<p>“They cancelled the remainder of the male soccer season as a way of penalizing the men on the Harvard soccer team for daring to objectify women like this. ‘Who rates women on a scale of one to 10?’ they said. Hah, try everybody!”</p>
<p>“This kind of thing happens and largely it’s human nature,” he continued.</p>
<p>Limbaugh criticized reporters for supporting the administration’s actions, saying, “It’s a different era. We have to accept it.”</p>

<p>Former baseball star Curt Schilling is back in the news for yet another outrageous comment, this time tweeting about how “awesome” it is to lynch journalists. </p>
<p>On Monday, Schilling sent out this tweet showing someone at a Donald Trump event, which he has since deleted:</p>
<p>Schilling later defending his comment as “sarcasm” in a series of responses such as this one:</p>
<p>”Love those tolerant liberals! Just dying to find an offense somewhere other than their scumbag candidates,” he wrote in another response. </p>
<p>Schilling had a successful two-decade career as a pitcher that included being part of three World Series championship teams. However, his career off the field hasn’t been as smooth.</p>
<p>Over the summer, ESPN fired Schilling after he made a series of offensive comments on social media, including remarks comparing Muslims to Nazis and a rant against the transgender community. He has also been criticized over the failure of his video game company, which collapsed after accepting $75 million in loans that were backed by the taxpayers of Rhode Island. </p>
<p>More recently, Schilling announced he was going to run for the U.S. Senate in Massachusetts against Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren in 2018.</p>

<p>A super PAC backing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump unveiled a new ad this weekend that criticizes Hillary Clinton for opposing the name of Washington’s NFL franchise.</p>
<p>Clinton, in a 2014 interview, said the Washington team’s “Redskins” nickname was “insensitive.”</p>
<p>“I think that there’s no reason for it to continue as the name of a team in our nation’s capital,” Clinton said.</p>
<p>The ad rehashes the interview as evidence that Clinton is out of touch with football-watching voters.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you thought you were safe sitting in your recliner in your man cave, cold beer and a bowl of chips,” the ad’s narrator says. “Ha, you thought you’d escaped politics by focusing on football. Wrong. Hillary Clinton wants to mess up your football, too. Hillary wants to change the name of the Redskins.”</p>
<p>“Hillary’s priorities,” it concludes, “are not your priorities.”</p>
<p>Clinton was among the political leaders ― including President Barack Obama and at least 50 U.S. senators ― that called on Washington owner Daniel Snyder to change the controversial name. Many Native Americans have opposed the name for decades, with prominent Native American groups labeling it a “dictionary-defined racial slur.” </p>
<p>Trump, in contrast, has said he supports keeping the name. Watch the ad above.</p>
<p>Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.</p>

<p>While he may have been attempting a tricky onside kick Sunday, the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Chris Boswell looked an awful lot like a certain sandlot player from “Peanuts.”</p>
<p>The visiting Steelers were down 21-14 to the Baltimore Ravens with 48 seconds left. Boswell tried a sleight-of-foot maneuver called a “rabona.” It may have been the lamest onside kick attempt in history.</p>
<p>No we know Lucy wasn’t pulling the ball away at the last moment and Boswell wasn’t gaining a full head of steam to kick off and fall flat like Charlie Brown, but the result was pretty much the same.</p>

<p>The New York City Marathon is the largest, most popular marathon in the world! There’s no weekend in New York City more electric than marathon weekend. It’s big, it’s energetic, and completely soul lifting!</p>
<p>Can you tell I am a fan? Our entire family is. Our Uncle Arthur ran his first marathon in 1976. 1976 was the first year that the marathon was held outside of Central Park. 2,090 runners including Arthur Duffy made history that year! Arthur ran 5 NYC marathons and numerous others over his life time. He volunteered with the NY Road Runners Club during the years that he didn’t run. He inspired my husband to run in 2004 and we love looking at their stats on the official marathon website.</p>
<p>We were given the opportunity to attend the marathon eve dinner event in Central Park this evening. Even though we were not running I took my nine year old son as a tribute to Arthur who recently passed away. I was glad my son got to see the excitement first hand. He was very proud that both his great uncle and his father took part in the magic and I hope it inspires him to pick up the baton and run one day.</p>
<p>There are endless reasons to love the NYC marathon but I’d like to think these might be some that Arthur would agree with.</p>
<p> Marathon parties. If you are lucky enough to have a friend who lives along the race route treat them well all year in preparation. Nothing beats getting up early and brunching with your friends from an apartment overlooking the race route. Bagels, mimosas and friends cannot be beat! Depending on your fitness level lifting the cream cheese tub may be the most movement you will get all day.  The “I can’t leave the city today” excuse! Your family wants you to visit but its marathon Sunday! It is really the only day of the year you can claim to be held captive in the city and get away with it. All the roads are shut down and mass transportation is jam packed. Sorry I’ll have to stay local and be bored...(ha!)  Approximately 50,000 runners from around the world descend on NYC for the weekend. So many people from so many backgrounds coming to NYC for one reason. What a sense of community it inspires! For one day everyone comes together for the same purpose and has got each other’s backs. Fun Fact: In 2012 the marathon was canceled due to Hurricaine Sandy. Thousands of runners showed up to Central Park and ran 26 miles anyway. They collected donations for Sandy relief!  It’s inspiring! Trust me the feeling is like no other. I cry every year. I try not to but at some point I cry when I see a runner struggling during the race or overcoming a physical limitation but participating and loving it. No matter what your life situation is I dare you to come and watch and not be moved by the experience.  My favorite reason to love the NYC marathon is that it is a big, brash celebration of life. Everyone gets a runners high! Even if you are not running just cheering on the runners is exhilarating! You can cheer, dance and sing along the side lines and no one is going to stop you. In fact everyone will join in. Everyone loves a party and this one is irresistible.  </p>
<p>*In loving memory of Arthur Duffy (1928-2016). Love and light.*</p>

<p>Just a little over four months after Ben Affleck delivered a swirling, slurring defense of the New England Patriots in the inaugural episode of HBO’s “Any Given Wednesday,” the network has decided to cancel the Bill Simmons-hosted series. </p>
<p>In a statement on Friday, HBO said that the show’s next episode on Nov. 9 will be its last. HBO and Simmons mutually agreed to end the series, the network said, after the show failed to gain traction and even started to lose viewers at an increasingly fast pace in recent weeks.</p>
<p>However, Simmons’ other properties, including his massive Channel 33 podcast network and sports and culture site The Ringer, appear to be safe. HBO Sports executive vice president Peter Nelson said Friday that the network remains “committed” to Simmons, despite the show’s failure, and hopes to have him work on other HBO Sports programming in 2017. </p>
<p>“Bill is an award-winning executive producer in the documentary arena, and we will work closely with him in developing new and engaging content for our subscribers,” Nelson said. </p>
<p>Simmons reportedly signed a three-year, $20 million deal with HBO last year after his very public breakup with his former network, ESPN, where he became one of the most famous sports writers in the country and later created Grantland, a boutique sports and culture website that the network shut down shortly after he left.</p>
<p>In his own statement, Simmons took the blame for the inability of “Any Given Wednesday” to connect with HBO’s audience. </p>
<p>“One of the many reasons I joined HBO was to see if we could create a show built around smart conversations for sports fans and pop culture junkies,” Simmons wrote in a statement. “We loved making that show, but unfortunately it never resonated with audiences like we hoped. And that’s on me. But I love being a part of HBO’s family and look forward to innovating with them on other ambitious programming ideas over these next several years ― both for the network and for digital. With that said, I want to thank the dedicated staff that worked so diligently with me behind the scenes to make this show every week ― we hired so many great and talented people and I loved having them in my life. It’s difficult for me to imagine not working with them anymore.”</p>
<p>So that is that: “Any Given Wednesday” is dead. But hey, at least we’ll always have this bizarre promo for it. </p>

<p>Draymond Green is the positionless, mercurial All-NBA selection for the Golden State Warriors. And in case you haven’t heard, he isn’t one to mince words. So when he tells reporters that “teams are trying to punk” the Warriors, he means it.</p>
<p>But whether or not Green appreciates the fact, there’s a good chance that such treatment will only accelerate the team’s growth. That’s what happens when the NBA’s all-time winningest single-season team goes out and poaches Kevin Durant, creating an embarrassment of riches the rest of the world can only envy.</p>
<p>During the Warriors’ 106-100 defeat of Phoenix last week, Suns guard Brandon Knight knocked over Stephen Curry after he made a 3-pointer. It was a blatant foul, but officials didn’t call it as such. Curry retaliated, shoving Knight into the stands and receiving a personal foul.</p>
<p>In sports, one year can make all the difference, and the Golden State of today compared to last season is a perfect example. As Jerry West ― who serves as a consultant for the franchise ― told me recently, the term “villain” aptly describes the new-look Warriors. The 2015 and 2016 Warriors, by contrast, were anything but. West should know: He was the last member of the organization to speak with Durant before he signed.</p>
<p>Hard as it may be now, the 3-1 Warriors can take solace in the fact that they are no longer the league’s darlings.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s not exactly the same thing, but the Miami Heat faced similar antipathy when the Big Three were formed in 2010. In LeBron James, fans saw a young superstar ― entering his prime and supposedly “chasing rings” ― and responded with a flood of vitriol that ended up poisoning the team’s public image.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Last week, during Durant’s second game with the Warriors ― a 122-114 road win over New Orleans ― he picked up a technical foul after shoving Pelicans guard Lance Stephenson. Apparently, he felt Stephenson was being overly physical. </p>
<p>“They’re going to come at us physically,” Durant said after the game. “We took it tonight. That team was pressuring us to try to get us out of our stuff.”</p>
<p>The truth is that as talented and imposing as Golden State surely is, the acquisition of Durant signals massive changes in the way this team will operate, and not just offensively.</p>
<p>Durant is a wonderfully versatile defender who can protect the rim, but he’s a very different defender from the more physical Harrison Barnes, who’s now in Dallas. Andrew Bogut, an elite rim protector himself, has also gone to the Mavs. </p>
<p>From an offensive standpoint, Durant’s ability as a spot-up shooter is world-class. But does that mean Klay Thompson won’t receive the same number of shots ― or the same types of shots? Does it mean Draymond Green will be less of a playmaker, given Durant’s creative abilities? And what does it do to the maestro himself, Mr. Curry?</p>
<p>These are all things that take time to figure out ― and the process doesn’t get any easier when you’re the game circled on everyone else’s schedule, as the Warriors will be for the foreseeable.</p>
<p>“This is not coming easily,” head coach Steve Kerr said following the win over the Suns ― a win that uncharacteristically featured 16 Warrior turnovers. “We have a new team and a lot of different faces, but even for the returning guys, it’s a different mix.”</p>
<p>It’s worth remembering that it took 25 games for the Dubs to take their first L in 2015. It took all of one for it to happen this season.</p>
<p>“Our offense is not going right now like it will,” Green said after the Suns game.</p>
<p>Predicting the NBA is a tough business, but it seems safe to assume Green isn’t wrong.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Miami’s Big Three limped to a 9-8 start in 2010, only to reach the finals that season and then win two consecutive titles in 2012 and 2013. For a team with the Warriors’ star power, early challenges like what we’ve seen could very well give way to growth and success down the road.</p>
<p>“We’ll find our stride eventually,” Kerr said.</p>

<p>Former NFL running back Kevin Turner suffered from the most advanced stage of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a degenerative disease linked to repeated brain trauma, when he died at age 46, researchers at Boston University announced Thursday.</p>
<p>Turner, who played eight seasons with the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles, died in March of what was initially considered complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. But in a press conference Thursday, Dr. Ann McKee, the director of Boston University’s CTE Center, said Turner did not in fact have ALS. Rather, his advanced CTE was causing similar symptoms.</p>
<p>“The severity of Mr. Turner’s CTE was extraordinary and unprecedented for an athlete who died in his 40s,” McKee said in a news release. </p>
<p>Turner began playing football at the age of 5. Researchers who studied his brain believed the length of his career contributed to the development of the CTE. Research has shown that the length of a player’s career could be a key factor in the development of the disease later on.</p>
<p>“We believe the extreme severity of Kevin Turner’s disease is related to his 25-season career, and the fact he began playing tackle football at age 5, while his brain was still rapidly developing and more vulnerable,” said Dr. Robert Cantu, a Boston University neurosurgeon.</p>
<p>Turner was a plaintiff in the class-action lawsuit that more than 4,500 former players brought against the NFL, claiming that it mishandled concussion treatment and withheld information about the long-term effects of the injuries from players. The league reached a settlement of the lawsuit in 2015, but some players have since appealed.</p>
<p>Turner pledged to donate his brain to CTE research in 2010, when he was initially diagnosed as having ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s disease. He believed football had contributed to the development of the neurological disease.</p>
<p>“While learning the results has been devastating to Kevin’s family and those of us close to him, unfortunately, we cannot say we are surprised,” said Tamara Alan, the executive director of the Kevin Turner Foundation, which Turner founded in 2010 to raise awareness about ALS and brain trauma. “We will continue to honor Kevin’s wishes that we bring attention to this devastating disease.”</p>
<p>More than 95 percent of the donated brains of former NFL players showed signs of CTE in a 2015 study conducted by Boston University and the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>

<p>Kobe Bryant hasn’t endorsed a presidential candidate, but he’s pretty sure you can figure out who he’s supporting.</p>
<p>“I think we don’t have to all randomly guess what side of the fence that I’m on,” Bryant said Tuesday morning at the launch of his first post-retirement Nike sneaker, the “Kobe A.D.”</p>
<p>“For those that support the opposite of what you believe my point of view ... and if you know me for many years, I think you know what candidate I’m supporting ... then God bless you, that’s your point of view,” the former Los Angeles Lakers shooting guard said.</p>
<p>Speaking at the MAMA Gallery in Los Angels, Bryant also praised current NBA players including LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Carmelo Anthony for their efforts as athletes who promote social justice.</p>
<p>“I think it’s great. What I’ve tried to do on the back end of that is help the youth understand what those issues are,” Bryant said, according to ESPN. “What is the system that can help you understand what those issues are? It’s one thing to say we need change, but what does that actually look like? What are the issues that we need to vote on and understand?”</p>
<p>In the past, Bryant has spoken highly of President Obama. He even released the POTUS-inspired Kobe X Elite “Commander” sneaker in conjunction with Nike.</p>
<p>“Kobe has long looked up to the commander-in-chief, and not just because of his hoops game,” Nike explained at the time, according to The Hill.</p>

<p>CLEVELAND - The Chicago Cubs set up a winner-take-all Game Seven of the World Series by crushing the Cleveland Indians 9-3 on Tuesday to level Major League Baseball’s best-of-seven championship.</p>
<p>Facing elimination, reigning Cy Young Award winner Jake Arrieta won his second of the series, backed by 22-year-old shortstop Addison Russell, who smashed a grand slam on his way to logging a World Series record-tying six runs batted in.</p>
<p>Anthony Rizzo and Kris Bryant, who had four hits, also homered for Chicago, who erupted for 13 hits off six Indians pitchers.</p>
<p>The victory kept alive the Cubs’ quest of winning their first Fall Classic title in 108 years, and for the second time in as many games Chicago put on hold Cleveland’s celebration of a first World Series crown since 1948.</p>
<p>“Anybody who plays this game grows up dreaming of winning a World Series,” said Bryant, 24. “We get to play in a Game Seven tomorrow, that’s pretty special.”</p>
<p>One of the teams will end their drought on Wednesday, but Cleveland fans who came to celebrate a Game Six clincher on an unusually warm night were deflated and left the ballpark early as the Cubs romped.</p>
<p>“It’s OK,” said Leah Hoheaverger, who left before the end of the eighth inning as fans streamed out of Progressive Field. “We are used to being the underdogs.”</p>
<p>Arrieta pitched 5-2/3 innings, giving up three hits and two runs, striking out nine in registering the win helped by four relievers.</p>
<p>The desperate Cubs entered the game with a team batting average of .210 with only 10 runs in the first five games and were shut out twice.</p>
<p>CUBS ROAR</p>
<p>But the National League champions, who led the majors with 103 wins in the regular season, quickly turned the game into a laugher with two big innings.</p>
<p>The Cubs roared out of the gate with three runs in the first, two coming on a huge gaffe by Cleveland outfielders.</p>
<p>Bryant crushed a hanging curve from losing pitcher Josh Tomlin to left-center for a two-out home run.</p>
<p>Anthony Rizzo and Ben Zobrist lined singles before Russell slapped a pop fly that center-fielder Tyler Naquin and right-fielder Lonnie Chisenhall allowed to drop between them in a communication lapse.</p>
<p>Rizzo trotted home and Zobrist charged around the bases, bowling over Roberto Perez to score.</p>
<p>“In the regular season, crowd noise is not that loud,” second baseman Kipnis explained. “It’s tough when you have to keep looking up and down to see who is waving you off.”</p>
<p>Russell fully earned his next four RBIs.</p>
<p>The shortstop rocked a grand slam over the wall in center to score Kyle Schwarber, Rizzo and Zobrist ahead of him to make it 7-0.</p>
<p>The bases-loaded blast gave Russell six RBIs for the game, which tied him with Bobby Richardson (1960), Hideki Matsui (2009) and Albert Pujols (2011) for most in a World Series game.</p>
<p>Cleveland got their first hit and first run in the fourth when Kipnis doubled and scored on Mike Napoli’s single. Kipnis homered in the fifth to make it 7-2.</p>
<p>A two-run shot by Rizzo in the ninth and a last-gasp run by Cleveland closed out the contest.</p>
<p>Game Seven will be played in Cleveland on Wednesday with the Indians starting ace Corey Kluber, winner of two games already this series, against Chicago’s Kyle Hendricks, the National League ERA leader.</p>
<p>“It’s Game Seven,” said Indians manager Terry Francona. “You’ve got two really, really good pitchers, and it will be exciting. It’s an honor to even be a part of it, and we’re going to give it everything we have.”</p>

<p>Cliff Avril entered the NFL in 2008 as a third-round draft pick out of Purdue. He landed in Detroit, and instantly made an impact rushing the quarterback for the Lions, earning All-Rookie honors as a defensive end. While football was his primary focus, Avril soon envisioned the game as a platform for making a positive impact in the community.</p>
<p>“When I first got in the NFL, I had an inkling and I had a feeling that I wanted to do some things in the community,” Avril tells The Huffington Post. “But for me, I was worried about people not supporting me because I wasn’t really known. As I matured a little more, got married, had kids ― my view and vision on life changed completely.”</p>
<p>Avril’s vision became clearer after a few years in the league: He wanted to help others on a larger scale. His parents are both from Haiti ― the Caribbean island nation suffering in the wake of a devastating 2010 earthquake and now again from Hurricane Matthew ― and he traveled there every summer until he was 15 years old. Naturally, his interest in helping Haiti resurfaced, especially given that it’s the poorest country in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>“I was thinking more of what I can do for these kids,” the 30-year-old says. “Then going out there and seeing it firsthand, I was like, ‘I want to go out there and build them a whole school.’ Initially it was just a classroom, and they tried to get donors and other people to try and come up with the rest of the money for the school. I said, ‘Screw that, I just want to do it myself.’”</p>
<p>Avril, through the Cliff Avril Family Foundation and a partnership with an organization called Free the Children, started by fixing up two classrooms. Two turned into four, which turned into seven.</p>
<p>Once he reached that number, Avril decided to construct an entire school. But it wasn’t merely the infrastructure ― it is built to withstand natural disasters ― that needed special attention. A new school also meant better textbooks and making sure the children actually had shoes, a luxury most could not afford for the 90-minute walk to and from school every day.</p>
<p>During a visit following the earthquake, Avril and his wife, Tia, realized that there was an even larger problem developing at a local orphanage. </p>
<p>“Cliff had told me all the stories about Haiti,” Tia tells HuffPost. “I was all on board. We get to this remote community where the people were so passionate about education. They just had so many obstacles. They were just so appreciative.”</p>
<p>One of the key obstacles was something as basic as water.</p>
<p>“They showed us a water reservoir of where they store all their water,” Avril says. “They literally had 1 inch of water left in it. It’s crazy because we knew we wanted to give them water but they were literally on their last inch. ... It was very humbling.”</p>
<p>As he learned more, Avril realized that perhaps the largest need ― even more so than schools ― was actually housing. “How can kids go to school if they don’t even have a place to sleep?” Avril started asking himself.</p>
<p>After joining forces with the Baltimore Ravens’ Elvis Dumervil, the two are now helping build permanent homes for families throughout Haiti.</p>
<p>“We’re using all Haitian workers to help stimulate the economy,” Avril says. “And every sack I record this season [his 7.5 sacks are tied for third in the NFL], results in one new home in Haiti. After the hurricane, I just felt like I needed to do something right now. We partnered with The Mission of Hope ― whether its feeding people or providing water [for one full year] and medical assistance, we had to make an immediate difference.”</p>
<p>While Avril ― whose three forced fumbles are tied for second in the league ― was touched by his experience, he was also humbled by the influx of support he received from fellow NFL players, including Seahawks teammates. Michael Bennett, Richard Sherman and former Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch have all joined the cause. Lynch actually joined Avril in Haiti and physically helped build the school.</p>
<p>“When we were done, I looked at the school and just felt really proud,” Lynch tells HuffPost.</p>
<p>Avril believes that more players will want to be involved, but only when they make the trek to Haiti and experience the poverty for themselves.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to bring guys with me next year to see the situation,” he says. “You know, everyone has a different view on how bad the situation is in America but it can always be worse, and that’s definitely one of the countries where you can see that.”</p>
<p>The curious part for Avril is that while education plays an increasingly important role in his life today ― he and Tia have two young boys ― that wasn’t always the case. In fact, even at Purdue, Avril’s focus was almost entirely on the gridiron. </p>
<p>“Honestly, school didn’t get important to me until my third year in the NFL when I went back to graduate,” he says. “Now don’t get me wrong, I went to school because I knew I needed an education. ... I didn’t value it as much as I should have growing up, it was just something that I had to do. I thought, ‘How am I going to set a precedent for my child to go to school and to get a degree if I went to school for free?’ That’s why I went back and graduated.”</p>
<p>Avril, who is enjoying his ninth professional season and who was recently nominated for the 2016 Walter Payton Man of the Year Award, earned a Super Bowl ring with the Seahawks in 2014 and signed a four-year, $28.5 million contract extension that will keep him in Seattle through 2018. </p>
<p>With that in mind, he believes that now is the time to keep pushing and to keep educating those who will listen. It’s why he has brought a mobile medical clinic to Haiti, hosted a football camp and organized nearly 30 community events in both Washington state and Florida this year.</p>
<p>“There was a time [in Haiti] when there was just food sitting on the tarmac at the airport,” he says, “because certain help groups were saying it was theirs, while other ones were saying, ‘No, it’s ours,’ so it just sat there until they figured out whose food it was to get credit for helping people.”</p>
<p>“Are you looking for notoriety, or are you looking to actually help?” he says. </p>
<p>For Avril, there really is only one answer to that question.</p>

<p>Jeurys Familia, an All-Star closing pitcher for the New York Mets who recently appeared in an ad campaign against domestic violence, was arrested for domestic violence on Monday, the Bergen Record reports. </p>
<p>Fort Lee, New Jersey, police accused Familia, identified as Jeurys F. Mojica, of causing “bodily injury to another,” according to a complaint posted Tuesday by The Record. The victim, whose name is redacted from the complaint, had “visible injuries, specifically a scratch to the chest and bruise to the right cheek.”</p>
<p>Familia, 27, was arrested after an officer who responded to the incident “found probable cause to believe domestic violence had occurred,” the complaint states. The athlete was charged with simple assault, and bail was set at $1,500. </p>
<p>In a statement to The Record, the Mets said, “The matter was brought to our attention and we are monitoring the situation.”</p>
<p>Familia was among a number of athletes who recently starred in an ad campaign sponsored by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence.</p>
<p>In the video below, Familia, a native of the Dominican Republic, says in Spanish that he’s “not a fan” of domestic violence.</p>
<p>New York City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito helped launch the #NotAFan campaign, which also features Yankees manager Joe Girardi, former New York Knicks star John Starks, New York Liberty rising star Kiah Stokes, hockey Hall of Famer Rod Gilbert, and others. </p>
<p>Mark-Viverito said Tuesday that she was “deeply disturbed by the allegations” against Familia and called on Major League Baseball to conduct a thorough investigation. </p>
<p>“We created #NotAFan so fans can communicate that domestic violence is absolutely unacceptable and to give a voice to fans who didn’t have one before. I will be reaching out to the Mets and the Familia ads will be removed from the campaign,” Mark-Viverito said in a statement.</p>
<p>Familia’s photos were indeed gone from the campaign website on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The pitcher signed with the Mets in 2007 and made $4.1 million this season, according to MLB.com. </p>
<p>In August of last year, MLB announced a new domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy. Since then, three players have been suspended.</p>
<p>On Halloween 2015, then-Colorado Rockies shortstop José Reyes was arrested in Hawaii after allegedly assaulting his wife, Katherine Ramirez. The domestic abuse charge was eventually dropped. Still, MLB suspended the infielder 51 games without pay. Reyes has since signed with the Mets. </p>
<p>Aroldis Chapman, now a closing pitcher for the Chicago Cubs, received a 30-day suspension in March following an October 2015 incident in which he reportedly hit and choked girlfriend Cristina Barnea in his home before firing off eight gunshots in the garage. </p>
<p>And in May, Atlanta Braves outfielder Hector Olivera received an 82-game suspension after he was arrested in April at a hotel outside of Washington, D.C., and charged with assault and battery of a woman.</p>

<p>Ben Simmons is done with the NCAA, in more ways than one.</p>
<p>After one uneven season at Louisiana State University, the point forward prodigy has escaped to the NBA, where he was drafted as the No. 1 overall by the Philadelphia 76ers in June. Simmons’ lone year in the NCAA was mired in controversy, capped off in March when ESPN reported Simmons hadn’t met the academic requirements to win the Wooden Award, given to the best player in college basketball each year. </p>
<p>His time at the school quickly soured his once-sterling reputation, and left NBA teams and fans alike whispering about issues related to maturity and dedication. But in “One and Done,” a new Showtime documentary about Simmons set to debut on Friday, the Australian-born phenomenon hopes to give his side of the story. And his side of the story is none too kind to the institution he felt forced to play under due to an NBA rule that requires athletes be 19 years old and one year removed from high school before they join the league. </p>
<p>“The NCAA is really f**ked up,” Simmons reportedly says in the documentary, according to ESPN. “Everybody’s making money except the players. We’re the ones waking up early as hell to be the best teams and do everything they want us to do and then the players get nothing.”</p>
<p>The trailer for Showtime’s “One and Done,” premiering Friday, Nov. 4</p>
<p>Simmons apparently spends much of the documentary, created by Maura Mandt and Josh Swade, lambasting the NCAA for forcing him to do things that won’t benefit the players, but will benefit the people who control them. “Don’t say I’m an amateur and make me take pictures and sign stuff and go make hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars off one person,” he says at one point. </p>
<p>While Simmons is exaggerating slightly when he says the NCAA is making “hundreds of thousands of millions of dollars” off him alone, the money-making capabilities of the organization are unambiguous. Earlier this year, the NCAA announced it had agreed to sell the rights to eight years’ worth of its March Madness basketball tournament for $8.8 billion. Any way you measure it, the NCAA is making big-time money off a system that provides its most valuable employees with a scholarship and little more.</p>
<p>“I’m going off on the NCAA. Just wait, just wait,” Simmons says in the documentary. “I can be a voice for everybody in college.”</p>
<p>“One and Done” premieres Friday on Showtime at 9 p.m. ET/PT.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you just need a hug.</p>
<p>Take Seattle Seahawks safety Earl Thomas. He was clearly overcome with emotion on Sunday after he recovered a New Orleans Saints fumble and returned it for a touchdown.</p>
<p>Thomas could have embraced any number of teammates, but instead decided to show some unsolicited affection to a referee.</p>
<p>Of course, the NFL’s strict rules for touchdown celebrations are pretty well documented. And a person doesn’t typically become a referee to win over any player’s heart.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the love was not reciprocated. As the video shows, the official penalized Thomas for unsportsmanlike conduct, without hesitation.</p>
<p>The Saints beat the Seahawks, 25–20.</p>

<p>The NBA season is here, and it is amazing.</p>
<p>The on-court storylines are plentiful. Can Russell Westbrook average a triple-double? Can Anthony Davis continue to destroy the league? Will the Warriors ever figure this thing out? Will LeBron make a justifiable case that he deserves to stand alongside Jordan?</p>
<p>Those are important questions, yes, but the truth, is they pale in comparison to this one: How cute is this new “Lion King Cam” the Phoenix Suns rolled out on Sunday night? The answer is: Very cute.</p>
<p>Every team, adopt this now!</p>

<p>Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez had been using drugs and alcohol at the time of a fatal boat crash that left him and two others dead, an autopsy report reveals.</p>
<p>Fernandez, 24, had cocaine and a blood alcohol level of .147 in his system during the September crash, the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner’s office said Saturday, according to CNN. </p>
<p>The star pitcher was boating with friends Emilio Macias and Eduardo Rivero early on Sept. 25 when the boat hit rocks and capsized. Authorities said speed also played a factor, but they could not determine who had been driving the boat.</p>
<p>The Marlins drafted Fernandez in 2011. He played his first MLB game in 2013. Fernandez was the youngest Cuban-born player to make an All-Star debut, according to the Miami Herald. He won the National League Rookie of the Month Award twice.</p>
<p>Following the first Marlin’s game after Fernandez’s death, second baseman Dee Gordon launched a lead-off home run while wearing his friend’s jersey.</p>
<p>“Unbelievable,” an announcer said after Dee’s home run. “Just unbelievable ― his eyes wet with emotion as he rounded the bases, his first home run of the season.” </p>
<p>CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said Fernandez’s blood alcohol content was less than the legal limit. His blood alcohol content was two times over the legal limit to drive.</p>

<p>It’s no secret that actor Bill Murray ― the man, the myth, the legend ― is a die-hard Chicago Cubs fan.</p>
<p>So it was only fitting that Murray was granted the honor of performing “Take Me Out To The Ballgame” during the seventh-inning stretch of Game 3 of the World Series Friday night.</p>
<p>The game against the Cleveland Indians was the Cubs’ first World Series game at Wrigley Field since 1945.</p>
<p>Murray took the microphone, looked out over the stadium and its electric crowd and did what he does best ― he made magic.</p>
<p>“We didn’t come here to drink beer. We came here to win this ball game,” the impassioned actor screamed. The Indians had just taken a 1-0 lead over his beloved Cubs.</p>
<p>“I said to the Uber boy, I said, ‘Take me out with the crowd,’” Murray proclaimed, hyping up the audience and offering instruction on how to sing the song.</p>
<p>“In order to say the right lyric, ‘Take me out with the crowd,’ you need to sing it like our greatest American entertainer, Mr. Daffy Duck,” Murray explained.</p>
<p>“So I want you to spray it and don’t say it,” he said, mimicking the iconic cartoon character. Then he launched into the best version of the seventh-inning song ever.</p>
<p>The Indians held on to defeat the Cubs 1-0 Friday to take a 2-1 series lead.</p>
<p>No matter which team you’re rooting for, we can all agree on one thing: Bill Murray puts on one helluva show for his dear old Chicago Cubs.</p>
<p>Last week, Murray, decked out in Cubs gear, crashed a White House briefing room to predict a Chicago league championship victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. </p>

<p>The Philadelphia 76ers apologized Friday for not allowing singer-songwriter Sevyn Streeter to perform the national anthem at the team’s opening season game Wednesday because she wanted to wear a shirt that said “We Matter.”</p>
<p>“We are sorry that this happened,” the team said in a statement. “After receiving feedback from our players, basketball operations staff and ownership group, we believe that the wrong decision was made, and Sevyn should have been welcome to sing. We apologize to her.”</p>
<p>Streeter, who has written song for artists including Usher and Ariana Grande, revealed that team had decided not let her perform in the shirt in a video published to Twitter on Wednesday night. Afterward, she told the Associated Press that she felt “extremely, extremely angry, and disappointed and honestly brought to tears by all of it. It broke my heart.”</p>
<p>Streeter added that she believes the U.S. cannot continue to silence protests that hope to improve the treatment of people of color in the country.</p>
<p>“We live in the greatest country in the world, but there are issues that we cannot ignore,” she said. </p>
<p>The 76ers’ first statement on its refusal to let Streeter perform, released shortly after the Wednesday night game, did not deny her account of the incident. Rather, it said the organization wanted to “move from symbolic gestures to action.”</p>
<p>To try and right its wrong, the team has offered to let Streeter sing the anthem at a game of her choosing. The organization has yet to hear back. </p>

<p>A jury in Pennsylvania on Thursday awarded more than $7 million in damages to a former Penn State University assistant football coach who said the school retaliated by firing him after he implicated Jerry Sandusky as a molester of young boys.</p>
<p>The $7.3 million in compensatory and punitive damages Penn State was ordered to pay Michael McQueary was confirmed to Reuters by Kendra Miknis, chief administrator of the Centre County Court of Common Pleas in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>McQueary, claiming a loss of reputation and a $140,000-a-year coaching job in 2012 for his role as a whistleblower against Sandusky, had sought more than $8 million in damages.</p>
<p>McQueary, who coached wide receivers for legendary Penn State head coach Joe Paterno for eight seasons, told state investigators in 2011 that he had seen Sandusky, a retired but still-revered coach, in the shower having sex with a young boy 10 years earlier while McQueary was still a graduate student.</p>
<p>He also implicated Timothy Curley, the university athletic director, and Gary Schultz, a Penn State vice president who oversaw the campus police department, in a cover-up. Sandusky, now 72, was not arrested for 10 more years.</p>
<p>He was tried and convicted in 2012 of molesting 10 boys and was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.</p>
<p>Paterno was fired for his role in the Sandusky scandal and died months later. McQueary never worked anywhere of note after his dismissal, he said, because other schools viewed him as damaged goods. He had ostensibly lost his job because the new head coach, Bill O’Brien, did not want him.</p>
<p>McQueary also claimed in his lawsuit that former Penn State president Graham Spanier defamed him in a public statement in 2011 that publicly defended Curley and Schultz.</p>
<p>Elliot Strokoff, a lawyer for McQueary, told Reuters earlier Thursday that he would not be able to comment on the verdict because Judge Thomas Gavin has a gag order in place. Penn State attorney Nancy Conrad told media much the same. A university spokesman also declined to comment.</p>
<p>In an unusual arrangement, the jury ruled on defamation and misrepresentation claims made by McQueary against Penn State, but Gavin himself will rule within 30 days on the whistleblower part of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>McQueary “should not have been a scapegoat,” Strokoff said during closing arguments Thursday morning. “They said that he is the villain and that he is only in court because of his own failures.”</p>
<p>Conrad told jurors in closing that McQueary was not defamed by Spanier in 2011 and argued that his failure to find a job since 2012 was his own fault, not Penn State’s.</p>
<p>“He was not damaged by any actions of the university,” Conrad said. “If he was harmed, it was by national media and public opinion. He failed to find a position because of his own shortcomings.”</p>
<p>McQueary’s lawsuit took four years to come to trial.</p>

<p>The Chicago Cubs have been waiting 108 years to see a win at the World Series. And so has one their longest-running fans: Mabel Ball.</p>
<p>“You keep hoping that they’ll keep on doing well and getting to the top,” the 108-year-old told ABC7 News from Northbrook, Illinois, where she now lives in a retirement community.</p>
<p>She didn’t attend a game at Chicago’s Wrigley Field until she was 90.</p>
<p>“I was busy,” she told the Chicago Tribune. She worked on her family’s dairy farm north of the city, so she would listen on the radio.</p>
<p>“Mom had the games on,” her son, Richard Ball, confirmed. Her favorite player, he said, is probably Ernie Banks, an African-American hall-of-famer who played for the Cubs from 1953 to 1971.</p>
<p>“Go, Cubs, go!” she exclaimed. “I’m going to root for you more than ever.”</p>
<p>Game 3 of the World Series will take place Friday night. The Cubs are currently tied 1-1 with the Cleveland Indians.</p>

<p>Singer-songwriter Sevyn Streeter was scheduled to sing the national anthem at the Philadelphia 76ers season opener on Wednesday. She never did, she said, because the team didn’t approve of her shirt, which read “We Matter.”</p>
<p>“I’m at the 76ers game to sing the national anthem, and the organization is telling me that I can’t because I’m wearing a ‘We Matter’ jersey,” she said in a video posted to her Twitter page. </p>
<p>Streeter, who has written songs for artists including Usher, Ariana Grande and Alicia Keys, later said that she was only told her shirt was unacceptable a few minutes before she was set to sing. A source told Fox News’ Lauren Dawn Johnson that the Sixers offered alternative outfits, which Streeter refused, since she was never “given any kind of dress code,” she said.</p>
<p>“I was angry, extremely, extremely angry, and disappointed and honestly brought to tears by all of it. It broke my heart,’’ she told the Associated Press. “Honestly, I was very excited about being able to perform the national anthem. I was really looking forward to that.”</p>
<p>Streeter said that she believes “we live in the greatest country in the world, but there are issues that we cannot ignore.” </p>
<p>“I ... felt it was important to express the ongoing challenges and ongoing injustice we face as a black community within the United States of America,” she added.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to USA Today Sports, the 76ers did not deny Streeter’s claim, rather saying they hoped to move “from symbolic gestures to action” when it comes to enacting social change:</p>
<p> The Philadelphia 76ers organization encourages meaningful actions to drive social change. We use our games to bring people together, to build trust and to strengthen our communities. As we move from symbolic gestures to action, we will continue to leverage our platform to positively impact our community. </p>
<p>Just as the football field has become an arena for social protest this year, so has the national anthem at NBA games. Earlier this month at a preseason game between the 76ers and Miami Heat in Miami, singer Denasia Lawrence wore a “Black Lives Matter” shirt and knelt during her rendition of the national anthem.</p>

<p>The Orlando Magic in their season opener Wednesday paid tribute to the 49 people killed in the June massacre at the city’s Pulse nightclub ― the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. </p>
<p>“Tonight we honor their lives, the heroes who emerged that early morning and a healing community that showed the world love always conquers hate,” the team’s announcer said during a pre-game ceremony.</p>
<p>The ceremony included a moment of silence for the victims, a performance of “Forty-Nine Times” by Brandon Parsons, and the raising of a No. 49 banner inscribed with the names of those who were slain. </p>
<p>Orlando’s Amway Center, the Magic’s home arena, is located less than two miles from the gay club where 49 people were killed and 53 were injured on June 12 by an American-born gunman who had pledged allegiance to ISIS. </p>
<p>The Magic announced this month that the team would dedicate its home opener to Pulse victims. Magic CEO Alex Martins predicted before the game that fans were in for an emotional evening. </p>
<p>``Quite frankly, I will be shocked if there’s a dry eye in the house,’’ he told OrlandoMagic.com, adding that he expected the ceremony to include around 300 survivors, family members of victims and first responders.</p>
<p>During warmups, Magic players took to the court wearing #OrlandoUnited shirts with rainbow heart logos.</p>
<p>Martins said prior to Wednesday’s game that he was proud of how the Orlando community quickly rallied after the shooting to show that love will prevail in the face of hatred.</p>
<p>``This was an event that shook our community and shook our country ― we’re talking about the largest mass shooting in the history of our country,’’ Martins told OrlandoMagic.com. “So it shook our community, but it also brought our community together. I think tonight will be symbolic of how our community has come together since then and how it continues to remember those who were the most impacted.”</p>
<p>The team and the family of billionaire team owner Richard DeVos earlier donated $500,000 to the OneOrlando Fund, a nonprofit established to assist victims’ families.</p>
<p>DeVos’ donation was met with backlash from those who pointed to his long history of supporting anti-LGBTQ efforts.</p>
<p>The Magic lost Wednesday’s game to the Miami Heat, 108-96. </p>

<p>The Cleveland Indians’ return to the World Series has brought renewed attention to the team’s Chief Wahoo logo, a cartoon caricature that many Native Americans have sought to change for decades.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the team itself said it would phase out the use of the logo, but it has been ubiquitous on Cleveland’s hats and uniforms during the postseason.</p>
<p>That could change soon, as MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said Wednesday that he would sit down with Cleveland owner Paul Dolan after the season to discuss the logo, which he admitted “is offensive to some people.”</p>
<p>“I know that that particular logo is offensive to some people, and all of us at Major League Baseball understand why,” Manfred said at the Hank Aaron Award ceremony in Cleveland. “Logos are, however, primarily a local matter. The local club makes decisions about its logos. Fans get attached to logos. They become part of a team’s history. So it’s not easy as coming to the conclusion and realizing that the logo is offensive to some segment.”</p>
<p>“I’ve talked to Mr. Dolan about this issue,” he continued, via the New York Post. “We’ve agreed away from the World Series at an appropriate time we will have a conversation about this. I want to understand fully what his view is, and we’ll go from there. At this point in this context, I’m just not prepared to say more.”</p>
<p>Multiple Cleveland fans have been spotted wearing red-face and feathered headdresses during the first two games of the World Series, drawing attention to the controversy over the logo’s continued use leads to further inappropriate caricatures of Native Americans. Protesters, meanwhile, have gathered outside Progressive Field in Cleveland to demand the team quit using it.</p>
<p>Manfred, at least, appears to be listening to those who want the logo changed.</p>
<p>But the issue isn’t nearly as complex as Manfred suggests it is, even if he’s only trying to be diplomatic before sitting down with Dolan. Over the last four decades, hundreds if not thousands of high schools, universities, and even pro sports teams have changed such mascots to avoid the legitimate negative psychological and sociological effects they have on Native American communities. It’s actually not that hard to choose logos and mascots that don’t have a detrimental effect on anyone.</p>

<p>Um, who let this guy in?</p>
<p>That seems to be the very calm, cool reaction of the Oklahoma City Thunder’s Russell Westbrook, after an angry Philadelphia 76ers fan flipped him off midway through the first quarter of Wednesday’s game.</p>
<p>“Can he do that?” Westbrook seemed to ask the referee.</p>
<p>This layup seemed to set off the 76ers fan:</p>
<p>Twitter erupted in support of Westbrook and his “perfect” reaction. Multiple users called for the Philadelphia fan to be removed. Soon after the outburst, game officials did just that, and escorted the man, who was wearing an Allen Iverson jersey, out of the arena.</p>

<p>Grant Hill was such a special basketball player that fans once called him “the next Jordan.” A two-time national champion at Duke University and the third overall pick in the 1994 NBA draft, Hill earned co-Rookie of the Year honors and seven All-Star selections during his 19-year career.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Hill’s brilliant career was hampered by a series of devastating injuries, mainly to his foot. </p>
<p>As the 2016 NBA season gets underway, the 44-year-old ― who now works for TNT and NBA TV as a broadcaster ― caught up exclusively with The Huffington Post to discuss the league’s dramatic stylistic changes, describe why he wishes he could have played today, and explain how young big men are stunted by the changing role of the point guard.</p>
<p>From both a preparation and physical standpoint, have you found that playing and broadcasting share any similarities? </p>
<p>Obviously, there’s no physical toll that comes with broadcasting like playing, but there is a preparing for your opponent aspect ― shoot-around, walk through, understanding matchups, the game plan.</p>
<p>So much of being a player is understanding players’ tendencies: What is a team trying to accomplish and how can we go about trying to limit them or restrict them from having success? As a broadcaster, whether in the studio or broadcasting games, you have to prep ― you watch tape, you read, you talk to people.</p>
<p>One of the things when I’m calling a game, because I’ve been around the league so much, I like to talk to beat writers of the local teams. They’re really dialed in with what’s happening. Part of broadcasting is reading, reacting and explaining what’s happening to the viewer at home, but like any kind of test or presentation where preparation is required, it’s best to be overly prepared.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I enjoy that. That’s one of the aspects I enjoy, getting into the weeds, preparing for a game, and when you’re at the game, it’s the closest thing to playing. That’s why I like to say it’s the best things from playing, but you don’t have to worry about the result. You don’t live and die by the results like you did as a player.</p>
<p>Can you explain the difference between watching film as a player and now as a broadcaster?</p>
<p>I would imagine that a former coach that transitions to television brings that coach’s perspective when you start watching tape. I would tend to watch more from a player’s standpoint, sprinkled in with coaching. A lot of it, for me, is understanding players and their tendencies. When I was a player, I would watch a team that we were going to play in the coming days: I [wanted] to get a sense from everybody on the court ― what does the point guard like to do? The big guy, what are his tendencies? And you can pick that up by watching tape.</p>
<p>So when you’re in the game, even though it might not be your player, you might make a read or you might have seen something ― a tendency from watching film that can help you adapt or help make you a steal or anticipate something. Now, [as a broadcaster], you’re doing that in preparing for two teams, as opposed to just preparing for one.</p>
<p>Can you remember another time when the league had such an influx of top-flight point guard play?</p>
<p>No, this is the era of the point guard position. In the mid-’90s, the point guards didn’t shoot as much. They ran the offense, and the emphasis was on the big guy and wing players. Now it’s a point-guard-driven league, and as a result, point guards have adapted.</p>
<p>Look, to be competitive nowadays, you have to have good lead guard play. You have to have guys that are little that can play with the ball in pick-and-roll, and can also get you a basket and carry the team, and that was not part of the game 20 years ago. That’s just part of the evolution, it goes hand in hand with the change in the big guy’s role.</p>
<p>Young big men today are entering the NBA as “stretch” players, far more comfortable facing the basket away from paint than with their backs to the basket on the block. </p>
<p>I think it’s the chicken or the egg theory. The style of play has changed, and it has trickled down to the grass-roots level. When I was young, [if] you were tall, you were encouraged to play with your back to the basket. You worked on post moves, and the school of thought was, “If your feet aren’t in the paint, you don’t shoot.” That was the traditional model, but now, as the game has evolved and we’ve opened the court up shooting more from the perimeter, there’s more spacing.</p>
<p>They’re teaching big guys to handle the basketball ― to shoot, to play where they’re facing the basket. What came first? I think the style of play changed and forced everyone to sort of fit into a box and play that style of basketball. It has changed ― it’s a different league, not just at that position, but at the point guard position, perimeter play. And I’m not saying one is better and one’s worse, but like anything, things change and evolve, and the style of play in the NBA has evolved to what it is today.</p>
<p>Is it fair then to say the bigs are limited because of the increased scoring role of the point guards?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think to a degree, one could say the style of play 20 years ago hurt the point guard. You still need to have good big men, people on the interior who can defend, who can be in that roll position to be effective. But you don’t have to be the dominant centerpiece in this style of play in order to be successful.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, we don’t have as many ― the Shaqs, the Ewings and the David Robinsons. You used to have a number of big guys who were really good and effective and you could throw the ball into the block for them 25 times a game, and they could carry you. Part of that is because we’re beginning to condition them at an early age to play more out on the perimeter.</p>
<p>How would you have enjoyed playing in this era as opposed to when you entered the NBA in the mid-’90s?</p>
<p>When I was young in Detroit, my strengths and what separated me was my ability to handle the basketball, and as a big guy, handling the ball like a point guard. To be able to play in this kind of era, I would have loved it. I would have loved to have the ball in my hands, to be a decision-maker, to make plays for myself and my teammates. It’s more open, there’s not as much physicality.</p>
<p>When I was in Detroit, I was a point-forward. We had shooters out there on the floor, Terry Mills, Joe Dumars, Lindsey Hunter, and there was a lot of screen-and-roll with me. But the possessions per game were down ― we only averaged 89 points. We weren’t running up and down the court. We were playing very methodical, defensively grinding it out. Every possession was critical, and it was a wrestling match at times. It was, opportunistically, get out and run, but if you don’t have numbers, let’s slow it down and let’s be very deliberate in our attack.</p>
<p>What insight and knowledge did you gain toward the end of your playing career, particularly when you were no longer a focal point of the offense?</p>
<p>That last year [with the Clippers] was a valuable experience because now I have an understanding of what it’s like to be an older player, not playing and dealing with the emotions with retirement on the horizon. But also, we had young guys who weren’t playing, so now I’m able to interact and work out with them and just understand the challenges that they went through.</p>
<p>I feel like with the Hawks [Hill is vice chairman of the Atlanta Hawks], I can talk to a guy and in a lot of ways relate to what they’re going through, because I’ve lived many lives as a player. So even that last year where I didn’t play was a hugely valuable experience.</p>
<p>Would you possibly be open to a Grant Hill documentary ― perhaps an ESPN “30 for 30” ― detailing what actually went down as far as your career and the way you were deceived regarding your injuries?</p>
<p>I got a story! I think some of what I’ve gone through and what really happened ― particularly with the injuries and that ordeal four years, five years, and then coming back. There’s a lot that went into that and a lot of people don’t know what happened. Not to call people out, it’s not about that, but to relive what happened.</p>
<p>People ask me, “What are you most proud of?” My career had different phases. In the early part, it was really good, and then the difficult middle part in Orlando and really all that came with that, and the end, where I was able to reinvent myself and find tremendous value and fulfillment from playing more in a complementary role. </p>
<p>When I look back and reflect, there are three different roles, but I’m most proud of going through what I went through and being able to overcome that. That four years, there’s a lot that happened. I know when I’ve spent a good hour or two going through and explaining things, people are like, “Wow, I had no idea.” </p>

<p>No “angry Michael Phelps” faces for this news.</p>
<p>The swimming superstar and Nicole Johnson were married in a secret ceremony on June 13 — well before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, where it was widely reported that the couple was engaged.</p>
<p>TMZ first broke the news after obtaining the couple’s marriage license. The Paradise Valley, Arizona, ceremony was officiated by Phelps’ agent, Peter Carlisle.</p>
<p>Several keen observers have noted that the couple may have dropped a hint on their actual wedding day. An Instagram post from Johnson dated June 13 shows the happy couple and their son with the caption, “Such a memorable night with my lil fambam.”</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Phelps flatly denied that the covert wedding took place during a Facebook Live appearance, telling fans, “I’m not married yet.”</p>
<p>“I am not telling you the date of the wedding,” he said. “That’s a super secret. You guys will know soon, though.”</p>
<p>It appears that we now know.</p>
<p>The couple’s son, Boomer — who is pretty cool — was born on May 5.</p>

<p>Richard Sherman may play for the Seattle Seahawks. But when it comes to magic, he’s Gryffindor all the way.</p>
<p>The All-Pro cornerback showed his true team spirit by dressing up as Harry Potter for his weekly press conference, according to FoxSports.com. Sherman showed up wearing a robe, glasses and the Gryffindor house tie.</p>
<p>He even carried a wand, which he pointed at reporters in the crowd, as this video by Seattle Times Seahawks beat writer Gregg Bell shows:</p>
<p>Sherman said he dressed up early for Halloween at the request of his son, according to CBS Sports.</p>
<p>“This is a serious occasion ― it’s Halloween,” Sherman told reporters. “My son told me he wanted me to wear something, so it’s happening.” </p>
<p>Harry Potter isn’t just a one-time costume for Sherman, a self-proclaimed nerd.</p>
<p>He said that his favorite Potter film is “Order of the Phoenix,” and that he’s definitely a Gryffindor.</p>
<p>Journalists, used to asking tough questions about upcoming football games, took the opportunity to ask more pressing questions, according to the Seattle Times:</p>
<p> Question: “What’s harder, Quidditch or five quarters of football?” Sherman: “Five quarters of football is pretty tough, but Quidditch, the beaters, the chasers, trying to find the golden snitch, things like that, that’s tough. Five quarters of football, though, in the elements, I’d say that takes the cake.” Question: You said that was your first and second choice for a costume. What was it about that costume? Sherman: “When you’re a wizard, like we are out here, sometimes you have to show it to the muggles in the world. We’ve got a lot of wizards. My son’s a wizard. Earl Thomas does some magical things. Michael Bennett is Black Santa, but he’s also a wizard. You just have a good time. I just went to Harry Potter Land. That felt like home.” </p>
<p>One question asked about Sunday’s game with the Cardinals, which ended in a tie, but Sherman turned it back to Harry Potter.</p>
<p> Question: “How long after the Cardinals game did you start feeling human again? Or are you?” Sherman: “Um, well, I’m definitely a wizard. So if you’re asking if I feel like a muggle again, I don’t.” </p>

<p>Three years ago last month, Jonathon Simmons stepped into a gym in Austin, Texas, for one final shot at fulfilling his dream of making the NBA.</p>
<p>His decision to enter the draft after one season at the University of Houston had been a failure. He hadn’t even made a summer league team, let along gotten drafted. Now, here he was at Concordia University, where he paid a $150 registration just for the right to show the San Antonio Spurs’ development league team that he had what it took to make it in.</p>
<p>The process in the years before that were hard. He had gone to two community colleges. He had four daughters he needed to feed. He was just about to give up and pursue another one of his talents: cutting hair. But he stepped into that gym, and he impressed.</p>
<p>Flash forward three years later to Tuesday night, and Simmons wasn’t only in the NBA. He was destroying Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant and the heralded Golden State Warriors in their first game of the season.</p>
<p>Simmons, 27, who joined the Spurs as a rookie last season, let the world know he belongs. He registered 20 points, three three-pointers, a +33 plus-minus, three rebounds and one absolutely monstrous monster block on two-time reigning MVP Stephen Curry. </p>
<p>He also registered a buzzer-beating three to end the half for good measure.</p>
<p>In what was supposed to be the first of many dominating nights for the Warriors following their signing of Kevin Durant, fans in the Bay Area instead could only watch on in horror as the Spurs dismantled the NBA’s newest super-team, 129–100. Kawhi Leonard was a big part of the reason for the dominating victory, as was LaMarcus Aldridge. But so was Simmons, much to the chagrin of his opponents.</p>
<p>“We let Simmons come in and destroy us in the first half, and he continued it in the second half. No disrespect to him, but you can’t let guys like that come off the bench and get 20,” Draymond Green said after the game. “It’s hard to win like that. I don’t care where you’re at.”</p>
<p>Whatever happens this season, Simmons started it with a bang. If nothing else, he has made his presence known. “It takes different people different paths,” Spurs general manager R.C. Buford said last year. “Clearly, his wasn’t linear.”</p>
<p>Highlights from Jonathon Simmons game against the Golden State Warriors.</p>
<p>CORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly said Simmons’ tryout occurred at Concordia College. It occurred at Concordia University in Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>Chicago Cubs fans are a passionate and resilient bunch ― but most haven’t been dedicated for as long as Jim Schlegel.</p>
<p>Schlegel, a 97-year-old Pearl Harbor veteran and die-hard Cubs fan, attended games the last time the Cubs made it to the World Series ― in 1945. He even has his ticket stubs from Game 6 and Game 7.</p>
<p>But the Cubs lost that Series. And for 71 disappointing years since, Schlegel has been cheering his team, hoping for another shot at the championship. </p>
<p>Now, the Cubs are back.</p>
<p>After decades of what some might call a curse, the Cubs are headed for the World Series again. And, thanks to Schlegel’s thoughtful granddaughter, Helen, he’ll be in the stands cheering, “Go, Cubs, Go” with the best of them.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Helen Schlegel set up a GoFundMe called “Get my Grandpa to the World Series” with the goal of raising $10,000 ― enough to buy two tickets to a World Series game.</p>
<p>The campaign caught the eye of Marcus Lemonis, Host of CNBC’s “The Profit,” who just so happened to be looking for a Cubs fan worthy of free World Series tickets. Jim Schlegel was the perfect fit.</p>
<p>Lemonis donated two front-row Game 3 tickets to Schlegel, who said he’ll be taking his son to the game against the Cleveland Indians on Friday at Wrigley Field.</p>
<p>“My grandpa is beyond excited to go to the game,” Helen Schlegel told The Huffington Post. “It all just feels so unreal still.”</p>
<p>“I appreciate your generosity, and hope we bring in a winner,” Schlegel told Lemonis in a video posted to Twitter by his granddaughter.</p>
<p>Even before he knew he would be attending the Series, Schlegel sounded confident in his beloved team: “The Cubs will win it in seven. Or earlier. Alright?” he said in an interview this week with FOX 32.</p>
<p>All of the money raised by the GoFundMe campaign ― more than $12,000 so far ― will be donated to the Purple Heart Foundation, which supports U.S. military veterans.</p>
<p>Enjoy the game of a lifetime, Mr. Schlegel.</p>

<p>If you are in-the-know, then you knew it was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>After the Golden State Warriors lost their season opener to the San Antonio Spurs on Tuesday night, it was really a matter of “when,” not “if.” But that didn’t make it any less comical, nor any less ridiculous, when ESPN’s “First Take” ― the show hosted by Mr. Hot Take himself, Stephen A. Smith ― put out the question this Wednesday morning: Is it time to say Kevin Durant has made the Warriors worse?</p>
<p>Ignoring the fact that Durant dropped 27 points on 11-18 shooting to go along with 10 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 blocks and 2 steals, and ignoring the fact that the Warriors were forced to find themselves on the fly in their first game of the season against the most prepared and professional competition they will face their side of the Mississippi, the question is still wonderfully ridiculous on its face.</p>
<p>In what world should someone cast a judgement on a team, or, for that matter, on an employee or a human, after one day’s work? The answer, of course, is in Stephen A. Smith’s world, where it’s never too soon to jump to conclusions. </p>
<p>Is it panic time in The Bay? No, but it is hot-take time in Bristol, Connecticut. </p>

<p>Caris LeVert entered the University of Michigan in 2012 as a three-star prospect. The school was his only Power Five offer, and LeVert was a relative afterthought compared to the program’s star players who joined that year, including future pros Trey Burke, Tim Hardaway Jr., Mitch McGary, Nik Stauskas and Glenn Robinson III.</p>
<p>But just three years later, LeVert ― selected 20th overall in June’s NBA Draft ― is poised to become one of the league’s top young players. In fact, a lingering health question was the only reason he wasn’t selected in the lottery, after he endured three foot fractures in three years of college.</p>
<p>At 6-foot-7 and with a staggering 6-foot-10 wingspan, the Columbus, Ohio, native represents the new age, prototypical NBA wing. LeVert can legitimately guard three positions ― a skill few possess ― and he can score as well.</p>
<p>In 15 games as a senior last year, he averaged nearly 17 points while converting 45 percent from distance. Better yet, LeVert offers remarkable versatility as a playmaker and is a consistent wing rebounder, averaging five assists and five rebounds per game.</p>
<p>The modern NBA game, more so than ever before, rewards that versatility. Can you create matchup problems? And better yet, can you solve matchup problems?</p>
<p>Golden State’s Draymond Green is a great example of this new setup. An unconventional four or even five man for the Warriors, Green ― like LeVert ― doesn’t so much have a “position.” Green is often employed as a center with one lineup, only to assume point-forward duties with another. LeVert doesn’t have the ability to play as many spots on both ends as the All-NBA Green, but he offers a similar skill set. </p>
<p>And aside from No. 1 overall pick Ben Simmons, the 22-year-old LeVert may have been the most dynamic two-way player in the entire draft class. From an offensive standpoint, he is an effective isolation player and expanded his pick-and-roll game every year in college, a valuable asset in itself. Teams that have capable pick-and-roll wings ― think the Warriors (Klay Thompson), Rockets (James Harden), Raptors (DeMar DeRozan), Clippers (Jamal Crawford) and Blazers (C.J. McCollum) ― become extremely difficult to defend in the half-court, and in turn are some of the league’s top flight offenses.</p>
<p>We certainly cannot expect the same out of the Nets, as the team has gone into complete rebuilding mode, shipping off all of their previously valuable assets save for center Brook Lopez. But the good news for LeVert is that recently minted head coach Kenny Atkinson will employ an up-tempo, motion-based offense ― a far cry from the plodding style of former coach Lionel Hollins.</p>
<p>LeVert excelled playing in a similar style in college for John Beilein, a creative offensive mind who loved to get his athletes out in space, while also relying on ball movement and dribble-drive in the half-court.</p>
<p>And LeVert, to his credit, is hardly lacking in confidence.</p>
<p>“I was a lottery type of talent,” he told reporters recently.</p>

<p>Three Senate Democrats want the 2017 Women’s U.S. Open moved from a Donald Trump-owned golf course in New Jersey, they said in a letter to the United States Golf Association on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Given the historic role that the [Ladies Professional Golf Association] has played in advancing the rights of women, and the severity of Mr. Trump’s words and actions over many years, we would encourage you to move the 2017 tournament to a course that isn’t associated with Mr. Trump,” Sens. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) wrote in the letter. “We would also strongly recommend that the USGA seriously consider suspending further events at Trump properties.” </p>
<p>The USGA has faced renewed calls to move the event in recent weeks, after The Washington Post released a 2005 video in which Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, openly talked about forcing himself on women without their consent.</p>
<p>“The decision that the USGA makes is more consequential than simply the geographic location of a golf tournament,” the senators wrote. “In declining future association with a brand that degrades women, the USGA and LPGA have an opportunity to make clear to the world, and most especially young Americans, that our nation will not tolerate nor do business with anyone or any company that condones or excuses action that constitutes sexual assault.”</p>
<p>The USGA did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter, which was addressed to Mike Davis, its CEO. The USGA manages the Women’s U.S. Open, though many of the players are LPGA Tour members. </p>
<p>Mike Whan, the head of the LPGA, faced questions about the event during a tournament in South Korea earlier this month. </p>
<p>“In a strange way, I’m lucky that the LPGA has no direct dealings with Donald Trump or Donald Trump properties,” Whan said, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>Golfweek interviewed a dozen LPGA players during the South Korea event and found that most had no objection to keeping the event at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.</p>
<p>English golfer Jodi Ewart Shadoff, however, said the event should be relocated.</p>
<p>“On principle, I feel it’s just not right,” she told Golfweek. </p>
<p>The USGA, LPGA, PGA Tour and PGA of America all distanced themselves from Trump in July 2015, after he launched his campaign by asserting that Mexican immigrants were criminals and rapists and said that his partners in the golf world “know I’m right.” </p>
<p>The PGA Tour moved an annual event from Trump’s Doral course in Miami to a new location in Mexico City, but said at the time that the decision was motivated by a sponsorship issue, not his campaign for president.</p>
<p>Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.</p>

<p>When the stakes are high, emotions can be too.</p>
<p>In a confrontation that recently aired on ESPN and went viral online, Canadian Griffin Benger just couldn’t take any more of British player William Kassouf’s incessant chatter during the World Series of Poker Main Event in Las Vegas. Benger finally called him on it in the firmest way possible ― and at the perfect time.</p>
<p>Benger, holding two aces to Kassouf’s two kings, had just raised with 5.6 million chips. Shedding his stoicism, Benger snapped at Kassouf: “You’re just an abusive person, man. It’s not funny. It’s not a game. You’re being abusive to me. It’s called verbal abuse ... You’re a bully. It’s rude. It’s mean. ... Check your privilege.”</p>
<p>Kassouf, known for his verbal gamesmanship, explained that his “speech play” was part of the game. He then went all in to bring the pot to 27,800,000 chips. Benger called.</p>
<p>The five community cards were revealed. Benger’s two aces held up to capture the pot.</p>
<p>But now we wonder: who played whom?</p>
<p>In a karmic postscript to their July encounter noted by Fox Sports, Benger advanced to the November Nine final table at the World Series of Poker, where he is assured of at least $1 million in winnings. Kassouf finished 17th, going home with more than $300,000.</p>

<p>Following the lead of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, a high school football official in North Carolina took a knee during the national anthem at a Friday night game.</p>
<p>The official, who was one of five overseeing a game between Southwest High School and Croatan High School, has yet to be identified, and the North Carolina High School Athletic Association did not immediately return The Huffington Post’s request for comment.</p>
<p>Nearly two months after Kaepernick first refused to stand during a 49ers preseason game in protest of the mistreatment of people of color in the U.S., football players from youth school up to the NFL have joined him in silently protesting before games. Some have dealt with punishment and harsh words as a result. The Denver Broncos’ Brandon Marshall lost sponsors. A team of 11-and 12-year-olds saw their season cut short. </p>
<p>The official appeared to face at least some similar ridicule on Friday night, as made clear from attendees of the game who spoke out on social media. </p>
<p>One day after the game, North Carolina General Assembly Representative Phil Shepard sharply criticized the unnamed official. “I just think it’s not right to do that at a high school football game, especially for a official paid by the North Carolina High School Athletic Association,” he said, according to a local paper. </p>
<p>Over 800 people have been killed by police in the U.S. this year, according to a tally by The Guardian. While a study recently made headlines for alleging that police did not actually use violence against black Americans at a disproportionate rate, the study was roundly described as flaw by other scholars. Much more evidence still points sharply in the other direction.</p>

<p>The New York Giants released Josh Brown on Tuesday, roughly a week after the public release of documents that showed Brown admitting to physically beating his then wife in 2015. </p>
<p>“We believed we did the right thing at every juncture in our relationship with Josh,” team president John Mara said in a statement. “Our beliefs, our judgments and our decisions were misguided. We accept that responsibility.” </p>
<p>Mara added, “We hope that Josh will continue to dedicate himself to rehabilitation, and to becoming a better person and father. We will continue to support him in his efforts to continue counseling, and we hope that Josh and his family can find peace and a positive resolution.”</p>
<p>Brown served a one-game suspension during the Giants’ 2016 season opener as a result of his arrest last May on domestic violence charges.</p>
<p>The charges were later dismissed. But last week, NFL.com published a story based on 165 pages of documents resulting from Brown’s 2015 arrest, in which Brown admitted he physically, verbally and emotionally abused his then wife, Molly Brown, who separately told police Brown had physically abused her 20 times, including while she was pregnant. (The couple has since filed for divorce.)</p>
<p>The league, which faced criticism from police over its initial handling of the case, soon after placed Brown on the temporary exempt list while an investigation was underway, which meant he could not participate in practices or games, but could get paid. He did not fly with the Giants to London for their Week 7 game.</p>
<p>Brown put out two similar but not identical statements on Tuesday. In one, which was released through the team, he said he hoped to improve as a person and bring about positive change. But in a separate statement released through ESPN’s Adam Schefter, Brown strongly denied ever beating his wife.</p>
<p>“It is important to share that I never struck my wife, and never would. Abuse takes many forms, and is not a gray area,” he said. </p>

<p>These Cubs fans are roaring.</p>
<p>The lions outside of the Art Institute of Chicago received Cubs hats on Monday morning in honor of the team’s first trip to the World Series since 1945. WGN TV provided live coverage of the caps being placed on the statues around 8 a.m. ET. </p>
<p>As the pictures below show, getting a hat on these animals takes a bit of work. </p>
<p>The Art Institute’s support of the city’s sports teams has become a Chicago tradition. In the past, the lions have worn Bears, White Sox, and Blackhawks gear during those teams’ championship runs.</p>
<p>Of course, it has been a while since the Cubs were in the World Series. This marks the first time these lions have sported Cubs hats. </p>

<p>Funny obviously runs in the family. James Corden let his sisters loose on an NFL game in London recently ― and the result was pure comic gold.</p>
<p>You won’t even care who won the game between the Indianapolis Colts and the Jacksonville Jaguars (OK, the Jaguars did). In a now-viral bit that “The Late Late Show” presented ahead of another NFL game in England ― Sunday’s contest won by the Giants over the Rams ― Andrea and Ruth show American sportscasters how it’s done.</p>
<p>Confessing ignorance, they learn the finer points of the game, cut up at a press conference, watch the game, then visit the winning Jaguars’ very naked locker room. “We’re gonna hold it together,” Andrea says. “We’re gonna be pros.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, it didn’t turn out that way.</p>

<p>The Chicago Cubs dispatched the Los Angeles Dodgers with power and pitching on Saturday to win the National League pennant and reach their first World Series in 71 years.</p>
<p>The Cubs, for more than half a century viewed as the lovable losers of old ivy-covered Wrigley Field, beat the best pitcher of the now generation in Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw in a 5-0 victory that clinched the National League pennant, 4-2.</p>
<p>Next up, the Cleveland Indians and the Curse of the Billy Goat.</p>
<p>The long-suffering Cubs head to Cleveland on Tuesday to begin a best-of-seven for Major League Baseball’s championship with a chance to end the longest title drought in major North American professional sports ― 108 years ― and erase a fabled curse.</p>
<p>Anthony Rizzo and Willson Contreras blasted home runs to support the two-hit pitching of Kyle Hendricks and Aroldis Chapman that sent Cubs fans into delirium, rocked the 102-year-old stadium in Chicago and ignited a city-wide celebration.</p>
<p>Transformed by a new management regime led by team president Theo Epstein, who also helped the Boston Red Sox exorcise the Curse of the Bambino with their first Series win in 86 years, the Cubbies will enter the 112th Fall Classic as favorites after a major league-leading 103 regular season wins.</p>
<p>The Indians had their own history of sporting futility in the city on the southern shore of Lake Erie once nicknamed the “Mistake on the Lake”, going without a World Series title since 1948.</p>
<p>But no club touches the ordeal of the Cubs, whose deprived fans have waited four decades longer than their Cleveland counterparts.</p>
<p>The Cubs were an early power in the major leagues, winning their second World Series in a row in 1908 in the fifth edition of the Fall Classic.</p>
<p>The Cubs remained a strong team over the next few decades but kept falling short in the World Series. They were runners-up in six World Series in the years following when they once again won the National League pennant for another crack at the title in 1945.</p>
<p>THE CURSE</p>
<p>Legend has it that Billy Goat Tavern owner Billy Sianis was asked to leave Game Four of the 1945 Series at Wrigley Field against the Detroit Tigers because the odor of his pet goat, Murphy, was bothering other fans.</p>
<p>Outraged, Sianis cursed the Cubs on his way out of the World Series game, shouting they would never win another.</p>
<p>Seventy-one years later, and 108 years in total, the Cubs and their fans are still waiting.</p>
<p>These Cubs look well equipped to end the drought.</p>
<p>Built by a combination of shrewd trades, draft choices and heavy spending on the free agent market, the new Cubs have a young, power-hitting team featuring third baseman Kris Bryant, first baseman Rizzo and shortstop Addison Russell.</p>
<p>They support a veteran starting rotation anchored by Cy Young winner Jake Arrieta, Jon Lester, National League ERA leader Hendricks and John Lackey.</p>
<p>Led by manager Joe Maddon, brought in last season as the final piece of their championship puzzle, the Cubs went from 101 losses in Epstein’s first season in charge in 2012 to one step from baseball heaven.</p>

<p>Ultra-runner Pete Kostelnick hit the road on September 12th, his 29th birthday, commencing his journey from San Francisco City Hall to run across America. His goal? To break Frank Giannino’s 36-year-old trans-America record of 46 days 8 hours 36 minutes (recognized by Guinness World Records) for the fastest crossing of the United States by foot. Some forty days later, Pete has chipped away at the expedition of 3,100 miles with consistency, and if he keeps at his incredible 72+-mile-a-day average, he should arrive at New York City Hall by Monday, October 24th, days ahead of the standing record. </p>
<p>Forrest Gump Lives</p>
<p>Pete’s running resume is filled with great feats: to put his speed in perspective, Pete’s marathon best is a time of 2:41:06 in 2015 at the Lincoln, NE Marathon. Regarding his ultramarathon achievements, in 2013 he ran 423 miles in seven days across Iowa at the Ragbrai, and in 2015, he won Badwater 135. In December of that year he went on to run 163 miles in 24 hours at the Desert Solstice 24 hour, and in 2016, he broke the course record at Badwater 135, running the challenging race in an incredibly fast 21:56:32. But running wasn’t always Pete’s forte; in fact, his running journey commenced years back, when he weighed 200 pounds and entered the Marine Corps Marathon to shed some weight. In addition to trimming down, over the next few years, Pete discovered his natural talent and fervor for running far and fast. </p>
<p>Accountability</p>
<p>Pete is not taking any chances as he traverses the country with a world record in mind. He runs with a satellite transceiver which records his every move so that his progress is trackable. In addition, Pete wears two GPS watches at all times—in case one fails—and his support team gathers witness signatures, takes videos and photos, and assembles media reports daily. While running across the country is typically a lonely endeavor, Pete has had a host of running companions across various states, which makes his progress easy to follow on social media. His journey is one of discipline and numbers which serve to validate his record-breaking attempt.</p>
<p>The Daily Grind</p>
<p>Pete’s typical day on the road is a twelve-hour haul. He wakes while most of us are asleep at 3:30 a.m., and by 4:00 a.m., he hits the pavement. He typically covers 40 miles pre-lunch, and then adds on some 30 additional miles each afternoon. His pace is smooth and steady, and typically in the 9.5-minute mile range. Most days, he breaks between 4:00 - 5:30 p.m. for dinner and a massage, and is in bed in the support RV by 7:00 p.m. He aims for a solid eight hours of sleep, until it’s time to do it all again. To date, Pete has endured a host of weather patterns, to include snowstorms, thunderstorms, high winds, and mountain passes. </p>
<p>No great adventure can occur without the proper support. In Pete’s case, he travels with a power team of four who reside between two support vehicles and the RV, which serves as his home-away-from-home. It’s the team’s job to leapfrog him every step of the way, manage supplies, prepare meals, provide medical assistance, and supply logistical support. While only Pete is running, his crew is 100% invested in his success.</p>
<p>The Menu</p>
<p>Fuel and mental strength is what keeps Pete moving forward. He consumes roughly 13,000 calories daily to sustain his unstoppable 72+-mile-a-day pace. For his first breakfast of the day at 3:30 a.m., Pete eats hot cereal, toast, a banana and a protein shake before he stops some 40 miles later for his second breakfast of eggs, more breads and fruits, and another protein shake, which fuels his next 30 miles. </p>
<p>According to Cinder Wolff, a personal chef and licensed massage therapist who is a key member of Pete’s support crew, “Dinner has to be a rebuilding meal. This is the meal that allows Pete’s muscles to rebuild while he sleeps. It always has a protein, carb, and some veggies.” If they have been close to a store as Pete’s running day comes to an end, then ice cream is Pete’s treat for the night. Cinder stocks Pete’s RV nightstand with protein bars, water, juice, and sometimes animal crackers, so that he can snack through the night.</p>
<p>About Pete</p>
<p>Pete Kostelnick was born and raised in Boone, Iowa and graduated from Iowa State University with degrees in Finance and International Business. He is married to Nicole Larson, also a runner, and lives in Lincoln, Nebraska where he works as a financial analyst for National Research Corporation.</p>
<p>For those of you who want to join history in the making, Pete intends arrive at New York City Hall on Monday, October 24th, sometime between noon and 8:00 p.m. For live tracking of Pete, click here. </p>

<p>Yesterday, I led a workshop in large part about identities and what framework or lens we use with which we view the world, last night I realized how deeply being a Chicagoan, Cubs fan and survivor of the collapse of 1969 really meant to me. I remember my dad yelling in frustration at the television at our beloved Chicago Cubs who were in the middle of yet another whatever, blown save, blown game, blown playoff, he would be so frustrated and I would think, “what is the point?” What was the point of getting angry at the Chicago Cubs? Getting angry at the Chicago Cubs loosing, is a little like buying a ticket for the lottery and going out and getting a new car sure that you soon will have money for the payments.</p>
<p>As I look at what defines winning these days, I can’t help but notice that every time one of the Cubs got a hit they looked over to their teammates in the dugout and acknowledged them. There are no individual efforts on this team, younger players and older veterans, playing with joyful abandon, understanding the meaning they have for a fans that for years have come out for the beauty of the day, the friendliness of the confines and the hope that comes with each first pitch.</p>
<p>There was a wave of joy that exploded last night. I experienced it through fans and friends all over the world experiencing what feels like a once in a lifetime moment of joy. We need reminders of the possibility of hope, joy and love being rewarded in such a cynical world. We need reminders that there is more to life than political despair and endless conflict.</p>
<p>I cried last night not for the simple joy of a hometown sports team moving on in the playoffs, I wept because I still want to believe in hope and connection, that joy can fill collective hearts, and that we are still moved by the fun of the game. That is the point. We need to remember that in this world the possible always exists. Through all of the darkness, through all of the despair, through all of the acrimony, through all of our difference, there is always next year, and even when it seems like next year may never come, guess what, it just arrived.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Major League Baseball told the Associated Press on Friday that the choices had been made, and they didn’t include Sheen. MLB and the Cleveland Indians asked “former franchise greats” to throw out the ceremonial first pitch for the games in Cleveland. Sorry, Charlie.</p>
<p>Previously:</p>
<p>Charlie Sheen, once a fictional Cleveland Indians pitcher, wants to play a real role in the team’s World Series appearance.</p>
<p>The actor said on Thursday that he would “be honored” to throw out the ceremonial first pitch for a World Series game if called upon, outlets reported.</p>
<p>“Major League continues to be the gift that keeps on giving! if called upon, I’d be honored,” Sheen wrote on Twitter. </p>
<p>Fans had clamored for Sheen ― who played reliever “Wild Thing” Ricky Vaughn in the 1989 sports comedy “Major League” ― on social media after Cleveland defeated Toronto in the American League Championship Series.</p>
<p>The actor played a bespectacled hurler with control problems who was just one of many kooky characters on a hapless team that turns its fortunes around despite having an evil owner. He entered games to the song “Wild Thing.”</p>

<p>UPDATE: Brown has been placed on paid leave, USA Today reported Friday, citing unnamed sources “with knowledge of the situation.”</p>
<p>Previously:</p>
<p>New York Giants kicker Josh Brown won’t be traveling with the team for Sunday’s game against the Los Angeles Rams in London, a decision related to the NFL’s move to re-open an investigation into a domestic violence incident in May 2015.</p>
<p>Giants president and co-owner John Mara said Thursday in a radio interview with WFAN that the Giants are considering placing Brown on the commissioner’s exempt list. Mara also said the Giants won’t wait for the NFL to make a decision.</p>
<p>Mara said the Giants were aware of the abusive relationship, including the need for security to protect Brown’s ex-wife from the kicker at the Pro Bowl.</p>
<p>“He certainly admitted to us that he abused his wife in the past,” Mara said. “What’s a little unclear is the extent of that.”</p>
<p>New information was released by the state of Washington earlier this week, prompting the Giants to decide that Brown won’t play in Sunday’s game.</p>
<p>The NFL decided to is re-open its investigation into Brown in light of the release of additional documents regarding his 2015 domestic violence arrest.</p>
<p>Brown admitted to domestic violence in letters, emails and a journal, according to police documents released on Wednesday.</p>

<p>New York Giants kicker Josh Brown said that he was “physically, emotionally and verbally” abusive to his wife on several occasions, according to documents that surfaced Wednesday relating to the athlete’s domestic violence case.</p>
<p>Brown allegedly admits to ongoing abuse in the series of emails, letters, journal entries and counseling exercises obtained by NJ.com.</p>
<p>“I have physically, mentally, emotionally and verbally been a repulsive man ... I have abused my wife,” he wrote in one entry.</p>
<p>The King County Sheriff Department in Washington state obtained the materials from Brown’s former wife, Molly, during an investigation following Brown’s arrest in May, 2015. Brown was accused of fourth-degree assault, but the charge was later dropped. </p>
<p>In one entry, Brown said that he decided from the age of 7 to “use and abuse women.”</p>
<p>“My ability to connect emotionally to other people was zero,” Brown wrote. “My empathy levels were zero. Because I never handled these underlying issues I became an abuser and hurt [my wife] physically, emotionally and verbally. I viewed myself as God basically and she was my slave.”</p>
<p>The Giants re-signed Brown to a two-year, $4 million contract during the 2016 offseason.</p>
<p>“Based on the facts and circumstances that we were aware of at that time, we were comfortable with our decision to re-sign him,” Giants co-owner John Mara said in August.</p>
<p>Around the same time, the NFL issued a one-game suspension to Brown for violating the league’s personal conduct policy.</p>
<p>NJ.com notes that it is unclear if the Giants or the league were aware of the police documents prior to their being made public on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Giants did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Giants are scheduled to fly to London, where they will play the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.</p>

<p>Former Major League pitcher Curt Schilling has vowed to try and unseat Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in 2018. That is, if his wife approves.</p>
<p>“So, I’ve made my decision. I’m going to run,” the outspoken conservative said on WPRO radio Tuesday morning. “But ― but― I haven’t talked to Shonda, my wife. And ultimately it’s going to come down to how her and I feel this would affect our marriage and our kids.”</p>
<p>Schilling has openly discussed running for office as a Republican in recent months. The future Hall of Famer has even hinted that he wants to run for president in 2024.</p>
<p>Warren likely won’t be too worried about the matchup: In September, she led the former Boston Red Sox star 47 percent to 28 percent in a hypothetical race, a poll from UMass Amherst, WBZ TV, and WBZ NewsRadio found.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Warren declined to comment on Schilling’s Senate plans.</p>
<p>After retiring from baseball, Schilling became an analyst at ESPN, where his political views and penchant for sharing offensive memes on social media constantly landed him in trouble with his employer. ESPN suspended him in August 2015 for sharing a meme that compared Muslims to Nazis.</p>
<p>The network fired Schilling in April after he shared an offensive meme about transgender people ― an apparent reference to the controversy around North Carolina’s anti-transgender bathroom law.</p>
<p>Schilling is also a big supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The former pitcher has repeatedly called for the imprisonment of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and said she “should be buried under a jail somewhere” after she was accused of including classified State Department emails on a private server.</p>
<p>During the appearance, Schilling also refused to apologize for his role in the failure of 38 Studios, a video game company he launched that received a $75 million loan from the state of Rhode Island before collapsing.</p>
<p>This post has been updated to note a Warren spokesperson declined to comment.</p>

<p>GOLDBERG. IS. BACK.</p>
<p>After a 12-year absence from the squared-circle, Goldberg made his triumphant return to “WWE Raw” on Monday. The former WCW heavyweight champion received a roaring welcome – complete with chants of “Gold-berg! Gold-berg!” – as he accepted a challenge to fight current WWE superstar Brock Lesnar.</p>
<p>As always, the scene was electric. </p>
<p>“I thought to myself, ‘Maybe, I have one more ass-kicking left in me.’ I thought to myself, ‘Maybe, I have one badass spear left in me.’ Then I thought to myself, ‘Maybe, I have one last devastating jackhammer in me,’” Goldberg told the crowd.</p>
<p>“So, Brock Lesnar, not only does that mean that you’re next ... but most importantly, it means, Brock Lesnar, you’re last!”</p>
<p>No date is set for the match, but CBS Sports reports that it will most likely go down as the main event of Survivor Series on Nov. 20.</p>
<p>The people were excited, to say the least.</p>

<p>Los Angeles Dodgers player Adrian Gonzalez didn’t stay with his teammates at the Trump International Hotel in Chicago during an early season road trip, the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin reported Sunday.</p>
<p>“I didn’t stay there,” Gonzalez told reporter JP Hoornstra. “I had my reasons.”</p>
<p>Gonzalez didn’t explain further, and said he was focused on baseball, not politics, during the Dodgers’ NLCS matchup with the Chicago Cubs in May. </p>
<p>But as Hoornstra noted, there’s a fairly likely explanation: The Mexican-American first baseman probably isn’t fond of the derogatory comments Donald Trump has made about Mexicans during his presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Gonzalez has taken vocal political stands on immigration issues in the past. In 2010, he was among the players who spoke out forcefully against Arizona’s SB 1070 immigration law, and he briefly threatened to boycott the 2011 MLB All-Star Game in Phoenix.</p>
<p>“It’s immoral,” Gonzalez said of the Arizona law in 2010. “They’re violating human rights. In a way, it goes against what this country was built on. This is discrimination. Are they going to pass out a picture saying, ‘You should look like this and you’re fine, but if you don’t, do people have the right to question you?’ That’s profiling.”</p>
<p>The Dodgers aren’t staying at the Trump International during their NLCS matchup with the Cubs, the team told the Press-Telegram, because of logistical problems. Gonzalez, meanwhile, is hardly only American who has avoided Trump’s hotels and other businesses because of the positions the Republican presidential nominee has staked out during the campaign.</p>
<p>Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.</p>

<p>The NFL really needs to loosen up.</p>
<p>After taking a stand against Antonio Brown’s twerking and pelvic thrusts to celebrate touchdowns, the so-called No Fun League targeted a more innocent and creative TD gesture on Sunday.</p>
<p>Vernon Davis of Washington caught a touchdown pass against the Philadelphia Eagles and gently tossed the ball through the goal posts as if he were shooting a basketball.</p>
<p>But Davis was penalized for excessive celebration ― NFL rules say players can’t use the ball and goal posts as props.</p>
<p>The flag made his team surrender 15 yards on the kickoff. The Eagles’ Wendell Smallwood then took the shorter kick back 86 yards for a touchdown.</p>
<p>Consequences ― and all for a move that’s fun for fans and really isn’t all that in-your-face for opposing players.</p>
<p>Davis, whose teammate Josh Norman had been fined earlier this month for pretending to shoot an arrow after an interception, can rest easy, though. Washington still managed to win, 27–20. </p>

<p> Perhaps for obvious reasons, at the last minute, Lochte’s publicist decides to come along. “Work is slow,” she says. “It’s Yom Kippur.” “What’s that?” Lochte asks curiously. “It’s the Jewish Day of Atonement.” “Wasn’t it their Thanksgiving two days ago?” “That was Canadian Thanksgiving.” “Oh,” says Lochte, shifting his hands in his pocket and pulling out his phone, which, as it turns out, has been butt-dialing people. “Ha!” he says. “My friend was just on the phone for like five minutes!

<p>Who knew that taking your shirt off during a track race was forbidden?</p>
<p>French runner Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad, above, learned the hard way at the 2014 European Championships, when he was disqualified for whipping off his top on the home stretch of the 3,000 meter steeplechase.</p>
<p>“I did not know that I could be disqualified for such a thing,” he said at the time. “In every sports you can take your vest [off], only in athletics you cannot.”</p>
<p>He’s not the only elite sports star to fall foul of lesser-known sporting rules, however ― and it’s prompted Sports Betting Online to break just some of the more bizarre laws down in this handy infographic:</p>
<p>“At some point or other, following a freakish or specific incident perhaps, these rules were officially written down and ratified,” a Sports Betting Online spokesman told The Huffington Post via email.</p>
<p>“Only every now and then do they ever come up, and that’s usually in a pub quiz round,” he added. “Nevertheless, rules are there to be followed and for better or worse we all have to stick to them if we want to play the game.”</p>

<p>Dozens of Buffalo Bills fans gathered outside Ralph Wilson Stadium in Buffalo, New York, on Sunday and knelt during the playing of the national anthem before the team’s game against the San Francisco 49ers, in a show of solidarity with 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.</p>
<p>Kaepernick, who will make his first start of the season in Buffalo, has knelt during the anthem before games since the preseason to protest police brutality and killings of African Americans.</p>
<p>“We had been talking about doing this for a while even before we found out he was starting,” Caitlin Blue, a 21-year-old from Buffalo, told The Huffington Post, speaking by phone from outside the stadium. “We want to show that we support him because what he’s doing is very patriotic, and as Bills fans, we stand for racial justice.”</p>
<p>The protest was organized by Just Resisting, a group of organizers of people of color, and a local chapter of Showing Up For Racial Justice, which seeks to organize white people to stand up for racial equality. There were more than 40 protesters involved an hour before the game began, Blue said, with the number expected to grow by kickoff.</p>
<p>The groups, which gathered in a parking lot near the stadium before the game, carried signs that read “Black Lives Matter” and “Protest is Patriotic,” and others that bore the faces of famous athletes who have protested during sporting events. </p>
<p>The groups marched from the lot to the stadium, where they planned to kneel during the anthem as it played inside. Buffalo News reporter Nick Veronica posted a video of the march on Twitter:</p>
<p>The 49ers-Bills game took on political significance this week when San Francisco coach Chip Kelly announced that Kaepernick would start in place of the struggling Blaine Gabbert. Bills head coach Rex Ryan is a supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who has spoken out against Kaepernick and the Black Lives Matter movement during the campaign. Ryan introduced Trump at a Buffalo campaign rally in April.</p>
<p>Some Buffalo fans pushed back against Kaepernick’s protests before the game, with T-shirts and signs telling him to “shut up and stand up.” Some fans booed and chanted “U-S-A” before the game began, according to reports.</p>
<p>Blue said the protests received a mixed response from fans before the game.</p>
<p>“We expect there to be naysayers, we expect there to be people against us,” Blue said. “We’ve also seen lots of people that say they love what we’re doing.”</p>
<p>The protesters are also challenging Ryan’s support of Trump, who has faced a spate of sexual assault allegations in the last week.</p>
<p>“Rex endorses him, and continues to do so, even after Trump has talked about sexually assaulting women. We want people to know that’s not what Buffalo stands for at all,” Blue said.</p>
<p>“Some of the fans don’t really care, and that’s a problem,” she continued. “They should care about who’s representing them.”</p>

<p>The first step has been taken, but then it has been taken previously. Are we moving inexorably towards Armageddon? We will know in less than four weeks, and what we will know is not the results of the presidential election. We will know if the Cubs are about to end their long running March of Futility. Cubs fans around the world will remain focused on their team, rather than that other long March towards Armageddon. </p>
<p>One Hundred and Eight years is a long time. It represents at least five generations of Cubs loyalty and futility. </p>
<p>W.P. Kinsella, author of Shoeless Joe, the novel that became the film, "Field of Dreams," wrote a short story titled, "The Last Pennant Before Armageddon." In it there is a dream sequence central to the story involving the Chicago Cubs, their manager, and the World Series played in a time of turmoil with the potential of nuclear annihilation. A Cubs World Series win against the Dodgers in the seventh and final game of the series is central to the fate of the world. The story ends in ambiguity as the Cubs manager decides not to bring in his ace reliever to nail down the final out. The inference is that by his decision the Cubs manager has saved the world from destruction. </p>
<p>So if the Cubs win the World Series, and we do not yet know if they will even get there, what might be the consequences? The world is not likely to end, nor will it usher in nuclear destruction. Still it will be an earthshaking event because the Cubs have been mired in over a century of futility and growing frustration. </p>
<p>It will also be the end to what has become the "Cubs Brand." This is a baseball franchise that has embraced losing and developed a reputation as the lovable losers. The cuddly little bear cubs, the team symbol, seems to fit them perfectly. </p>
<p>I have been an interested observer of this streak for a long time, although not since 1908. I went back to check my files the other day and found that I first wrote about the Cubs epic suffering in the fall of 1984. The Cubs had opened the NLCS, a best of five game series, with two wins at home against the Padres. The action then moved to San Diego where the Padres won the next two games. In game four the Padres scored twice in the home ninth for a 7-5 win. In Game Five the Cubs entered the 7th inning with a 3-2 lead. Cubs starter Rick Sutcliffe was clearly out of gas. As the Padres pounded Sutcliffe, </p>
<p>Cubs manager Jim Frey seemed to be either paralyzed or mesmerized by events and watched it unfold, coming to the mound to remove Sutcliffe only after the Padres had scored four times.  In 1989 there was an eerily similar situation with the Cubs facing elimination in the NLCS against the Giants. This time the game was tied 1-1 in the 8th inning. Cubs manager Don Zimmer, high school classmate of the aforementioned Jim Frey, sat and watched as his starting pitcher, Mike Bilecki, walked three in a row. Zimmer, apparently channeling Jim Frey, did not move out of the dugout to make a pitching change until it was too late. The new pitcher immediately dished up a three run single to Will Clark, thus ending the Cubs season. </p>
<p>These events led me to conclude that perhaps there was something to the curse of the Black Cat which originated in 1969 when the Cubs blew a big lead in the pennant race to the Mets. The Cubs collapse followed the appearance of a stray black cat passing in front of the Cubs dugout at Shea Stadium. The Cubs then went into a tailspin and ended their season in free fall. </p>
<p>It was only much later that the Curse of the Billy Goat became a common part of Cubs lore. Although the basic elements of the story are true and date from the Cubs last World Series appearance in 1945, the notion of a Billy Goat Curse apparently was put together much later by the legendary Chicago columnist Mike Royko and his drinking pals. In the last couple of decades the story seems to have taken hold. </p>
<p>Then in 2003 the belief in a Curse on the Cubs took on another potent layer. With the Cubs leading 3-0 in the top of the 8th inning with one out, Luis Castillo of the Marlins hit a foul ball down the left field line. Moises Alou seemed about to field it when a longtime Cubs fan, Steve Bartman, reached out and attempted to catch the ball. No out was recorded. Castillo walked and the Marlin tsunami began. The inning ended on a pop fly by Castillo. By then the Florida Marlins had scored eight runs and tied the series at three games each. The Cubs went quietly in the 8th and 9th inning without as much as a baserunner. The next night the Marlins completed the burial at Wrigley Field. One win and indeed, only a few outs away from a National League pennant and trip to the World Series, the Cubs collapsed. </p>
<p>Cubs fans were incensed at Bartman and were now more convinced than ever that there was a Curse, be it Black Cats, Billy Goats, or some other sort of bad karma. The loveable losers were destined to remain losers. The pain was particularly sharp as many fans had convinced themselves that 2003 was at long last the year of the Cubs. It was not. As it turned out it was not even their century. One hundred years, a century of futility, would be achieved and then some. </p>
<p>Will this year be different? Looking at the current edition of the Cubs it would certainly seem so. This is a team with very few weaknesses, a rotating cast of heroes, and solid pitching with the possible exception of middle relief. They won over 100 games and had the best record in baseball. Surely this is the year. </p>
<p>And yet, these are the Cubs, the Chicago Cubs. </p>
<p>For me there is one main critical difference. Having watched the Cubs closely since the mid-60s when I was living in a Brave-less Milwaukee, it seems that this year will be different. Over the next few weeks I will be away from television coverage and unable to watch their continuing quest to end the streak. </p>
<p>The Cubs will break the streak for the simple reason that I will very likely not see it happen. Yes, I am the key to the end of the streak. Save me some champagne. I'll celebrate later. </p>
<p>Of course if I do happen to see the last game or two of the World Series involving the Cubs, then all bets are off. As to Armageddon, be prepared.</p>

<p>Dak Prescott wasn’t going to be a Dallas Cowboy. Certainly not if owner Jerry Jones had his way. </p>
<p>Flashback to the NFL Draft this past May and it was University of Memphis quarterback Paxton Lynch ― not Prescott ― whom the polarizing owner was targeting. Lynch, a 6-foot-7-inch flamethrower with a 36-inch vertical jump, offered more upside, at least in Jones’ eyes. But Denver general manager John Elway nabbed Lynch with the 26th pick overall, and the Cowboys then selected Prescott in the fourth round.</p>
<p>“I probably should have overpaid here,” Jones said at the time, regretting that he didn’t do a deal with Seattle to obtain the needed first-round pick. He was “still mad about it,” he said. </p>
<p>Either way, the Cowboys entered the 2016 season with Tony Romo, a 36-year-old quarterback who had already endured multiple back surgeries. Romo was armed with the league’s premier offensive line and a fleet of weapons, namely wide receiver Dez Bryant and rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott. Then the increasingly frail quarterback was injured in a preseason game against Seattle, and Prescott was pushed into a starting role. </p>
<p>The rookie quarterback, who came from a read-option and shotgun-based offense at Mississippi State, has proved to be a revelation. While Lynch has struggled in a limited role with Denver, his counterpart has led the Cowboys to four consecutive wins while breaking the rookie record with 155 pass attempts and zero interceptions.</p>
<p>“You can tell that the players respect the heck out of him and that he’s already a leader,” Cowboys Hall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach told ESPN. “He makes good, solid decisions. I think we’ve got a wonderful quarterback for the future.”</p>
<p>But that’s just it: The future is now.</p>
<p>Whether Dallas is a legitimate Super Bowl contender this season remains to be seen, but it’s hard to argue that this isn’t a better team with Prescott at the helm. The Cowboys aren’t just winning with Prescott ― who had actually been recruited by most SEC schools as a tight end ― but rather because of him.</p>
<p>That’s why it was such a shock when Jones said last Sunday, “Tony [Romo] is our No. 1 quarterback.”</p>
<p>Remember, too, that the 23-year-old Prescott has completed 69 percent of his passes to go along with seven touchdowns (four passing, three rushing). His staggering 83.7 total QBR is second only to that of Atlanta’s MVP candidate, veteran Matt Ryan.</p>
<p>Like Philadelphia rookie Carson Wentz ― who has also been sensational ― Prescott has displayed the rare ability to make solid pre-snap reads and not send the ball into hidden coverage.</p>
<p>“He is amazing at making decisions when ... there’s a difficult situation there and he needs to dump the ball off,” Staubach said.</p>
<p>Romo’s brilliant career is obviously what makes the decision for Jones and head coach Jason Garrett so difficult. And yet, on the “what have you done for me lately” question, the four-time Pro Bowler comes up very short. He hasn’t completed a full 16-game season since 2012, and he’s now on the wrong side of 30.</p>
<p>Prescott, for his part, has said all of the right things.</p>
<p>“This is Tony’s team,” Prescott said via the Cowboys’ official website. “I knew that going into the situation. I think everybody knew that. I’m just trying to do the best I can to give my team a chance to win week in and week out.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON ― The world’s major international sporting organizations must act to prevent human rights abuses around their marquee events, tennis great Martina Navratilova told an audience of global business executives, sporting officials and human rights organizations on Thursday. </p>
<p>Too often, Navratilova said, governing bodies like the International Olympic Committee and FIFA have failed to protect people marginalized by their events. Mega-events like the Olympics and World Cup have been plagued in recent years by human rights violations, including labor abuses in Qatar, forced evictions and police killings in Rio de Janeiro, and crackdowns on protesters, journalists, activists, and LGBT people in Russia.</p>
<p>“The principles of sport that are set out in the Olympic charter require sports governing bodies to promote and defend human rights,” Navratilova said. “If a sporting event is displacing a community without compensation, the local actors may also be to blame. But it is responsibility of the sport governing body ... to do something about it. They are the responsible party.</p>
<p>“If the construction of stadiums and mega-sporting events is subjecting workers to unsafe conditions ... it is again the responsibility of the sport governing body to do something about it,” she continued. “And if women are being systematically denied access to a sporting event or stadiums, it is again the responsibility of a governing body to do something about it.”</p>
<p>Navratilova addressed more than 120 international sports, business, political, and human rights officials ― including representatives from the IOC, FIFA, and their major corporate sponsors ― gathered at the U.S. State Department to discuss ways to improve human rights conditions surrounding mega-sporting events.</p>
<p>The conference, organized by the U.S., Switzerland, and the international think tank Institute for Human Rights and Business, stemmed from a yearlong collaboration that developed more than a dozen proposed reforms covering such issues as forced housing displacement, LGBT and gender equality, fair labor standards and workers’ rights.</p>
<p>The forum, perhaps the most ambitious effort yet to take on the landscape of mega-sporting events, comes at a crucial time. The industry is plagued not only by rampant human rights abuses, but also by corruption scandals, economic largesse, and increasing skepticism that the events aren’t worth hosting. </p>
<p>During the conference opening session, participants told how rights abuses have eroded belief in ― and begun to overshadow ― the positive ideals these sporting events are supposed to promote.</p>
<p>“The legitimacy and, dare I say, the credibility of sport has spiraled negatively downward in recent years, due to corruption, deceit, broken promises, and the adverse impact of major events on host communities and their citizens,” said David Grevemberg, CEO of the Commonwealth Games. “We have a reached a tipping point with those we serve most dearly ― people. It is a point where we can either rebuild our relevance and resonance, or swiftly become irrelevant and obsolete.”</p>
<p>“We’re a powerful force for good when we choose to be,” Grevemberg added.</p>
<p>Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland who oversaw the committee of 20 organizations that developed the initial reform proposals, said she hopes to release final versions on Dec. 10, International Human Rights Day.</p>
<p>“Some of the solutions are already out there,” John Morrison, chief executive of the Institute for Human Rights and Business, told The Huffington Post after the opening session. “Around construction, land appropriation, how you treat workers, freedom of expression. I just don’t think the world of sport knows about those issues.”</p>
<p>The hope, Morrison and Robinson said, is that sports governing bodies begin to work collectively to address problems. In the past, sporting organizations have barely collaborated, if at all, on human rights issues, so they have failed to learn from each other. Morrison was shocked to learn, for instance, that “very little” communication took place between FIFA and Rio 2016 organizers, even as they planned a World Cup and Olympics in the same country.</p>
<p>The central question is whether the world’s major international sporting organizations are ready to embrace changes. The IOC recently bolstered human rights standards in its host city contracts, and FIFA has been urged to do the same. But both organizations have made a habit of shrugging off rights violations around their events, instead blaming on local organizers and governments.</p>
<p>Anita DeFrantz, a member of the IOC’s executive board, said the organization is committed to working with this group, and expanding its human rights protections alongside other sporting organizations. (Notably, DeFrantz did not mention forced evictions, police brutality, or other issues prominent around Rio 2016, though she did note IOC-supported programs to assist women and children in Brazil.)</p>
<p>“In recent months, we have opened a new dialogue with representatives of civil society groups to address concerns that have been raised around the games,” DeFrantz said. “We are actively exploring what changes can be made before, during, and after the games. ... We will take forward the core principles laid before this conference as part of this work.”</p>
<p>The involvement of human rights, anti-corruption, and international labor groups that have criticized the current state of mega-sporting events may further bolster the process. With help from those groups, potential reforms or standards may be stronger and more focused than those FIFA and the IOC have implemented on their own. </p>
<p>“There does seem to me to be very significant buy-in,” Robinson told HuffPost. “There is, I think, a real will to provide that learning across sports, that determination that human rights and labor standards must be absolutely integrated” into these events.</p>
<p>Navratilova, too, said she believed the forum could lead to reforms that help sporting organizations promote human rights, instead of violate them. </p>
<p>“Because these events are awarded seven or 10 years ahead of time, imagine if that period was used to meaningfully improve human rights and the lives of the local population,”Navratilova said. “But too often mega-sporting events, with their long lead times, have brought high human costs for workers, for journalists, for children, for all of the local population.”</p>
<p>“These human rights standards should not only address those things that we hope to avoid or mitigate,” she said, “but also encourage the many ways a mega-sporting event can positively impact the country and its communities.”</p>

<p>The Nevada state Assembly on Friday approved legislation that will devote $750 million in public tax money to the construction of a new NFL stadium.</p>
<p>The subsidy is the largest ever for an American sports stadium.</p>
<p>The legislation will now hit the desk of Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R), who called a special session to get the vote done. He’s expected to sign the bill on Monday.</p>
<p>Sandoval has said the stadium ― which is meant to entice the NFL’s Oakland Raiders to move to Las Vegas ― will usher in a “new era for tourism” for the city.</p>
<p>There is no economic evidence, however, that NFL stadiums have such effects on local tourism, according to economists who have studied the issue. The claims Sandoval and others made about tourism “have no basis in reality,” Stanford economist Roger Noll told The Huffington Post this week.</p>
<p>Noll testified in the Nevada state Senate that the Las Vegas stadium deal was “the worst I’ve ever seen.”</p>
<p>The new stadium is backed by billionaire casino mogul and Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson, who has pledged $650 million for the project ― but only on the condition that the state approve the subsidy. Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands Corp. would operate the stadium.</p>
<p>Progressive and libertarian grassroots groups pushed back against the stadium, arguing that Nevada could soon face a $400 million budget shortfall and that education and mental health programs’ needs should be addressed instead.</p>
<p>Raiders owner Mark Davis will also contribute $500 million toward the new stadium, which has a total projected price tag of $1.9 billion.</p>
<p>The NFL has not yet approved the Raiders’ relocation to Las Vegas. NFL owners are set to discuss the issue at upcoming league-wide meetings.</p>

<p>Hoo, boy! It’s getting pretty hairy out there. The state of electoral politics is sad, and disgusting, and gross, and really deserving of the vast majority of our focus right now. But can we just take a quick break from the depressing reality we find ourselves in to appreciate Russell Westbrook?</p>
<p>The Oklahoma City Thunder guard was asked about recent comments made by his former teammate and friend Kevin Durant, who departed Oklahoma for the Golden State Warriors over the summer. Durant recently talked openly about the selflessness and camaraderie of the Bay Area team.</p>
<p>When a reporter at practice on Thursday recited Durant’s quote to Westbrook, he responded in such a perfectly Westbrookian way that it should be typed up, printed out and framed somewhere within the Chesapeake Energy Arena.</p>
<p>“That’s cute, man,” he said. “That’s cute. My job is to be able to worry about what’s going on here. We’re going to worry about all of the selfish guys we got over here, apparently.”</p>
<p>Awesome. And now, back to the awfulness that is the U.S. Presidential Election. </p>

<p>Not bad for starters.</p>
<p>Toronto Maple Leafs center Auston Matthews became the first National Hockey League player to score four goals in his first game, but it still was not enough to defeat the Ottawa Senators with Kyle Turris scoring 37 seconds into overtime to give the Senators a 5-4 victory.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty unbelievable,” Matthews said of his feat on SportsNet.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old rookie scored on his first two shots. Here’s the first one:</p>

<p>Image be damned. Chinanu Onuaku, a rookie for the Houston Rockets, flashed his childlike free throw form in a preseason game Wednesday against the New Orleans Pelicans in Beijing.</p>
<p>Video posted of Onuaku shooting underhanded understandably attracted a lot of attention.</p>
<p>Onuaku made both shots in the clip, so he must be doing something right.</p>
<p>Onuaku reportedly shot free throws so poorly his freshman college season at Louisville that he adopted the form made famous in the modern era by NBA Hall of Famer Rick Barry, who had a career free throw percentage of nearly 90 percent. Onuaku improved from about 47 percent to 59 percent his sophomore year.</p>
<p>Sure, some call the shot a “granny,” but sometimes granny knows best. </p>

<p>College football’s most prestigious individual honor is the Heisman Trophy. The award, given out since 1935, has gone to some of the greatest players ever seen ― names synonymous with greatness such as Staubach, Griffin, Dorsett, Sanders and Woodson.</p>
<p>But 2016 presents an interesting race. Already we’ve cycled through an assortment of names ― Louisville’s Lamar Jackson, Clemson’s Deshaun Watson and Ohio State’s J.T. Barrett all come to mind ― and we’re only halfway through the season. </p>
<p>But there is another quintet of exciting players gaining steam, none of whom had especially healthy odds as the year began. With that in mind, let us examine the nation’s five unexpected candidates who have deservedly become a part of the Heisman conversation.</p>
<p>Jake Browning, QB, Washington</p>
<p>Surprise, surprise? Hardly.</p>
<p>Browning has led the purple and gold back to national prominence by becoming the linchpin of Chris Petersen’s rebuilding project. The 20-year-old Folsom, California, native holds the national high school record with a whopping 229 touchdown passes, and hasn’t missed a beat since coming to Seattle.</p>
<p>Browning, a true sophomore, started all 12 games as a freshman in 2015, and this year has guided the Huskies to a 6-0 start along with a No. 5 national ranking, their best since a 2001 Rose Bowl win. Better yet, he has the always important marquee Heisman moments ― not one, but two. After destroying then-No. 7 Stanford on 15-21 passing and three touchdowns in a 44-6 win, all Browning did next was go on the road to rowdy Autzen Stadium and embarrass Oregon.</p>
<p>Just how did he do it? How about by throwing six touchdowns and running for two more in a 70-21 statement win. Better yet, it was Washington’s first victory over the Ducks in 13 tries and it also tied the Pac-12’s all-time single-game touchdown record. Moreover, Browning took the Football Bowl Subdivision lead with an astounding 23 touchdown passes (he has 26 total touchdowns) this season to go along with a nation-best 204.9 passer rating.</p>
<p>Maybe junior wide receiver John Ross III ― who’s caught nine of those touchdowns ― said it best after UW beat Stanford: “[The Stanford game] was one of his best [performances], but he still has so much to show everyone. And he’s getting better every week.”</p>
<p>Jerod Evans, QB, Virginia Tech</p>
<p>The electric Deshaun Watson and Lamar Jackson were the ACC quarterbacks we expected to be in this conversation. And both have been magnificent, particularly Jackson. But Evans, the burly 6-foot-4, 235-pound junior college transfer, has somewhat quietly led Virginia Tech to a 4-1 record, including a dominant road win over a ranked North Carolina team last weekend.</p>
<p>Evans’ numbers won’t be as gaudy as his ACC counterparts ― even Carolina’s Mitch Trubisky ― but his 15 touchdown passes to go along with just one interception speaks for itself. Credit first-year Hokies head coach Justin Fuente as well: Fuente did wonders for Paxton Lynch at Memphis, and clearly has the Midas touch with Evans. </p>
<p>Amba Etta-Tawo, WR, Syracuse</p>
<p>Despite playing for lowly Syracuse, Etta-Tawo ― a senior graduate transfer from Maryland ― has become the most dominant receiver in big-time college football, amassing 51 catches and 876 yards. And nobody could have foreseen it either: Over the course of three seasons as a Terp, Etta-Tawo caught 51 passes for 938 yards.</p>
<p>Of course, the Orange are hardly on the national radar, but the 6-foot-2, 202-pound senior wideout has performed best against top competition. Facing Louisville and Notre Dame, he combined for 237 yards and three touchdowns. Etta-Tawo, who was an unheralded three-star recruit out of Georgia, could be the first receiver to make it as a Heisman finalist since future NFL superstar Amari Cooper in 2014 (and eighth ever).</p>
<p>Jalen Hurts, QB, Alabama </p>
<p>Speaking of top-ranked Alabama, don’t sleep on explosive true freshman quarterback Jalen Hurts. The best player on the best team is usually a good Heisman formula, and while Hurts isn’t there yet, how can we ignore what he’s done?</p>
<p>After dispatching a ranked Arkansas team in Fayetteville while accumulating four touchdowns, Hurts has become a legitimate candidate for Nick Saban’s Crimson Tide. The dual-threat Texas native, who has totaled 14 TDs and just two picks, is most effective out of the spread ― an offense Saban has never previously employed ― showing maturity and elusiveness when plays break down. As his comprehension of defenses progresses, so will his ability to make winning plays. </p>
<p>D.J. Pumphrey, RB, San Diego State</p>
<p>All Pumphrey has done this year is lead the nation in rushing (891 yards) and vault into 14th all-time in college football rushing yards. Remember, too, that the next five players behind him this season have all played an additional game. In the Aztecs’ September upset of California, the senior running back went for 300 yards from scrimmage and three touchdowns.</p>
<p>Pumphrey ― who surpassed Pro Football Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk’s Aztec rushing record ― isn’t much of a pass-catcher, but his breakaway speed and shiftiness inside the tackles make him special. Should the premier back eclipse the 2,000-yard mark, he too would belong in New York City for the Heisman presentation. </p>

<p>The Nevada state senate on Tuesday approved legislation that would put $750 million in taxpayer money toward the construction of a new Las Vegas football stadium ― the first step in giving away the largest public subsidy ever for an American pro sports facility.</p>
<p>The stadium, with an overall proposed price tag of $1.9 billion, is meant to entice the NFL’s Oakland Raiders to move to the Sin City.</p>
<p>The senate approved the legislation ― which raises taxes on hotel rooms in Las Vegas to fund the stadium ― over the opposition of progressive, libertarian and conservative groups that argued the subsidy is a giveaway to billionaire casino mogul and Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, who has pledged $650 million to the project. Raiders owner Mark Davis would contribute $500 million under the current plan.</p>
<p>Now those groups have vowed to fight the legislation as it moves to the state assembly, which could vote on the stadium bill as soon as Thursday night. </p>
<p>“We’re working with Republicans and Democrats on that side to see if we can stop it,” said Bob Fulkerson, the state director of the Progressive Leadership Alliance of Nevada, or PLAN. “We’re going to get the troops rallied and get everybody there in the next couple days. The assembly is the peoples’ house. I think we can give them a good run for the money on that side.”</p>
<p>Despite good arguments against the stadium, they are up against steep odds, including Adelson and others in the casino industry, Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R), and an army of lobbyists Adelson unleashed in the state legislature this year in an attempt to push the project across the finish line. </p>
<p>Sandoval, whose political action committee has received donations from Adelson in the past, called a special legislative session to get the stadium deal done. Aside from the typical (and widely discredited) arguments about stadiums having major economic impacts, Sandoval has argued that the arrival of the Raiders will create a “new era for tourism” in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“Now is the time to capitalize on the opportunity before us to invest in Nevada’s most foundational industry, tourism, by providing for the infrastructure and public safety needs of the 21st century,” Sandoval said in a statement when he called the special session. “As I have said before, we can and must usher in a new era for tourism in the Las Vegas market, while keeping our citizens and visitors safe, and ensuring our position as the global leader in entertainment and hospitality.”</p>
<p>That argument gained even more traction in the legislature Monday, when Adelson’s fellow casino magnates and other stadium backers received “almost a full day,” Fulkerson said, to persuade senators to back the legislation.</p>
<p>“We’ve been offered a gift here,” said former Las Vegas mayor Jan Jones Blackhurst, who is now an executive at Caesars. “We’ve been offered a gift that takes us from 45 million visitors, to 55, to 65 million visitors.”</p>
<p>But there is almost no evidence the stadium or the Raiders would have that effect. The claims that stadium backers have made about tourism increases have “no basis in reality,” said Stanford economist Roger Noll, who has studied the tourism effects of stadiums and sports teams.</p>
<p>“No NFL stadium in the country generates tourism for regular season games that accounts for more than a few percent of attendance,” Noll said in an email to The Huffington Post. “And people who do travel for games typically spend minimal time – one night at most.”</p>
<p>That this is Las Vegas, a city already built on tourism, only lessens the potential impact.</p>
<p>“Because Vegas already has a lot of tourism, a tiny percentage drop in other tourism would swamp any plausible estimate of the additional tourism due to the stadium,” Noll said. </p>
<p>Groups like PLAN have raised other objections, and complained that they received comparably little time to make their case in front of state senators during an abbreviated session Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>“The fix was in to jam this through with as little public scrutiny as possible,” Fulkerson said. “They knew the more the public got to look at this, the more they would vomit all over it.”</p>
<p>Nevada, the groups argue, is already facing a potential $400 million budget deficit over the next two years. The existing hotel tax, meanwhile, is meant to help fund education, and raising it to fund the stadium could make it harder to find new revenue sources for gaps in education funding in the future. In addition, state taxpayers will be on the hook for any gaps in funding if the hotel tax fails to meet revenue projections ― a regular occurrence in stadium financing plans.</p>
<p>“We have a woefully underfunded education system. We can’t build new schools ... because we don’t have the money for it,” said Annette Magnus, the executive director of Battle Born Progress, another progressive group fighting the deal. “We haven’t properly funded our mental health system since the ‘90s. They’re going to have to balance this budget, so they’re going to have to cut critical services. But they’re willing raise a tax to build a billionaire a stadium.”</p>
<p>Nevada political observers have already predicted that the legislation will pass the state assembly during the special session. But at least on the progressive side, the groups that oppose the legislation are pulling out last-second stops in an effort to persuade Democratic assembly members to oppose the plan.</p>
<p>“We’re letting them know, there will be consequences. There will be primaries,” Fulkerson said. “The left has a chance to take out some of the people who have betrayed us.”</p>
<p>If they vote in favor of the stadium, he said, “We’re going to make sure it hurts them.”</p>

<p>On Thursday, former major league pitcher Curt Schilling announced to his 165,000 Twitter followers that he was planning on joining Fox Business for some political conversation at 2:00 p.m. ET.</p>
<p>Less than an hour later, Schilling tweeted this:</p>
<p>What in the hell could have possibly happened in the intervening 45 minutes to warrant such a follow-up? Thanks for asking! The answer is, the fervent right-winger went off the rails while talking to Fox Business’ Trish Regan about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s so-called “locker room talk.”</p>
<p>When the pair started to discuss a recently resurfaced video that clearly shows Trump in 1992 pointing out a 10-year-old girl and joking that he would be dating her in 10 years, Schilling’s defense was even more unhinged than you’d expect from a man who has been known to believe some truly shocking stuff.</p>
<p>“The conversation you’re having about the things he said about the 10-year-old girl, to me, is at the very heart of why this is a problem,” Schilling started. “How many times — and I have three boys and a daughter — how many times have you looked at a young man and said, ‘Wow, is he going to be, he’s a beautiful young man. Wow, he’s a gorgeous young man,’ and that man was 12, 13, 14, 15?”</p>
<p>A somewhat shocked Regan responded, “I’ll be honest, Curt: zero.” And then proceeded to shoot off a series of looks like this one: </p>
<p>“Now, see, that’s a lie,” Schilling responded. “There’s no way you haven’t seen someone else’s son and said, ‘Wow, he’s beautiful.’”</p>
<p>“And thought I’d going to be dating him? In 10 ― no, sorry. You’re alone on this one,” Regan said. </p>
<p>Schilling seemed to have difficulty grappling with the fact that Trump not only said the child was attractive, but also that he hoped to have a romantic relationship with her once it was legally appropriate.</p>
<p>“He’s joking about, ‘Well, when she gets older I’m going to date her.’ I mean, how do you get from there to being revolted and disgusted?” Schilling asked.</p>
<p>Once again, Regan was resolute. “I don’t look at a young boy and say, ‘In 10 years, I’m going to date him.’ I just don’t. I think that would be pretty sad if I did.”</p>
<p>At that point, Schilling’s defense really started to get weird. </p>
<p>“I have a daughter, my daughter has friends. I’ve seen my daughter’s friends, I’m a man. ‘Wow, she’s a beautiful young lady.’ I don’t immediately jump to molesting her.”</p>
<p>You get the idea. It was weird. </p>

<p>LeBron James didn’t hesitate on Tuesday when asked to explain what constitutes locker room talk in his eyes, and he didn’t even feel the need to reference Donald Trump by name while taking a shot at him in the process.</p>
<p>“What is locker room talk to me? It’s not what that guy said,” the Cleveland Cavaliers forward told reporters. “We don’t disrespect women in no shape or fashion in our locker room. That never comes up.” </p>
<p>The question was asked in reference to the Republican presidential nominee’s recent use of the term “locker room talk,” which he employed to defend jokes he made in 2005 about sexually assaulting women. Since then, professional athletes in various sports have spoken out publicly against Trump’s comments, which included a joke about grabbing women “by the p***y,” saying they did not mirror what they see in their own locker rooms. </p>
<p>“I’ve got a mother-in-law, a wife, a mom and a daughter, and those conversations just don’t go on in our locker room,” James said Tuesday. “What goes on in our locker room is sporting events that happened the night before, about family, about strategies that we may have that night, about a highlight that may have happened, you know, if there was a home run in the bottom of the ninth or there was an alley-oop dunk from a player the night before. That’s what happens in our locker room.</p>
<p>“But what that guy was saying,” James then added, “I don’t know what that is. That’s trash talk.”</p>
<p>Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.</p>

<p>Tom Brady showed zero interest in answering the media’s questions about a recently leaked recording featuring Donald Trump’s lewd comments about women.</p>
<p>“Tom, you have kids of your own,” a reporter asked the Patriots quarterback at a Wednesday press conference. “How would you respond if your kids heard Donald Trump’s version of locker room talk?”</p>
<p>Brady smiled, stated, “Thank you guys, have a good day,” and walked off-camera.</p>
<p>“Locker room talk” is how Trump has repeatedly characterized his 2005 conversation with then-“Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush, though what he actually described sounded more like sexual assault.</p>
<p>“You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful ― I just start kissing them,” Trump can be heard saying in the video. “It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything … Grab them by the pussy.”</p>
<p>Brady has called Trump a “good friend” and said in September 2015 that “it’d be great” if Trump won the election. But he walked back that endorsement just a few days later, clarifying that he wouldn’t say who would get his vote. He also noted, “I don’t know even know what the issues are” and said he didn’t pay attention to politics.</p>
<p>Though Brady has opted not to remark on Trump’s alarming comments, other professional athletes have come out to say that pretty much no one actually talks like Trump in real locker rooms.</p>

<p>Nadine Hernandez, one of the LAPD detectives investigating sexual assault allegations against New York Knicks guard Derrick Rose, died Tuesday from a gunshot wound sustained at a home in Whittier, California. </p>
<p>Hernandez, 44, was found at approximately 2:45 p.m. on Tuesday, after which she was transported to a local hospital, where she was pronounced dead. A firearm was found by police at the scene.</p>
<p>Whittier police are investigating the death as a suicide and have found “no signs of foul play” as of yet, according to the police department’s website. But Lt. Steve Dean noted that the investigation is ongoing and that the department had not entirely ruled out the possibility of homicide, according to the Los Angeles Times. </p>
<p>The Los Angeles County coroner’s office released Hernandez’s name Wednesday, and the LAPD confirmed to The Huffington Post over the phone that Hernandez worked in the police department’s Robbery-Homicide Division and was one of the investigating officers in the Derrick Rose criminal investigation.</p>
<p>Criminal charges have yet to be filed against Rose, but the former NBA MVP is in the middle of a civil trial over the allegation that he and two other men drugged and then sexually assaulted a former partner of Rose’s in August of 2013. </p>
<p>Brandon Anand, the attorney for Rose’s accuser, included a letter by Hernandez in a request last month requesting to have the name of the accuser remain anonymous during the trial. Hernandez wrote in the letter that the promise of anonymity to accuser’s was “an invaluable investigative aid to investigators as well as a great comfort to victims of crimes of such a sensitive nature.” </p>

<p>Donald Trump took a break from bashing fellow Republicans on Tuesday to praise the NBA’s San Antonio Spurs during a fundraiser in the team’s hometown.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be great if the country were run like that?” the GOP presidential nominee asked, referring to the Spurs, according to Texas Tribune reporter Patrick Svitek.</p>
<p>The Spurs, indeed, have been an ideal NBA franchise over the last two decades, winning five NBA titles and making the playoffs every season since 1997.</p>
<p>But Trump must not be much of a basketball fan. If he paid any attention to the NBA, he’d know that on the court and off, the Spurs operate in a manner completely opposite of the way he wants to run the country. And that’s not just because head coach Gregg Popovich has built a consistent winner that avoids the type of craven media attention Trump so desperately seeks.</p>
<p>The Spurs Are A Team Of Immigrants</p>
<p>The entire NBA has experienced a boom in foreign-born players in recent decades, but no franchise has capitalized on it like the Spurs. </p>
<p>The team’s championship rosters have featured stars like Argentina’s Manu Ginobli and France’s Tony Parker, and role players like Tiago Splitter (Brazil), Boris Diaw (France) and Patty Mills, the second indigenous Australian to ever play in the NBA. Nazr Mohammed, an American-born Muslim whose parents were Ghanaian immigrants, played for the Spurs’ 2005 championship team. </p>
<p>The Spurs set the record for most foreign-born NBA players on a single roster in 2012, but the title lasted just one year, because the Spurs broke it in 2013 (counting Tim Duncan, an American citizen born in the U.S. Virgin Islands).</p>
<p>In 2015, the Spurs used their second-round draft pick on Cady Lalanne, a Haitian who once lived in the U.S. as an undocumented immigrant. The team has nine foreign-born players on its 2016 roster.</p>
<p>The Spurs Have Stood Up To Anti-Immigrant Xenophobia</p>
<p>While Trump has stoked xenophobia and racism against immigrants ― especially those from Mexico ― the Spurs have pushed back against such outbursts. In 2013, the team invited Sebastien De La Cruz, an 11-year-old Mexican American, to sing the national anthem before Game 3 of the NBA Finals. </p>
<p>De La Cruz took the court in a traditional mariachi suit and delivered a rousing version of the anthem. But his performance drew racist backlash on social media, where people made fun of him with insults like, “They prolly made this Mexican sing to stay in America.”</p>
<p>Popovich blasted the “idiots” who were “proud of their ignorance.” The franchise went further: it invited De La Cruz back to sing the anthem before Game 4.</p>
<p>The Spurs Put A Woman In Charge</p>
<p>In August 2014, the Spurs made former WNBA player Becky Hammon the first woman to hold a full-time assistant coaching job in NBA history. The next summer, the Spurs made Hammon the head coach of their Las Vegas Summer League team. Hammon led them to the Summer League title, and in 2016, became the first woman to coach in the NBA All-Star Game.</p>
<p>Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly questioned whether Hillary Clinton ― the first woman to earn a major party’s presidential nomination ― has the energy or stamina to serve as president, and has lobbed repeated sexist attacks at his opponent (to say nothing of past lewd and sexist comments that are now plaguing his campaign).</p>
<p>The Spurs Backed An LGBT Rights Ordinance In San Antonio</p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly said that he would be pro-LGBT rights as president, but his record doesn’t quite back up that rhetoric. He opposes marriage equality, for instance, and selected Indiana Gov. Mike Pence ― an anti-LGBT Republican ― as his running mate.</p>
<p>The Spurs, by contrast, publicly supported a 2013 San Antonio ordinance that added sexual orientation and gender identity to city nondiscrimination laws. The ordinance passed.</p>
<p>Gregg Popovich Supported Colin Kaepernick’s Protests </p>
<p>Popovich hasn’t shied away from politics during his time as the Spurs head coach, especially in the last few years. Before this season, a reporter asked his opinion of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s decision to kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality.</p>
<p>“I absolutely understand why they’re doing what they’re doing, and I respect their courage for what they’ve done,” Popovich said. “It’s easier for white people because we haven’t lived that experience. It’s difficult for many white people to understand the day-to-day feeling that many black people have to deal with.”</p>
<p>Popovich said that Kaepernick had forced people “to face the issue,” and that he would support his players if they chose to protest.</p>
<p>Trump has told Kaepernick to “find a country that works better for him.” He has accused the Black Lives Matter movement of instigating police killings and suggested the movement should be under federal investigation.</p>
<p>Popovich, by the way, doesn’t seem to be a fan of Trump, if his mid-game reaction to learning that The Donald had won February’s New Hampshire primary is any indication:</p>
<p>Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.</p>

<p>Colin Kaepernick, the NFL quarterback whose decision to kneel during the national anthem has inspired similar protests by athletes across the sports world, will start for the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday for the first time this season, head coach Chip Kelly announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>“We need to improve on the offensive side,” Kelly reportedly said of the decision. The 49ers, who started the season 1–4 with starting quarterback Blaine Gabbert, currently rank 30th of 32 teams in passing yards, according to ESPN. </p>
<p>Kaepernick hasn’t started for the 49ers for 11 months, but he nevertheless became the center of the sports world in August when he decided to sit out the national anthem during a preseason game in August to bring light to the mistreatment of people of color in the U.S. Kaepernick has since decided to kneel instead of sit, but his protests have nonetheless led to similar protests throughout the NFL, in high schools and now in the NBA, too. </p>
<p>Kaepernick was thwarted by injuries over the summer and was occasionally bested by Gabbert during practice. Now, however, he has his shot amid negotiations with the team to restructure his contract. Kelly said that when he told Kaepernick of the coaching staff’s decision to start him on Sunday, the quarterback simply replied, “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>The team faces off against the 3–2 Buffalo Bills on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET.</p>

<p>  ZURICH/DOHA - A Bangladeshi man who says he was harshly exploited while working on 2022 World Cup facilities in Qatar is suing FIFA for allegedly failing to use its influence to ensure workers are treated fairly. The Gulf state has faced criticism of its treatment of foreign workers from Amnesty International, the Building and Wood Workers’ International organization and others. But the case announced on Monday is the first time soccer’s world governing body has been targeted. The suit, launched in FIFA’s home city Zurich with the backing of the largest labor union in the Netherlands, calls on FIFA to force Qatar to adopt “minimum labor standards” for migrant workers preparing for the tournament, including at least the right to quit a job or leave the country. Leading the Swiss suit is 21-year-old Nadim Shariful Alam, seeking around $11,500 in compensation for a deal in which he paid $4,000 to a recruiter. On arrival in Qatar, his passport was taken away and he was forced to work for 18 months under harsh conditions, according to a draft letter to be filed with Zurich’s Trade Court. He unloaded ships carrying construction materials, and paid for meals at the large workers’ camp where he was confined. He says he was then fired and deported, having earned too little to even repay the original recruitment fee. EDUCATION CAMPAIGN A Qatar government spokesman had no immediate comment. It has previously denied exploiting workers and says it is implementing labor reforms. A FIFA spokeswoman confirmed receiving a legal letter laying out the case. She saidFIFA’s “position on this matter is well-known”, pointing to plans under discussion to set up a group to monitor working conditions in Qatar. The Dutch Federation of Trade Unions (FNV) said FIFA should take responsibility, as it has the power to grant or withhold hosting deals and a history of demanding concessions from hosts. “In Qatar they’re going to allow beer, allow alcohol in the country during the World Cup. Can you imagine, in a Muslim country?” FNV lawyer Liesbeth Zegveld said. Public drinking is usually banned but will be permitted in “fanzones” during the tournament. “How difficult would it be for them to say that all companies that don’t pay adequately, that force people to remain in the country when they want to leave, will face large fines?” It is likely to be more than a year before there is a judgment in the case, she said. On Monday Qatar’s government launched a campaign to educate foreign workers about imminent reforms of its labor laws. Under the “kafala” system, foreign workers are required to seek their employer’s consent to change jobs or leave the country. From December, workers will be able to appeal to the government if they are not allowed to leave the country. Critics say workers will still find it hard to change jobs or travel. Gas-rich Qatar is pursuing a $200 billion infrastructure upgrade and has recruited hundreds of thousands of workers from countries such as India, Nepal and Bangladesh. Foreign workers outnumber the local workforce by nearly 20 to one and can be jailed or deported for forming unions or holding protests.

<p>Ruth’s Chris had more at steak than it could have imagined.</p>
<p>The steakhouse franchise in Ann Arbor, Michigan, promised customers a meal discount equivalent to the University of Michigan’s margin of victory over Rutgers in a football game on Saturday. One percentage point would be added for every point on a meal Sunday through Thursday.</p>
<p>Michigan shellacked Rutgers, 78–0, which would have given steakhouse patrons 78 percent off their meal! Well done on such a rare feat, Wolverines.</p>
<p>But the restaurant later altered its Facebook promotion copy to cap the discount at 50 percent.</p>
<p>Some say they got a raw deal.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’t make promises you don’t plan on keeping,” one fan wrote on the restaurant’s Facebook page. “Lol, not enough balls to go 78% off huh?” wrote another.</p>
<p>The restaurant said the 50 percent limit was always in place. “Our apologies the discount cap at 50% was not in this initial post,” read a message on Facebook. “This amazing promotion was launched with a cap of ‘up to 50% off’ the food portion of the bill and we’ve updated this post to reflect that.”</p>
<p>Business after the lopsided victory was still apparently brisk.</p>

<p>Harrison Browne, a forward for the National Women’s Hockey League’s Buffalo Beauts, announced Friday that he is a transgender male in an interview with ESPN.</p>
<p>The announcement makes Browne the first professional team athlete to openly identify as transgender.</p>
<p>“I identify as a man,” Browne told ESPN. “My family is starting to come to grips with it, now it’s my time to be known as who I am, to be authentic and to hear my name said right when I get a point, or see my name on a website.”</p>
<p>In a separate blog post, Browne said the announcement was timed to the start of the NWHL’s second season, which begins Friday.</p>
<p>“Beginning today ― the start of the 2016-17 National Women’s Hockey League season ― I’m making official what has been part of my life for a few years now. I’m Harrison. I’m a ‘he.’ As in ‘Harrison Browne made a good pass for the primary assist on that goal by the Beauts.’ Or ‘He really lost his check on that one,’ haha,” Browne wrote.</p>
<p>Browne, 23, told Yahoo Sports that his teammates in college ― at the University of Maine ― and in the NWHL have known about his gender identity and called him Harrison.</p>
<p>Browne also said that he notified the NWSL’s front office and commissioner Dani Rylan of his intention to come out, and received the league’s support. Browne will not legally change his name or undergo a physical transition until his hockey career is over, he said he told the league.</p>
<p>“The Commissioner immediately responded that all would be taken care of, and made it clear that the league office had my unconditional support,” Browne wrote. “That was so nice to hear.”</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, Harrison is the same player he was last year,” Rylan told ESPN. “We’re here to support him. It’s really not a big deal when you look at it, we’re respecting his name, the pronouns and his request to be his authentic self.”</p>

<p>A Houston Astros minor leaguer created a major league stink by posting a sexist tweet aimed at ESPN commentator Jessica Mendoza.</p>
<p>Brooks Marlow, who played for the team’s Single A affiliates in Quad Cities and Lancaster, California, last season, wrote Wednesday during ESPN’s broadcast of the Mets-Giants wild-card game, “no lady needs to be on espn talking during a baseball game specially Mendoza sorry.”</p>
<p>The tweet was deleted but, like baseball, the internet is forever. It was screen-grabbed.</p>
<p>In a tweeted statement the Astros noted that Marlow said he was sorry while the organization offered its own apology, calling Mendoza, who was a softball star at Stanford and an Olympic gold medalist for Team USA at the 2004 Athens Games, “an outstanding broadcaster that we have had the pleasure of working with this season.”</p>
<p>Given that Marlow hit .220 in the low minors last season, maybe the kid should work more on his hitting than on his Twitter game. </p>

<p>Since 1990, about 75 percent of teams who’ve won the first three games of an NFL season have gone on to the playoffs. </p>
<p>The 2016 version of the New York Giants appeared to be well on their way to just that ― winning at Dallas and at home versus New Orleans, only to falter late at home against Washington.</p>
<p>Of course, a 2-1 start in the NFL is admirable. But against Minnesota in primetime Monday night, the Giants lived up to criticisms that they’re soft, slow and undisciplined. </p>
<p>Take quarterback Eli Manning, for example. No quarterback, save for Chicago’s Jay Cutler, has more fumbles since 2009. Manning does have two Super Bowl wins during that span as well, so people tend to cut him more slack.</p>
<p>Then again, we are talking about a 35-year-old quarterback with zero escape ability in the pocket, prone to throwing untimely interceptions. </p>
<p>Manning tossed two picks against Washington, including one with the game hanging in the balance as the Giants marched to kick a game-winning field goal. And his second half pick against the Vikings all but sealed the hopes of a comeback. This is classic Manning and we can’t just blame the porous offensive line or conservative play-calling either. He simply doesn’t throw the ball away and he doesn’t get out of trouble.</p>
<p>He’s proven that he doesn’t need elite protection to produce quality numbers and win games. And this year he has the benefit of a shifty rookie wideout in Sterling Shepard (263 yards and 2 touchdowns) and a healthy Victor Cruz. Take into consideration that last year ― Odell Beckham Jr. amassed 1,450 yards, while the rest of Giant receivers totaled just 1,405 yards. </p>
<p>Still, this is an offense that too often fails to produce explosive plays, a significant problem that didn’t exist last year.</p>
<p>The Giants had 17 scoring plays of 20 or more yards in 2015, the third best in the league. This year, they only have one. And they’re scoring touchdowns in the red-zone a measly 46 percent of the time, per Giants.com.</p>
<p>Opposing teams are forcing New York into moving slowly up and down the field. With the Giants scoring touchdowns in the red zone just 46 percent of the time, the lack of big scoring plays has been a killer.</p>
<p>Maybe the most troubling aspect for Giants fans isn’t the struggling offense though, but a defense that ― after propelling New York’s opening couple wins ― has reverted back to its normal self. Remember, this was a unit that ranked last in total yardage allowed last season and produced that all-too-familiar Tom Coughlin scowl with its sheer inability to get off the field on 3rd-down.</p>
<p>“They’re a championship defense,” Beckham said of this year’s version following the 16-13 Week 2 Big Blue win over New Orleans.</p>
<p>Of course, Beckham has his own issues to deal with right now and the championship is a stretch.</p>
<p>New York’s most glaring issue isn’t a lack of pass rush ― $85 million man Olivier Vernon and Jason Pierre-Paul rank third and fourth in quarterback hurries ― but rather a woeful linebacking core. </p>
<p>When you don’t have backers to tackle in space (see Robinson, Keenan, and Casillas, Jonathan), corners and safeties have to cheat in, and the defense becomes susceptible to deep balls and bubble screens._</p>
<p>The result was a remarkable 45.2 percent 3rd-down conversion rate for opposing offenses ― the 28th worst clip in the league. It’s also a key reason why the Giants have a minus-eight turnover margin through four games, the third-worst in the NFL.</p>
<p>To be fair, rookie cornerback Eli Apple ― the highly touted top-10 pick out of Ohio State ― missed the Minnesota game, as did rookie safety Darian Thompson, who has played well. Pricey free agent pickup corner Janoris Jenkins has been as advertised, and the secondary is undeniably improved.</p>
<p>“We have three starting corners,” first-year head coach Ben McAdoo said recently.</p>
<p>McAdoo is also responsible for calling the Giants’ offensive plays. The former OC may be a guru, but his predictable series of screens and draws will not cut it, certainly not with the competition he’s facing in the division.</p>
<p>The NFC East may not be the sexiest division in pro football, but rookie quarterback Dak Prescott has been awfully impressive, guiding Dallas to a 3-1 start. Cousins and Washington have quietly rebounded from an 0-2, winning two straight. Meanwhile, first-year triggerman Carson Wentz has sent shockwaves throughout the NFL while racking up several records and getting the Eagles off to a 3-0 start.</p>
<p>The Giants are talented enough to stay in football games and be competitive. But being competitive and winning are two very different things. It’s a principal reason why Coughlin, despite winning two Super Bowls, was canned. It’s also the reason why GM Jerry Reese has no business being employed after assembling such a poor roster.</p>
<p>The harsh reality for the G-Men is that Manning’s window to win is shutting as those two rings under Coughlin vanish to a very distant memory. </p>

<p>Two U.S. Senators are again wading into the equal pay fight between the U.S. Women’s National Team and soccer’s American governing body, and this time they are seeking information on one of the more opaque and contentious aspects in the dispute.</p>
<p>In a Wednesday letter addressed to Don Garber, the commissioner of Major League Soccer and the chief executive of Soccer United Marketing, or SUM ― the private company that markets and sells commercial and broadcast rights for the U.S. teams ― Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) requested details about how the revenues from those marketing deals might affect the pay of USWNT and U.S. Men’s National Team players.</p>
<p>“We are interested in learning more about the amount of revenue generated by the Women’s Team and how the relative value of the Women’s Team and Men’s Team are assessed by SUM,” the senators wrote. “As the company that owns the marketing rights to the United States Soccer Federation, you are uniquely positioned to shed light on this issue.”</p>
<p>Garber and SUM didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>Murray and Feinstein have previously sought information from the U.S. Soccer Federation, which oversees both teams.</p>
<p>The equal pay dispute began in March when five USWNT players filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In the complaint, the women’s players cited public U.S. Soccer figures to claim that they had been paid 25 percent less than their male counterparts, despite generating more revenue in the most recent years and finding more success on the field.</p>
<p>U.S. Soccer has disputed those claims, saying the women earn just 2 percent less than the men. The two sides have publicly gone back and forth over the interpretation of those figures in the ensuing months.</p>
<p>The marketing deals with SUM make up a significant portion of the revenue the national teams generate each year. But because SUM bundles the commercial broadcast rights for the men’s and women’s teams as a single package, it is hard to discern the relative marketing value of either side individually. </p>
<p>For that reason, Murray and Feinstein are seeking specific breakdowns of annual revenue generated by each team over the past eight years, details of individual revenue streams that include the USWNT, and a description of SUM’s efforts to “promote the growth of women’s soccer both domestically and abroad.”</p>
<p>U.S. Soccer has said that SUM does not break down individual revenues or values for the men’s and women’s teams. It has also suggested it is safe to assume that the USMNT generates more marketing value, in large part because men’s soccer has historically done so.</p>
<p>Murray and Feinstein, however, are somewhat skeptical of that argument, noting that the final match of the 2015 Women’s World Cup ― which the USWNT won ― set national viewership records for men’s and women’s soccer broadcasts on Fox. That echoes arguments the top USWNT players have made, and both the senators and players have sought transparency on the issue of marketing revenues. </p>
<p>“This general lack of transparency ... makes it challenging to accurately understand the magnitude of the disparity in the revenue generated by the Women’s and Men’s Teams and the impact that differentials in these revenues have on the salaries of the Men’s and Women’s Team players,” the senators wrote. </p>
<p>Murray and Feinstein, two of the senate’s most ardent supporters of legislation that would promote equal pay for women workers, have repeatedly pushed U.S. Soccer on the apparent pay disparity between men’s and women’s players. Along with 20 other Senate Democrats, they introduced a resolution in May calling for equal pay for USWNT players. The nonbinding resolution unanimously passed the Senate later that month.</p>
<p>They also pressed U.S. Soccer for further details on broadcast deals and marketing rights in a similar letter sent in August, before the USWNT began play at the Rio Olympics.</p>
<p>In the latest letter, the senators reiterate that the pay dispute between the USWNT and its federation is indicative of larger problems across the country, and highlight the need to address pay discrepancies for men and women.</p>
<p>“We strongly believe that pay disparities like the one between the teams send the wrong message to young people and have no place in the 21st century economy,” they wrote.</p>

<p>The NFL has often been called the grown man’s league. Good players ― great ones, even ― see their will tested every Sunday. Mental toughness is often more important than physical ability. And in the case of Odell Beckham Jr., we are finding out exactly why.</p>
<p>In Beckham’s first two professional seasons with the New York Giants, it all came too easily. He burst onto the scene with that gravity-defying catch against archrival Dallas on “Sunday Night Football,” and went on to become a weekly one-man highlight reel for an otherwise hapless Giants team.</p>
<p>In just 12 games as a rookie, the first-round pick from LSU amassed over 1,300 yards and 12 touchdowns while earning Offensive Rookie of the Year honors. Then, last season, Beckham’s numbers improved across the board and he was recognized as a second-team All-Pro. In fact, no receiver in league history ― not even the spectacular Jerry Rice ― totaled more receiving yards through his first two seasons. Just last year, Beckham had 1,450 yards, while the rest of the Giant receivers had 1,405 combined.</p>
<p>Naturally, 2016 was supposed to be yet another one for the record books for Beckham, with the Giants drafting Sterling Shepard to help No. 13 shoulder the load.</p>
<p>At the quarter pole of the 2016 season, however, the 2-2 Giants have looked mostly anemic offensively, and Beckham has had a measly 22 catches for 303 yards and zero touchdowns ― the worst four-game stretch of his young career. He hasn’t found the end zone since Dec. 20, 2015. That’s five straight games played for Beckham without a touchdown, the longest streak of his career. In fact, prior to this stretch he had gone two games without a touchdown only once.</p>
<p>But arguably more concerning is his behavior on the field and the sidelines. Long praised for his fiery personality, the mercurial Beckham has become a distraction.</p>
<p>During a 24-10 Monday night loss to the Vikings ― a game in which he had a career-low 23 yards receiving ― he once again let his emotions get the best of him. Going back and forth with cornerback Xavier Rhodes, Beckham was hit with yet another unsportsmanlike penalty, an all too familiar pattern.</p>
<p>“Nobody on another team bothers, upsets me,” he told reporters after the game.</p>
<p>Of course, when we watch Beckham play, that hardly seems to be the case. Perhaps it all started during last year’s on-field debacle with then-Carolina Panthers All-Pro cornerback Josh Norman. Beckham was suspended for one game (thus ending the Giants’ playoff hopes) and the controversy spilled over into the offseason.</p>
<p>“He has got to be aware,” quarterback Eli Manning said. “They’re looking for him, and he has got to play smart. We can’t afford to do anything. They’re going to call him, and he brought that on himself.”</p>
<p>The hardest part when evaluating the 23-year-old Beckham is that he’s just so damn talented and passionate. You throw in his admirable work ethic, and there is no question that he can ― that he should ― go down as one of the all-time greats. </p>
<p>While we can certainly make the argument that referees aren’t treating him fairly, we must also note that he isn’t exactly giving them a choice, either.</p>
<p>There is a fine line between passion and overzealousness and Beckham has been toeing it all year. He talked incessantly about how “it is what it is” following Monday’s game. The harsh reality, though, is that “it is what it is” only because of Beckham’s petulant actions.</p>
<p>“I just have to understand if I sneeze the wrong way, it’ll be a flag, it’ll be a fine,” Beckham said. “If I tie my shoe the wrong way, it might be a fine or a flag.”</p>
<p>At their core, these statements sound like denial and stupidity from a player widely recognized as a thoughtful and brilliant young man. Surely, Monday night will not be the last time players attempt to throw Beckham off by baiting him and trying to get him thinking about anything but football. And surely the referees will keep an eye out for any little misstep he might make. </p>
<p>Beckham needs to understand that he’s too talented and too valuable to continually fall into this trap: Causing brawls, as he did against the Rams in 2014. Fighting kicking nets, as he did last week. Getting suspended with the season hanging in the balance.</p>
<p>Go back and look at the recent history of the truly great wide receivers in this league. Plenty of them were known hotheads with questionable on-field antics ― think Randy Moss, Michael Irvin, Terrell Owens ― and yet for the most part they were able to put aside the emotional outbursts and play great football. </p>
<p>It’s time for Beckham to take accountability and turn this thing around before it spirals completely out of control.</p>

<p>With Odell Beckham Jr. in the house, a ball boy did an excellent impersonation of the New York Giants receiver on Monday night at U.S. Bank Stadium.</p>
<p>In a game against the visiting Giants, Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Bradford threw a pass out of bounds. The ball boy, whose left hand was already full, casually snared the pass with his right hand raised over his head.</p>
<p>The catch was reminiscent of the career-defining one-hander Beckham made against the Cowboys in November 2014. (On Monday, however, Beckham made just three catches for 23 yards in the Giants’ 24-10 loss and was penalized for taunting.)</p>
<p>If an NFL team can’t sign the ball boy to play, we think his title should be elevated at the very least.</p>
<p>How about ball emperor?</p>

<p>UPDATE 3:25 p.m. ― The Baltimore Sun reported Tuesday afternoon that Joseph Bauer had showed signs of improvement, giving doctors a thumbs up at their request. “We have been encouraged by some signs we believe indicate he recognizes his wife,” his sister told the Sun.</p>
<p>PREVIOUSLY:</p>
<p>Joseph Bauer, a 55-year-old Baltimore Ravens fan, remained “unresponsive” Monday after a stadium fight in Baltimore Sunday with two Oakland Raiders supporters, according to reports. The two suspects, Scott Smith, 30, of Mount Vernon, New York, and Andrew Nappi, 31, of Eastchester, New York, were charged with first- and second-degree assault and released on bond.</p>
<p>Bauer, a former Marine from the Baltimore suburb of Jessup, has been unconscious since the incident during the Ravens-Raiders game at M&T Bank Stadium.</p>
<p>“We’re clinging to hope,” Susan Bauer, his sister, told the Baltimore Sun. “He’s still not responsive and not awake, and we don’t know the extent of his brain damage. The doctors said it was consistent with a major stroke.”</p>
<p>According to a police report cited by the Sun, Nappi said an argument started, then Bauer threw a bottle at Smith’s head and Nappi punched Bauer in the face. Bauer’s wife, Sharon, said Smith pushed her husband to the ground where he hit his head. </p>
<p>“Two individuals had become involved in a verbal altercation with our victim,” Lt. Jarron Jackson of Baltimore Police Department said in a CBS Baltimore news segment. “That verbal altercation became physical. And at some point, the victim was pushed on the ground where he struck his head.” </p>
<p>CBS reported that the encounter may have been the result of a good deed by Bauer. His sister told the station that he let someone cut in line at a concession stand, which sparked an argument with the two suspects.</p>
<p>“Here’s a man and a family that have been longtime season ticket holders, that know the people here that work in the building, that love the Ravens and have been to countless numbers of games at M&T Bank Stadium without incident,” Harbaugh said. “Then all of a sudden, there’s an incident where a gentleman is assaulted by somebody. That’s just not what we’re about. We’re a family. It’s a family atmosphere.”</p>

<p>Watch your hips, Antonio Brown. The NFL certainly is.</p>
<p>The so-called No Fun League continues to be a buzzkill on the Pittsburgh Steelers receiver’s touchdown celebrations.</p>
<p>Brown was penalized for twerking a few weeks ago and suggested he would tone down the end zone partying in accordance with the “two-pump rule” jokingly established by a “Key & Peele” comedy sketch.</p>
<p>So when Brown scored a second touchdown Sunday night in a 43–14 home victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, he merely thrust his hips twice.</p>
<p>But the referees weren’t laughing. They flagged Brown for excessive celebration again.</p>

<p>CHASKA, Minnesota (Reuters) - Ryan Moore clinched a thrilling U.S. Ryder Cup triumph over Europe on Sunday at Hazeltine National, beating Lee Westwood to end a long U.S. wait to reclaim the golden trophy in golf’s greatest team competition.</p>
<p>With Westwood in for bogey at the 18th, Moore rolled his birdie putt to within one foot and the tap-in was conceded to seal a 1-up win and clinch a 15-10 lead for the United States.</p>
<p>Team mates, families and friends poured out onto the green to celebrate.</p>
<p>The Americans had last won the biennial match play event in 2008 as Europe ran off three Cup victories in a row, extending their domination to eight of the last 10 meetings.</p>
<p>Brandt Snedeker had set Moore up for the winning point by claiming a 3 and 1 victory over English rookie Andy Sullivan at the 17th hole.</p>
<p>On a brilliantly sunny, warm day, the U.S. side capitalized on their greater depth to close out victory after some titanic early matches in which Europe had closed the gap to one point after entering the deciding 12 singles matches trailing by three.</p>

<p>LONDON (Reuters) - Scottish boxer Mike Towell has died in hospital after the 25-year-old suffered serious injuries in a welterweight bout in Glasgow on Thursday.</p>
<p>Towell was knocked down in the opening round of his bout by Welshman Dale Evans and referee Victor Loughlin eventually stopped the contest in the fifth. The Dundee fighter received treatment in the ring before being taken to hospital.</p>
<p>St Andrews Sporting Club, which organized the fight, said early on Saturday that Towell had died.</p>
<p>”Within the last hour Mike Towell passed away - he will always be in our hearts #RIPIronMike,” it said on Twitter.</p>
<p>After the fight, Evans released a statement saying he was “devastated” to see Towell being taken from the ring on a stretcher.</p>
<p>“The aftermath of the fight is so hard to take in but I just want people to know that every thought I have today is with Mike Towell’s family,” he said.</p>

<p>The Atlantic Coast Conference football championship game will be held in Orlando on Dec. 3, after conference officials decided to pull out of North Carolina because of the state’s new law that discriminates against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. </p>
<p>The law, known as HB2, bars cities and localities from enacting anti-discrimination policies that protect people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. It also prevents schools from allowing transgender students to use the restroom that correspondents with their gender identity, rather than the gender on their birth certificate.</p>
<p>North Carolina has had a steady stream of bad press and businesses leaving the state since Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed HB2 into law in March. </p>
<p>The ACC championship game was originally supposed to be held in Charlotte. But this month, officials put out a statement saying it would be moved. </p>
<p>“Every one of our 15 universities is strongly committed to these values and therefore, we will continue to host ACC championships at campus sites,” the ACC statement said. “We believe North Carolina House Bill 2 is inconsistent with these values, and as a result, we will relocate all neutral-site championships for the 2016-17 academic year.”</p>
<p>Florida does not have a law that provides protections on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Orlando, however, has a human rights ordinance that does include those categories. </p>
<p>The Orlando Sentinel reports that local community leaders received a questionnaire from the ACC “inquiring about the inclusiveness of the area, working to confirm legislation and ordinances were in place that would prevent a situation similar to the North Carolina controversy.”</p>
<p>Charlotte actually did have LGBT protections at one point ― which is what set off the backlash from Republicans. The city council passed a nondiscrimination ordinance in February, leading to state officials pushing HB2 in order to overturn it. </p>

<p>Cleveland Browns wide receiver Josh Gordon will put his football career on hold after the team announced Thursday that Gordon will enter an in-patient rehabilitation facility.</p>
<p>Gordon, who was suspended for the first four games in 2016, was scheduled to play his first game since 2014 on Oct. 9, but instead he is out indefinitely.</p>
<p>“After careful thought and deep consideration I’ve decided that I need to step away from pursuing my return to the Browns and my football career to enter an in-patient rehabilitation facility,” Gordon said in a statement. “This is the right decision for me and one that I hope will enable me to gain full control of my life and continue on a path to reach my full potential as a person. I appreciate the support of the NFL, NFLPA, the Browns, my teammates, my agent and the community through this extremely challenging process.”</p>
<p>Gordon was suspended in March after his latest failed drug test. He was reinstated in July. </p>
<p>Suspensions for violating the league’s substance abuse policy have caused Gordon to miss 30 of the Brown’s 35 games.</p>
</doc><doc id="933" filename="SPORTS" url="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/losing-nfl-teams-primed-for-turnarounds_us_57ed56ade4b082aad9b9ef48" headline="These Losing NFL Teams Are Primed For Winning Turnarounds" date="2016-09-29" authors="Jordan Schultz">
<p>When you start the season 1-2, you can either panic or regroup. It’s hardly ideal, but there really isn’t much else to do. Thirteen NFL teams are entering Week 4 in exactly that position, and three are talented and mature enough to dig themselves out of such a hole.</p>
<p>Let’s look more closely at those three.</p>
<p>Cincinnati Bengals</p>
<p>After last season’s magical 8-0 start, the Bengals stumbled into the playoffs before losing a heartbreaking home game to Pittsburgh. This season, meanwhile, has started rather ominously, after Marvin Lewis and company squandered a fourth quarter home lead to Trevor Siemian. Yes, this Trevor Siemian.</p>
<p>But help is on the way ― likely in Week 5 ― and it comes in the form of tight end Tyler Eifert, a matchup nightmare who hauled in 13 touchdowns last year despite catching just 52 balls ― the best catch-to-touchdown ratio in the league. Eifert, nursing an ankle injury, is arguably the most important player on the Cincy offense. With respect to All-Pro wide receiver A.J. Green, Eifert’s ability to run seam routes and create doubles inside the 20s helped quarterback Andy Dalton enjoy one of his most efficient professional seasons in 2015. And it’s no coincidence that sans Eifert, Dalton has just one touchdown pass to a wide receiver through three games this season.</p>
<p>Carolina Panthers</p>
<p>Carolina’s Week 1 loss in Denver should be excused, but it’s hard to overlook a Week 3 home debacle against Minnesota. The 22-10 loss snapped their 14-game home winning streak. Remember, this is a team that lost just one regular season game all of last year.</p>
<p>Go back and watch the tape: The Panthers ― arguably pro football’s most physical team ― were completely out-worked and out-muscled by Minnesota. Cam Newton never found his rhythm and was clearly missing injured running back Jonathan Stewart, particularly in the pass game. His replacement, the second-year man Cameron Artis-Payne, could only muster 47 yards on 12 carries.</p>
<p>Naturally, Newton makes everyone look better ― see Ted Ginn Jr. ― and he’s so special with his legs that a lack of protection often gets overlooked. But not against Minnesota and not while his most dangerous target went invisible. The involvement of wideout Kelvin Benjamin ― held catchless against the resurgent Vikings ― might just be the key factor to the Panthers’ offense getting back on track. Despite missing all of 2015 with a torn ACL, the 6-foot-5, 245 pound Benjamin amassed 13 catches for 199 yards and 3 touchdowns.</p>
<p>“That can’t happen. That can’t happen,” Newton said. “And if I’m speaking for it, that won’t happen again.” When Newton proclaims something ― anything really ― he tends to back it up. And we should believe him. Even at 1-2, Carolina remains in great shape to win the NFC South and have the opportunity to reach a second consecutive Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Arizona Cardinals</p>
<p>Arizona has perhaps been the biggest disappointment through three weeks, even more so than Carolina. To go on the road against a reeling Buffalo team and not just lose, but get embarrassed, 33-18, is completely uncharacteristic of a Bruce Arians team.</p>
<p>Arians is a head coach known for preparation and his team typically reflects it. But so far, both his offense and defense have been underwhelming. Quarterback Carson Palmer’s four interceptions (and a 13.4 quarterback rating) are a rarity though, and between David Johnson, Larry Fitzgerald, John Brown and Michael Floyd, there are simply too many weapons for Palmer not to right the ship.</p>
<p>The defense, however, remains a concern. Unable to create third-and-longs ― mostly because of its inability to stop the run ― Arizona has allowed opponents to convert 45.2 percent of their third downs, tied with lowly Indianapolis for fifth-worst in the league. Just as bad, though, is a Cardinals defense ranked 28th in rushing defense, an area in which it excelled last year when it ranked sixth. The danger here is the temptation to start bringing its safeties into the box, especially on first and second down. And when they do that, their defense naturally becomes susceptible to play-action and the deep ball.</p>
<p>Part of the blame ― on both sides of the ball and in special teams ― can be attributed to the Cards’ youth movement. But the 63-year-old Arians has earned the benefit of the doubt. That’s what happens when you turn one of the NFL’s struggling franchises into Super Bowl contenders practically overnight.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a lot of young guys,” Arians said. “We have some new faces that are doing their own thing and not following the example set by these guys. And it’s a two-way street. They can only lead you to water, but you’ve got to drink it. And some of these young guys have got to get out of old habits and get in with the Cardinal Way.”</p>

<p> The best kind of heckler ― if such a thing exists ― is one who knows how to step up his game when challenged.  </p>
<p>A group of pro golfers learned that the hard way on Thursday, during a practice round at the Ryder Cup. As Rory McIlroy and Andy Sullivan tried ― and failed repeatedly ― to sink a putt, a fan in the crowd shouted out that he could easily make the 12-foot shot.</p>
<p>It was time for a challenge.</p>
<p>Swedish golfer Henrik Stenson pulled the heckler, David Johnson from North Dakota, from the gallery and placed him front and center, while pro golfer Justin Rose pulled out a fresh $100 bill. Stenson handed Johnson a putter.</p>
<p>The crowd laughed as the amateur opponent calculated his angles and assumed his putting stance. Then, with a few adjustments and a firm tap, Johnson sunk the ball. </p>
<p>After accepting his well-earned $100 from Rose, Johnson met with reporters to talk about his epic shot and new golfing rivals.</p>
<p>“I razzed them a little bit and they heard me, which was insane,” Johnson told the crowd. “I was going to make it, I knew that.”</p>
<p>So, how did a heckler in the crowd manage to sink a shot that two champion golfers simply couldn’t?</p>
<p>“I closed my eyes, swallowed my puke and hit the putt,” Johnson said. “It happened to go in.” </p>

<p>Week 3 of the NFL season ― the last before the first string of byes ― is known as a defining week of football. Contenders and pretenders become far more evident, and hot quarterback play often halts with road tests. Week 3 of the 2016 season only reaffirmed this.</p>
<p>Here are the three most important things we learned.</p>
<p>The Eagles Are For Real </p>
<p>This shouldn’t have been much of a question mark, but after completely dominating Pittsburgh in a 34-3 rout, we can confidently call the undefeated Eagles the real deal. As we examined last week, it all starts with 23-year-old rookie quarterback Carson Wentz, who has yet to commit a single turnover while amassing a 103.8 quarterback rating ― seventh best in the league ― along with five touchdown passes. Wentz has developed an instant connection with young receivers Jordan Matthews (204 yards, 2 touchdowns) and Nelson Agholor, both of whom struggled immensely in 2015 with Sam Bradford under center. And Wentz has been buoyed by a surprising Philly defense.</p>
<p>After shutting down Cleveland and Chicago, the Eagles’ defense showed real promise Sunday by holding the red hot Steelers offense to three points on 251 yards. Ben Roethlisberger, meanwhile, threw for a season low in yardage and was held without a touchdown pass. In fact, through three games, Philly has allowed just 27 points. In other words, get used to hearing a lot more “Fly Eagles Fly” and “Wentzylvania.”</p>
<p>Trevor Siemian Is More Than Just A Game Manager</p>
<p>Siemian, drafted in the seventh round last year before nearly retiring to pursue a real estate career, is still undefeated after going on the road to Cincinnati and beating one of the league’s better defenses. And in doing so, he became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for 300 yards and 4 touchdowns in a road debut. To put that number in perspective, consider that his boss ― John Elway ― only did it six times throughout his Hall of Fame career.</p>
<p>This stuff just doesn’t happen ― not in this league, not with that lack of pedigree, and certainly not this early on in a career. But Siemian ― playing for just above the league minimum at $525,000 ― defied logic Sunday, when he led Denver to a fourth-quarter comeback, which included a gorgeous deep ball to Demaryius Thomas that iced the game. His perfect 158.3 fourth quarter QBR says it all. Not unlike Wentz, Siemian ― attempting to guide the Broncos to a second consecutive world championship ― displayed an uncanny ability to audible out of bad plays, only to find the correct play. “He didn’t just play. He played big in the game today,” Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak said.</p>
<p>The Pats Are Really Good</p>
<p>Surprise, surprise. After Jimmy Garappolo tried his best Tom Brady imitation, rookie third-rounder Jacoby Brissett performed admirably against a Houston defense we thought was pretty good. The bigger story here though, is New England’s rare ability to game plan and scheme regardless of who’s under center. With Brady set to return in Week 5, the Patriots will only get that much better, particularly with a defense that has allowed a mere six red-zone trips in three games, according to ESPN.com.</p>
<p>Credit defensive coordinator Matt Patricia, along with Jamie Collins ― a longtime favorite of mine ― who might just be the premier linebacker in pro football. We must not forget about cornerback Malcolm Butler, who has undoubtedly become one of the elite cover guys around. It’s simply a formality that Bill Belichick and company will march onto an eighth consecutive AFC East title, and 14th in 15 seasons. </p>

<p>College athletes are employees who should be paid wages, a former University of Southern California football player asserts in a lawsuit filed against the NCAA and the PAC‑12 Conference this week.</p>
<p>Lamar Dawson, who played linebacker at USC from 2011 to 2015, filed the proposed class-action suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on Monday.</p>
<p>The lawsuit differs from other high-profile cases against the NCAA, which have alleged that the governing organization for college sports has violated antitrust law by placing artificial caps on the amount of money athletes can receive.</p>
<p>This suit, by contrast, contends that athletes meet the definition of “employees” under both federal and California state wage and hour laws, and that the NCAA and PAC-12 violated those laws by not properly compensating them for work and overtime. Players, it says, were required to work more than eight hours a day and 40 hours a week without adequate compensation, and the suit seeks unpaid wages, overtime pay and damages.</p>
<p>At USC, Dawson was “repeatedly paid a substandard wage insofar as he was denied full pay for all hours worked, including overtime pay, and was frequently permitted to work without receiving required minimum wage payments,” according to the suit. </p>
<p>Both the PAC-12 and NCAA said they disagreed with the claim.</p>
<p>“We are currently evaluating the claim, but strongly disagree with the notion that college students participating in athletics are employees,” NCAA chief legal officer Donald Remy said in an email statement. “Our experience is that these college students, like their non-athlete colleagues, are very focused on their academic endeavors. Moreover, they have a passion for their sport and a commitment to their teammates that can’t be equated to punching a time clock.”</p>
<p>“We have conducted an initial review of the complaint and will vigorously defend ourselves,” a PAC-12 spokesperson said. “As has been made clear through the legal process, student-athletes are not employees.”</p>
<p>The suit’s claim rests on the argument that under NCAA and conference rules, school athletic programs exert enough control over athletes to qualify them as employees under federal and state labor law. That argument is similar to the one Northwestern University football players made when they attempted in 2014 to create the first players union for college athletes ― however, those players made no mention of wages.</p>
<p>The Chicago regional chapter of the National Labor Relations Board agreed that the Northwestern athletes met the definition of “employee” under federal labor law. The full NLRB, however, invalidated that ruling when it declined last year to assert its jurisdiction in the case.</p>
<p>In February, a federal court in Indiana dismissed a suit filed by track and field athletes at the University of Pennsylvania that was similar to Dawson’s. The athletes have appealed the ruling.</p>
<p>Mark C. Rifkin, one of Dawson’s attorneys, believes the new case is stronger because it involves college football players.</p>
<p>“I think there’s something special about players in the big-revenue, big-money sports like [major conference] football,” Rifkin said. “It’s just different. All athletes make great sacrifices, and they all make great contributions, but players who play in big-time, big-revenue sports really stand in a different position. It’s a totally different relationship between the conference and the player and the NCAA and the player.”</p>
<p>The NCAA is currently facing at least two other major legal challenges over compensation for college athletes. A class-action antitrust suit originally brought by former UCLA basketball star Ed O’Bannon could soon end up in front of the Supreme Court; in August, a federal judge rejected the NCAA’s efforts to dismiss another antitrust case headed by prominent labor attorney Jeffrey Kessler.</p>
<p>Rifkin’s case differs from those, but he said it takes on the same basic idea.</p>
<p>“These are all part of a sort of growing trend toward recognizing student-athletes as participants in a major business venture, and treating them fairly given their role in that business,” Rifkin said.</p>

<p>With his once-promising football career behind him, former quarterback Tim Tebow had tongues wagging with the announcement that he’d give professional baseball a try.</p>
<p>Skeptics thought his greatest accomplishment on the field would be his jumping memes — but after signing a minor league contract with the New York Mets, Tebow was able to put his money where his bat is. </p>
<p>ESPN writer Adam Rubin reports that during his first at-bat in an instructional league game, Tebow swung at the first ball — and hit it out of the park. West Palm Beach, Florida, journalist Katie Johnson captured the moment on Twitter, as seen in the video above.</p>
<p>Tebow homered off a pitch from John Kilichowski, a player from Vanderbilt University who was selected by the St. Louis Cardinals in the 11th round of June’s draft. USA Today pointed out that the 22-year-old pitcher was just 12 when Tebow led the University of Florida to one of two national championships ... in football, remember. </p>
<p>Even without the home run, some fans watching in Florida probably were just excited to see him at all. </p>

<p>In the Miami Marlins’ first game since star pitcher Jose Fernandez was killed in a weekend boating accident, second baseman Dee Gordon stepped up to the plate wearing his fallen teammate’s jersey and crushed a lead-off home run ― his first of the season.</p>
<p>Tears streamed down Gordon’s face as he rounded the bases. As he crossed home plate, Gordon gestured to the sky before returning to the dugout, where his teammates ― each wearing Fernandez’s now-retired No. 16 jersey ― came to comfort him.</p>
<p>The emotional scene inside Marlins Park could not have been scripted more perfectly. </p>
<p>In a tribute to his teammate, Gordon, a lefty batter, stepped to the plate batting right and wearing Fernandez’s batting helmet. After taking the first pitch, Gordon swapped the helmet for his own, and switched to the left-handed batters’ box. With a 2-0 count, Gordon homered to right field to give the Marlins the early 1-0 lead. </p>
<p>“Unbelievable,” a game announcer said after Gordon’s at-bat. “Just unbelievable ― his eyes wet with emotion as he rounded the bases, his first home run of the season.” </p>
<p>Fernandez, 24, and two others were killed in a boating accident early Sunday in south Florida. In a statement confirming Fernandez’s death, the Marlins announced the team had canceled Sunday’s home game against the Atlanta Braves. </p>
<p>“Sadly, the brightest lights are often the ones that extinguish the fastest,” Marlins owner Jeffrey H. Loria said in a statement. “José left us far too soon, but his memory will endure in all of us.”</p>
<p>Monday’s game against the New York Mets was the Marlins first since Fernandez’s death. After four innings, the Marlins led the Mets 7-0.</p>

<p>A bag containing Jose Fernandez’s checkbook and four baseballs autographed by the star Miami Marlins pitcher washed ashore Monday at Miami Beach about a mile from where he and two others were killed in a boating accident the previous day, according to WSVN 7 News. </p>
<p>The find was no doubt an eerie and heartbreaking reminder of a tragedy that has shocked the city of Miami and the Major League Baseball community.</p>
<p>The bag was reportedly discovered by a beachgoer and turned into a lifeguard tower at 24th street, about a mile north of where the 24-year-old pitcher and two friends were killed after their 32-foot boat hit rocks and capsized. Miami Beach Ocean Rescue Division Chief Vincent Canosa told WSVN 7 News the items appeared to belong to one of the deceased.</p>
<p>Fernandez and his friends Emilio Jesus Macias, 27, and Eduardo Rivero, 25, were killed early Sunday morning when a 32-foot SeaVee boat, owned by Fernandez, plowed at high speed into a jetty at the entrance of Miami Harbor, the Miami Herald reported. The crash remains under investigation and authorities have said they do not believe alcohol or drugs were a factor.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Herald reported that Fernandez had been seen at a Miami bar earlier in the night and may have been upset about an argument with his girlfriend.</p>
<p>The Marlins took the field Monday evening for its first game since the ace pitcher was killed. As a tribute, every player wore a Fernandez jersey and team owner Jeffrey Loria announced the team will retire Fernandez’s number 16. </p>
<p>In a bit of magic that could not have been scripted more perfectly, Marlins second baseman Dee Gordon stepped up to the plate Monday wearing his fallen teammate’s jersey and crushed a lead-off home run ― his first of the season ― to give his team an early 1-0 lead.</p>
<p>The Marlins went on to beat the New York Mets 7-3.</p>

<p>LeBron James won’t join San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick in kneeling during the national anthem before NBA games, the Cleveland Cavaliers star said Monday at the team’s first media session of the season. But James did speak out against recent police killings that have amplified Kaepernick’s protests, saying that they have created a “scary-ass situation” for those who, like him, are parents of young black children.</p>
<p>“My personal feelings is that I got a 12-year-old son, a 9-year-old son, a 2-year-old daughter, and I look at my son being four years removed from being able to drive his own car, being able to leave the house on his own,” James said. “It’s a scary thought right now to think, if my son gets pulled over, and you tell your kids, if you just comply, if you just listen to the police that they’ll be respectful and things will work itself out.”</p>
<p>“And you see these videos that continue to come out,” he continued. “It’s a scary-ass situation ― that if my son calls me and says he’s been pulled over, that I’m not that confident that things are going to go well and my son is going to return home.”</p>
<p>Watch James’ comments on police brutality:</p>
<p>James and fellow NBA stars Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade took the stage before the ESPY Awards in July to speak out against police violence. James said Monday that while he plans to stand for the national anthem, he is happy Kaepernick and other NFL players who have joined the protests have continued pushing the conversation.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the answer, none of us have the answer,” James said. “But the more times that we can talk about it, the more times we can conversate about it. Because I’m not up here saying that all police are bad, because they’re not. I’m not up here saying all kids are great and all adults are great, because they’re not.”</p>
<p>“But at the same time, all lives do matter,” he said. “It’s not black or white, it’s not that. It’s everybody. But it’s tough being a parent right now, when you have a pre-teen. But the conversation has continued from the ESPYs speech that myself, CP, D-Wade and Melo had, and that’s definitely a good thing.”</p>
<p>James has spoken out against police killings of African-Americans in the past, too. He was among the NBA players to wear “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirts during warm-ups in 2014, after a New York police officer killed Eric Garner in Staten Island. James posted images referencing the police shooting death of Ferguson, Missouri, teenager Michael Brown in 2014, and he, Wade and their then-Miami Heat teammates, posed in hoodies after the killing of unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012.</p>
<p>The NBA and its players’ union said in a statement last week that they anticipated players would bring Kaepernick’s protest to the basketball court, and other NBA players and coaches spoke out about the issue during media sessions on Monday.</p>
<p>Toronto Raptors guard Kyle Lowry struck a similar tone as James, saying the killings made him nervous to be a parent.</p>
<p>“Me having two younger black kids, making sure people are aware that me growing up, definitely getting pulled over was a scary thing, and definitely was a nervous thing,” Lowry said, the Toronto Star reported. “I think now we have to use our voices.”</p>
<p>Lowry’s teammate DeMar DeRozan said he will likely protest.</p>
<p> “I had a close friend of mine a couple of weeks ago who was murdered by the police, shot 17 times,” DeRozan said, via the Star. “It was something I haven’t spoke out about. It was more so of just understanding what’s going on in our society and how much I can help. And that’s what it’s all about. So most definitely I think we will, and I will (protest), for sure.” </p>
<p>Stephen Curry, who has backed Kaepernick’s protests, reiterated that stance while saying he would stand for the anthem before Golden State Warriors games this season. </p>
<p>At the Knicks media day, Anthony said his team would act collectively to address police brutality. John Wall similarly said his Washington Wizards would “talk as a team, as a group, and figure out what we want to do.”</p>
<p>San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, meanwhile, said he would respect any of his players’ decision to protest during the anthem if they chose to.</p>
<p>“My players are engaged citizens who are fully capable of understanding what their values are, and what they think is appropriate and inappropriate, and what they feel strongly about,” Popovich said. “Whatever actions may or may not be taken are their decisions, and I’m not going to tell anyone ahead of time that if they don’t do A, B and C, they’re going to be gone or traded. I think that’s ignorant.”</p>
<p>Los Angeles Lakers guard Nick Young has previously said that he has considered kneeling during the anthem once the season begins. </p>

<p>Here’s an aggressive game plan for all the soccer fans.</p>
<p>It took the University of Mary Marauders all of three seconds to get on the scoreboard Sunday, thanks to a record-setting boot from senior forward Megan Searson.</p>
<p>With a little help from the reported 33 mph winds at her back, Searson sent a 54-yard strike soaring over the goalkeeper and into the Minnesota Crookston net.</p>
<p>The University of Mary tweeted that the goal set the record for the fastest goal across all levels of competition in NCAA soccer history.</p>
<p>The Marauders won the match 2-0. </p>

<p>Arnold Palmer, who was considered one of the best golf players of all time, died Sunday in Pittsburgh, according to reports. He was 87. </p>
<p> Over his decades-long career, Palmer recorded 62 PGA tour victories and seven major titles ― including four wins at the Masters. He was the first professional golfer to make over $1 million by playing the game. </p>
<p>Palmer, who earned himself the nickname “The King,” was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004, and in 2012 was recognized with a Congressional Gold Medal for his work on and off the golf course.</p>
<p>Palmer’s prowess and athleticism made him golf’s first true star, and he helped usher the sport into the mainstream.</p>
<p>“Arnold transcended the game of golf,” Palmer’s friend and former rival Jack Nicklaus said Sunday night in a statement. “He was more than a golfer or even great golfer. He was an icon. He was a legend. Arnold was someone who was a pioneer in his sport. He took the game from one level to a higher level, virtually by himself.”</p>
<p>Palmer was born in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, on Sept. 10, 1929. His father, a course groundskeeper, introduced him to golf at the age of 3. Palmer went on to earn a scholarship to play golf for Wake Forest University; he made the jump to play the game professionally in 1954, after serving in the Coast Guard.</p>
<p>With great talent and golden character, Palmer was quickly endeared to fans and competitors. Known for his powerful swing, he brought drama and style to golf, which helped the game win its place among televised sports.</p>
<p>“Palmer on a golf course was Jack Dempsey with his man on the ropes, Henry Aaron with a three-and-two fastball, Rod Laver at set point, Joe Montana with a minute to play, A.J. Foyt with a lap to go and a car to catch,” Los Angeles Times columnist Jim Murray wrote in 1991. </p>
<p>Companies also took a liking to Palmer, and he became one of the first professional golf players to capitalize on endorsements. He licensed his signature drink, iced tea mixed with lemonade, to Arizona Tea Co. in 2002. It’s now bottled and sold as “Arnold Palmer Tee.”</p>
<p>Philanthropy replaced competition after Palmer retired in 2006. He created an endowment at Wake Forest and founded the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies in Orlando, Florida, which he named for his first wife after she died.</p>
<p>Palmer is survived by his wife, Kathleen Gawthrop, whom he married in 2005, and two daughters. </p>
<p>Late Sunday, President Barack Obama posted a tribute to “The King” on Twitter:</p>

<p>Miami Marlins pitcher Jose Fernandez was killed in a boating crash early Sunday morning in south Florida, the Miami Herald reports. </p>
<p>In a statement confirming Fernandez’s death, the Major League Baseball team also announced it has canceled Sunday’s home game against the Atlanta Braves.</p>
<p>“The Miami Marlins organization is devastated by the tragic loss of José Fernández,” the statement read. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this very difficult time.”</p>
<p>The 24-year-old pitcher was boating with two friends off Miami Beach when their 32-foot boat hit rocks and capsized, NBC Miami reported.</p>
<p>Divers recovered three bodies at the scene following a 3:40 a.m. call, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue said in a release.</p>
<p>Speed appears to have been a factor. There was no evidence of alcohol or illegal substances found, a spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission told the station.</p>
<p>Fernandez was drafted by the Marlins in 2011, and played his first MLB game in 2013. </p>
<p>He went on to became the youngest Cuban-born player to make an All-Star debut, the Herald reported at the time. He won the National League Rookie of the Month Award in both July and August 2013, as well as the Rookie of the Year Award.</p>
<p>Marlins manager Don Mattingly broke down in tears at a press conference Sunday afternoon as he reflected on Fernandez’s passion for baseball.</p>
<p>““The way he played, there’s just joy with him when he played,” he said. “And when he pitched, and I think that’s what the guys will say too. As mad as he would make you with some of the stuff he would do, you just see that little kid that you see when you watch kids play Little League or something like that. That’s the joy that Jose played with and the passion he felt about playing, that’s what I think about.”</p>
<p>Fernandez successfully defected to the U.S. with his mother when he was 15. He had tried to do so three times previously, and was jailed each time for treason, CBS Sports reported. During their fourth and final attempt to leave Cuba, his mother fell overboard in the Gulf of Mexico. Fernandez, initially not knowing who had fallen, jumped in the water to save her, he recalled in a 2013 interview.</p>
<p>Just before he received his many athletic honors, the Marlins surprised Fernandez by flying his grandmother to the U.S. from Cuba. The emotional reunion, which was captured on video, marked the first time they had seen each other since he had left the island nation. </p>
<p>Fernandez credited his grandmother with teaching him how to catch a baseball and called her “the most important person in my life.”</p>
<p>One of Fernandez’s last posts on Instagram, which showed a woman holding what appears to be a pregnant belly, hinted that he may have been expecting his first child.</p>
<p>“I’m so glad you came into my life. I’m ready for where this journey is gonna take us together. #familyfirst,” its caption read.</p>
<p>Fellow athletes expressed their condolences after hearing the news of Fernandez’s death. </p>

<p>Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kevin Garnett announced his retirement after 21 NBA seasons on Friday, leaving behind a legacy of ultimate intensity and defensive prowess.</p>
<p>Garnett brought down the curtain on his career via a farewell video on Instagram.</p>
<p>“I’m just thankful man, I can’t ever ever put that into words,” the 40-year-old said. “I’m just thankful to everybody and the love. I never would’ve thought that people would love me like this. For it to be a reality is just something else.”</p>
<p>Garnett’s departure is the latest in a year which also saw future Hall of Fame players Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan bid adieu to the NBA.</p>
<p>The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that Garnett, who was signed for $8 million this season, had reached a contract settlement with the Timberwolves earlier on Friday.</p>
<p>“It has been a real joy to watch KG come into the league as a young man and watch him develop his skills to become one of the very best in the NBA,” Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor said in a statement.</p>
<p>“I have treasured the opportunity to see him grow as a leader. I wish him continued success in the next chapter of his life. His Minnesota fans will always cherish the memories he has provided.”</p>
<p>Garnett, easily the most productive player in franchise history, spent 13 1/2 of his 21 NBA seasons with Minnesota.</p>
<p>He was drafted out of high school in 1995 and his success helped usher in an era of players foregoing college to leap into the NBA – LeBron James and Bryant chief among them.</p>
<p>Garnett earned more than $330 million in his career, the most by any player in league history, but it was his intensity as well as his pay and production that earned him the nickname “The Big Ticket”.</p>
<p>He was one of basketball’s indelible personalities, known for his constant trash-talking and emotion. His pre-game ritual involved bumping his head on the basket support while muttering to himself.</p>
<p>After the tip-off, he was one of the most versatile power forwards in NBA history, showcasing his ability to dribble, shoot, pass and guard every position on the court despite being nearly seven-foot.</p>
<p>A 15-time All-Star, Garnett ranked 17th with 26,071 career points, ninth in career rebounds with 14,662 and 17th in blocked shots with 2,037.</p>
<p>Garnett spent his first 12 seasons in Minnesota, capturing the league’s MVP in 2004, before joining the Boston Celtics where he cemented his status by winning an NBA championship in 2008.</p>
<p>He spent a short stint with the Brooklyn Nets before returning to Minnesota in 2015 to finish his stellar career back where it all started.</p>

<p>The show must go on!</p>
<p>New Zealand rugby star Sonny Bill Williams may be temporarily out of action with a ruptured Achilles tendon.</p>
<p>But the injury isn’t stopping the 31-year-old winger from keeping fit — and he’s come up with an ingenious way to continue exercising.</p>
<p>Instead of kicking back and making the most of his time off, Williams posted the above video on Twitter Thursday of him working up a sweat on a rowing machine. </p>
<p>But to do so, he’s strapped his protected left leg onto a longboard — which moves back and forth as he pounds the exercise equipment.</p>
<p>Williams sustained the injury while representing New Zealand in the 7s tournament at the Rio 2016 Olympics. He’s expected to return to the field of play later this year.</p>
<p>His determination to remain fit proves there’s no excuse not to stay in shape next time you feel a bit sore.</p>

<p>Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan released a statement Thursday, calling for the people of Charlotte to demonstrate peacefully and non-violently in the wake of the death of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott earlier this week. </p>
<p>“In light of the tragic events of the past three days, it is more important than ever that we restore calm and come together, as a community, in peaceful demonstration and conversation, and in constructive and non-violent ways,” the former Chicago Bulls great wrote in part.</p>
<p>What started as a peaceful vigil for Scott in Charlotte ended in riots and violence on Wednesday night. One protester was shot, and four police officers were injured as protesters looted stores and officers shot rubber bullets. </p>
<p>Jordan has long been criticized for his seeming unwillingness to wade into political waters ― Kareem Abdul-Jabbar once said he had chosen “commerce over conscience” ― but that appears to be changing. In July, Jordan wrote in a letter released on ESPN’s The Undefeated that he felt he could “no longer stay silent” in the wake of a series of police shootings. </p>
<p>“As a proud American, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement and angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers,” Jordan wrote. “I grieve with the families who have lost loved ones, as I know their pain all too well.”</p>
<p>Jordan’s own father, James Jordan, died in 1993 after he was found in a creek. He had been shot in the chest.</p>

<p>Richard Sherman is well known for his unconventional approach to press conferences ― and on Wednesday, the Seattle Seahawks cornerback took the stage to let reporters know what’s really on his mind.</p>
<p>Sherman started his weekly presser with a few words on the Seahawks’ upcoming game against the San Francisco 49ers. Then he told reporters he wouldn’t be taking questions about Sunday’s game.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to answer any questions today and it’s no offense to you guys,” Sherman told the crowd of reporters, as seen in the video below filmed by The News Tribune of Tacoma. “I think the state of things in the world today is very interesting.”</p>
<p>Sherman used the forum to address recent fatal police shootings of black men in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and in Charlotte, North Carolina, and to talk about the importance of the national anthem protests against police violence led by the 49ers’ Colin Kaepernick and other NFL athletes.</p>
<p>Then, still without taking any questions, Sherman walked out of the room. </p>
<p>Scroll to read the whole transcript below.</p>
<p>During his two-minute speech, Sherman said that certain NFL players are trying to take a stand and “raise people’s awareness,” but their message is still being ignored.</p>
<p>“I think the last couple days a couple more guys have gotten shot and killed in the middle of the street ... and I think people are still missing the point,” Sherman said. </p>
<p>“The reason these guys are kneeling, the reason we’re locking arms, is to bring people together to make people aware that this is not right,” he continued. “It’s not right for people to get killed in the street.”</p>
<p>Sherman explained that he tries to inspire kids when he’s doing community service. Though he warns kids to comply with the police for their safety, he said “there’s still a chance of them getting shot and no repercussions for anyone.”</p>
<p>“Something needs to be done,” Sherman continued. “And so, when a guy takes a knee, you can ignore it. You can say he’s not being patriotic, he’s not honoring the flag. I’m doing none of those things. I’m saying, straight up, this is wrong and we need to do something. So thank you guys, have a blessed day.”</p>
<p>After walking out of the press conference, Sherman answered reporters’ questions in the locker room, NBC’s Pro Football Talk reported.</p>
<p>At least 15 black people have died during police encounters since Aug. 26, when San Francisco’s Kaepernick began taking a knee during pre-game national anthems in protest of police violence, according to The Guardian.</p>
<p>Read Sherman’s full transcript below:</p>
<p> But I’m not going to answer any questions today and it’s no offense to you guys. I think the state of things in the world today is very interesting. I think you have players that are trying to take a stand and trying to be aware of social issue and try to make a stand an increase people’s awareness and put a spotlight on it and they’re being ignored. Whether they’re taking a knee or whether they’re locking arms, they’re trying to bring people together and unite them for a cause. I think the last couple days a couple more guys have gotten shot and killed in the middle of the street. More videos have come out of guys getting killed, and I think people are still missing the point. The reason these guys are kneeling, the reason we’re locking arms is to bring people together to make people aware that this is not right. It’s not right for people to get killed in the street. I do a lot of community service. I go out there and try to help kids and try to encourage them to be better and to aspire to more. And when you tell a kid, “When you’re dealing with police, just put your hands up and comply with everything,” and there’s still a chance of them getting shot and no repercussions for anyone, that’s an unfortunate time to be living. It’s an unfortunate place to be in. There’s not a lot you can tell a kid. There’s not a lot you can try to inspire... a person when you say, “We need black fathers to be in the community to stay their for your kids,” but they’re getting killed in the street for nothing, for putting their hands on their cars. And I think that’s the unfortunate part, that’s the unfortunate place that we’re living in. And something needs to be done. And so when a guy takes a knee, you can ignore it. You can say he’s not being patriotic, he’s not honoring the flag. I’m doing none of those things. I’m saying, straight up, this is wrong and we need to do something. So thank you guys, have a blessed day. </p>

<p>One-year starters in high school are not supposed to do this. Neither are FCS quarterbacks with scant Division 1 interest. But then, Carson Wentz isn’t your normal 23-year-old rookie quarterback.</p>
<p>While his counterpart, No. 1 overall pick Jared Goff, rides the bench with a clipboard for the Los Angeles Rams, Wentz has calmly helped the Philadelphia Eagles start a season 2-0. And he’s done so without committing a turnover ― a feat that no rookie quarterback has ever accomplished. In fact, Wentz is just the fourth rookie QB since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger to win his first two starts.</p>
<p>What seems to separate Wentz, whom Philly traded up for to select with the second pick last April, is not merely the remarkable physical tools, but the intelligent pre-snap reads, surprising toughness and sound mechanics. Having a 6-foot-5, 237-pound frame, along with a cannon arm and deft feet, doesn’t hurt either. </p>
<p>On Monday Night Football, with the entire nation watching his first-ever road start, Wentz came out slinging, throwing six straight passes and completing 8-9 on the Eagles’ opening drive, including a crucial fourth-down conversion. So much for Eagles rookie head coach Doug Pederson’s plan to ease his young signal caller into the game.</p>
<p>“He’s commanding the huddle,” Pederson ― himself a former NFL quarterback who took over for the controversial Chip Kelly ― said after his team’s 29-14 victory over the Chicago Bears. “It’s something a nine-, 10-year veteran would do. It’s showing his maturity and the ability that he has to play quarterback.”</p>
<p>Talk to anyone around the league ― offensive players, defensive, coaches, GMs ― and they will all tell you that playing quarterback in today’s NFL requires more savvy and intelligence than ever before. Formations are considerably more complicated than even 10 years ago, when guys like Ben Roethlisberger, Eli Manning and Phillip Rivers were entering the league. And defenses have developed counters to answer the trendy spread and up-tempo offensive schemes. Just the language quarterbacks now have to use can seem foreign.</p>
<p>While his numbers are good, they’re nothing a fantasy football owner would think twice about. He has completed nearly 61 percent of his passes to go along with three touchdowns. But what makes him so special and rare is the overall command ― the ability to check out of a running play to the left because he reads blitz, only to call a run away from the blitz. Or changing his protection with a disguised safety blitz. Or even bouncing back from a surefire touchdown after an inexcusable Jordan Matthews dropped pass right before halftime.</p>
<p>It’s only been two games, against the Bears and lowly Browns, but Wentz has executed his offense to near perfection.</p>
<p>These are things that longtime NFL quarterbacks struggle with ― just look at Jay Cutler on Monday ― and yet Wentz, who played his collegiate ball at North Dakota State and has yet to throw a pick, looks like a seasoned vet.</p>
<p>Perhaps Wentz’s confidence stems from those collegiate days, where winning and marshaling the line of scrimmage became habitual. The North Carolina native (his family moved to North Dakota when he was 3 years old) won five consecutive national titles, two of which came with him under center.</p>
<p>It’s ironic that it took a Teddy Bridgewater injury and Sam Bradford trade for Wentz to become the starter in Philly. Remember, he suffered a hairline rib fracture early in training camp and had been considered the third string option, slotted behind both Bradford and pricey free agent acquisition Chase Daniel.</p>
<p>But his time, unlike Goff, is clearly right now.</p>
<p>“I just have fun with it,” Wentz told SportsCenter after the game. “You just gotta have confidence. Confidence goes a long way.”</p>
