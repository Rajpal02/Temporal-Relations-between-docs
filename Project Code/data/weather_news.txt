<p> Weather Reports and Quizzes </p>
<p> This page is about the language used when reporting the weather in English, with audio weather reports and comprehension quizzes. </p>
<p> Every radio and TV show, and many newspapers and websites, report the weather. They give weather forecasts (what they think the weather will be in the future) and sometimes they report on what the weather has been in the past. Here are some typical expressions used in a weather report: </p>
<p> temperatures are going to plunge (rapidly get very cold) </p>
<p> temperatures are going to rise/climb (go up) </p>
<p> temperatures are going to soar (rapidly get very hot) </p>
<p> a warm/cold front is moving in (air from another region is arriving) </p>

<p> This is CKNY and I'm Anita Pierce with weather. We couldn't ask for a better day for the first day of Spring. Right now it's fifteen degrees and clear. We're expecting blue skies throughout the day. Though there is only a ten percent chance of showers, this good weather can't last forever. It's raining cats and dogs up north, so we should see rain by morning. Don't forget your umbrella tomorrow. Now, stay tuned for local news. </p>

<p> Hi, I'm Jesse Williams. This is your weekend weather report. This morning we're seeing sun with cloudy periods as well as a few flurries. Right now I am at the top of Mount Raven where it is plus two and expected to rise to about six degrees by noon. Overnight temperatures will probably drop to at least minus seven. Tomorrow's forecast calls for more flurries with a high of zero and a low of minus twelve. With the wind chill factor, that could put us at a record low of minus twenty. Conditions are perfect for skiing this weekend, but if you're heading out to the slopes tomorrow, please remember to bundle up to avoid frostbite. We'll go back to the newsroom now for a look at what's in sports. </p>

<p> Show transcriptHide transcript </p>
<p> Good morning, this is Alonzo Jacob with your Monday weather report. The heatwave that slowed everybody down this weekend is showing no signs of letting up this week. Our meteorologists suggest that today's temperature could climb to as high as 40 degrees Celsius by the late afternoon. Right now, only an hour after sunrise, the temperature here at the airport is already 29 degrees. However, there is relatively no humidity in the air, so it feels quite comfortable out here at the moment. Unfortunately, there is also no rain in the forecast for the next five days. This is bad news for the thirsty forest fires that are raging across the interior of our province. Looks like setting up a tent in the backyard may be the only way to catch some sleep tonight if you don't have airconditioning. That's all for today's weather. Stay tuned for the morning traffic report. </p>

<p> First round acceptance Second round opening statements Third and fourth round rebuttals </p>
<p> Opening Statements The general consensus seems to be that rainy weather is "bad" weather. It has its merits, however. The most basic of them is that rain waters plants. Even though it's the climate and not the weather that ultimately decides a plant's fate in the long run, one rainfall can be enough to save a lot of plants during a drought. And obviously it's all the rainy weathers accumulated that combine into climate. Rain is heartwarming. When sunny weather is the time when you go out and participate in various activities, rainy weather is the time when you sit back at home and read a book by a fireplace. Overall rain creates this aura of relaxation and cosiness - for instance the sound of rain drizzling on your windowsill and the natural colours outside that rain causes. Without rain there would be no snow. Snow is simply beautiful and essential if one wishes to ski, snowboard or sleigh. Rain is a natural way of cleaning. Begone filthy streets and dusty cars full of bird ****. Sunlight can be unblelievably annoying if you have to face the sun a certain amount of time. Not only does it hurt and cause damage to your eyes but it is also very tiring when you're exposed to it for too long. Sunburns are another reason why some people avoid sunny days. </p>
<p> I think it's an awesome debate. Why the heck not right? It's called having fun hldemi, you should try it sometime. Hldemi, you're quite the troll and that activity is popular among children... the only kind of adult you are is one with a stick up his anus. </p>
<p> Interesting how one can come to such conclusions from one debate made. Anyhow it seems like there's no point in arguing with you as the only arguments you've brought so far is how rubbish my debate is. I hope your ego feels better now as you've slated me. Also, really mature to call someone a kid. /s </p>
<p> How can opponent know what he is accepting if you didnt offer definitions is the first round ? Surely dull topic with no philosophical value can be interested to others. Kids particularly . This site needs "Kids" section to that those "is lemon better then dildo" debates are not in my debate list. And surely, you are gonna broaden your knowledge by discussing is rain better then sun. Its so engaging and thought provoking. Im not trying to make you more productive, Im trying to provoke you to snap out of those childish stuff and engage more intellectually appropriate debates that will allow you to learn far more, to expand your horizons and have fun while doing so. </p>
<p> Honestly I don't know what to say to such ignorance... First of all, what you might find as a dull topic can be interesting to others. All the immigration and gun law debates have been done to death. No topic is "worthless" if the debate is done properly. The art of great debating is not only finding more facts on the internet, but also making your ideas more appealing and relatable to the neutral viewer (notice how dictatorships work). The topic is defined properly. I'm planning to explain what I define as "better" in the opening statements. The ones you didn't give me a chance to give before condemning my debate to be worthless. And most importantly every debate doesn't have to be concerning real life problems. I came to this website to broaden my knowledge and have fun. Shame on you for trying to make me feel bad about myself because of that. Besides, the whole point of your arrogant comment was that I should be more productive with my debates. Would you consider your comments as productive? </p>
<p> Out of all the interesting and mind boggling topics you choose to debate if some weather is better then the other. Whats the world coming to. And besides it being worthless theme its also not defined properly. Define "better" ! Whats the point of debating the subjective tastes. Better for what ? Rain is definitely not better for a someone that wants to have picnic in the open or for someone wanting to take a sunbath. </p>
<p> This debate has been configured to only allow voters who meet the requirements set by the debaters. This debate either has an Elo score requirement or is to be voted on by a select panel of judges. </p>

<p> Severe thunderstorms with destructive winds, heavy rain and large hailstones are set to lash south-east Queensland this afternoon as the region still reels from last week's flood disaster. </p>
<p> Key points: </p>
<p> The BOM says there is the potential for hail greater than five centimetres </p>
<p> Up to 100 millimetres of rain could fall in some areas </p>
<p> The BOM said some of the places worst hit by the floods could see heavy falls </p>
<p> Earlier on Wednesday afternoon, storm cells were detected near Gympie and Noosa on the Sunshine Coast, with a warning for damaging winds and heavy rain that could lead to flash flooding. </p>
<p> Later in the day, a fresh warning was issued for Logan, Scenic Rim and the Gold Coast. </p>
<p> Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) duty forecaster Rohan Smith said an unstable atmosphere was creating perfect storm conditions, with Brisbane, the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast the main areas of concern. </p>
<p> "We've got a south-easterly surge coming up the New South Wales coast," Mr Smith said. </p>
<p> "[It is] very dynamic ‚Ä¶ going to kick off some pretty severe thunderstorms around the north-east New South Wales, south-east Queensland area. </p>
<p> "We're actually looking at potentially destructive winds, which is a category above damaging, which is a gust of 125 kilometres per hour or greater. </p>
<p> "So quite severe thunderstorms on the cards." </p>
<p> Mr Smith said up to 100 millimetres of rain could fall in some areas, leading to flash flooding in already saturated catchments. </p>
<p> "If you are under a thunderstorm cell, you could get 100mm in a relatively short period of time, which is fairly concerning," Mr Smith said. </p>
<p> "So flash flooding is a concern today with these storms. </p>
<p> "Potentially the areas that were the worst hit by the heavy rainfall recently, they could see heavy falls from a thunderstorm today. </p>
<p> "[We are] looking at some thunderstorms moving across the Brisbane area from the west during the morning ‚Ä¶ but that's only really a prerequisite to real action, which is kicking off in the afternoon." </p>

<p> 14 day UK weather forecast </p>
<p> Cold and wintry period </p>
<p> UK outlook issued Sunday 27th March 2022 </p>
<p> Week 1 </p>
<p> Becoming cold. </p>
<p> Monday: Scattered showers develop, mostly in northern England. However, most places remain dry and bright. Feeling warm in the sunshine. </p>
<p> Tuesday: Outbreaks of rain are likely in southern and possibly central regions. In the north, an area of patchy rain pushes southwards. Colder conditions follow into Scotland and wintry showers develop. </p>
<p> Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday: Colder weather pushes southwards across all of the UK. Wintry showers develop, but they will be mostly focused on northern and eastern Britain. There could be some longer spells of rain, sleet and snow during the first couple of days and significant accumulations are possible over higher ground. Frost becomes widespread on some nights. </p>
<p> Forecast confidence is high falling to medium. </p>
<p> Week 2 </p>
<p> Cold start then changeable. </p>
<p> The period starts cold and wintry showers continue in the east. However, a change to more unsettled and milder weather is expected to gradually take place. All areas then have showers or longer spells of rain. </p>
<p> Forecast confidence is very low. </p>
<p> Overview </p>
<p> Week 1 </p>
<p> High pressure becomes centred to the northwest. That allows cold Arctic air to sweep southwards across the UK and some computer models are indicating a potent wintry spell for the time of the year. </p>
<p> Week 2 </p>
<p> Cold air remains in place early on but areas of low pressure are expected to deepen and bring back a milder Atlantic flow quite quickly. </p>

<p> India vs South Africa Cricket Weather: Sunny Conditions to Return on Day 3-4; Rain May Play Spoilsport Again on Day 5 </p>
<p> 28 December, 2021 </p>
<p> TWC India </p>
<p> Tuesday, December 28: After Day 2 of the opening test match between India and South Africa getting called off due to heavy and persistent rains, sunny conditions are expected to make a comeback in Centurion for the next two days. However, wet weather may play spoil-sport once again on the fifth day of the game. </p>
<p> As per The Weather Channel‚Äôs met team, the SuperSport Park Cricket Stadium in South Africa‚Äôs Centurion, Gauteng, will witness sunny and clear skies on Tuesday, while the chances of rainfall will be at a very low 4%. The daytime temperatures will also peak at about 26.5¬∞C, offering largely pleasant weather for both teams on Day 3. </p>
<p> Such conditions often favour the batsmen, as clear skies prevent the ball from swinging too much. A Sun-beaten pitch also lacks moisture, which usually helps the batting sides score higher. It will be interesting to see just how much this benefits the batters, especially with the pitch report revealing the wicket to be grassy. </p>
<p> Even if the ground does become a batting paradise on Day 3, it is unlikely to last for long, as the Centurion skies are expected to get cloudier from Wednesday, December 29. The forecast indicates mostly sunny conditions on Day 4, although the daytime temperatures may see a slight increase up to 28.2¬∞C. </p>
<p> The likelihood of rainfall for the day will rise to 20%, which is still low enough to not halt the gameplay completely. But if the overall conditions do end up being more overcast, the fast bowlers may receive a slight edge, as this type of weather makes the ball swing and move in the air a lot better. </p>
<p> Day 5 is when the weather may pose a problem once again, with the weather.com meteorologists predicting a 63% likelihood of thunderstorms and up to 5 mm precipitation on Thursday, December 30. </p>
<p> As per the hourly forecast, the chances of rainfall on the day will be as high as 43% between 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. (local time), increase up to 63% between 2 p.m. to 5 p.m., and hover around 60% post 6 p.m. </p>
<p> The maximum temperature during the day will fall slightly to 27.3¬∞C, whereas the humidity levels will rise from around 50% from the previous two days to 61% on Thursday morning. </p>
<p> Overall, if luck prevails, Day 5 might not see a complete calling-off of the match similar to Day 3‚Äîwhen the possibility of rainfall was 100%‚Äîalthough the game is likely to get affected by the weather up to a notable extent. </p>

<p> Severe Thunderstorm Outbreak Packing Widespread Damaging Winds, Tornadoes Expected This Week </p>
<p> By weather.com meteorologists </p>
<p> 8 hours ago </p>
<p> At a Glance </p>
<p> A widespread storm will track through the central and eastern states. </p>
<p> An outbreak of severe storms will spread from the Plains to the South and East. </p>
<p> Widespread damaging winds, tornadoes, large hail and flash flooding are all threats. </p>
<p> A multi-day outbreak of severe thunderstorms will pack widespread destructive winds, tornadoes, large hail and heavy rain in portions of the Plains, South and East through midweek. </p>
<p> The setup is familiar for spring, with a sharp southward plunge of the jet stream and an area of low pressure aloft tracking from the Southwest toward the central and eastern United States. That storm system will tap into a supply of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, leading to the development of widespread rain and thunderstorms. </p>
<p> Severe thunderstorms from this system will impact some of the same areas that were hit by another damaging outbreak a week ago. This includes the potential for 70 mph wind gusts and strong tornadoes, particularly from the lower Mississippi Valley into Alabama on Wednesday. </p>
<p> Here's a look at what to expect. </p>
<p> Forecast </p>
<p> Tuesday Night-Early Wednesday </p>
<p> Right now, this storm is producing rain and mountain snow in the Southwest. </p>
<p> Rain and thunderstorms will become widespread by late Tuesday and especially Tuesday night in the Plains and Midwest. </p>
<p> Severe storms are most probable from northern and central Texas into Oklahoma, eastern Kansas, western Missouri, western Arkansas and possibly into Iowa. Those storms could pack damaging winds, large hail and an isolated tornado threat. </p>
<p> Localized flash flooding from heavy rain cannot be ruled out in many of those same areas. </p>
<p> Wednesday-Wednesday Night </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Wednesday and Wednesday night appear to have the most widespread severe thunderstorm threat. </p>
<p> Severe storms could hit areas from far eastern Texas into Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, the Florida Panhandle, southeast Missouri, southern Illinois, southern Indiana and western and central Kentucky. The chance of severe storms could extend as far east as western and northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee by the early morning hours of Thursday. </p>
<p> A squall line of strong to severe storms is likely to be ongoing in the morning on the western edge of the severe threat area depicted below. That line of storms will pack a dangerous severe weather threat as it advances eastward through the day. There might be some isolated supercells that develop ahead of this line that could also produce severe weather. </p>
<p> Widespread damaging winds, tornadoes and large hail will all be hazards, especially in areas shaded purple and darker red in the map below. Wind gusts could top 70 mph in some areas, and strong tornadoes (EF2 or greater damage) are possible. </p>
<p> Heavy rain might contribute to localized flooding in parts of the South and Midwest. </p>
<p> Thursday </p>
<p> There could be a continuation of severe storms from this system in the East on Thursday in one or two rounds. </p>
<p> Damaging wind gusts would be the primary concern from any severe storms that develop from portions of the mid-Atlantic into the Southeast. A few tornadoes cannot be ruled out. </p>

<p> Windy, Rainy, Warmer Than Usual Start to Week </p>
<p> Showers will develop from west to east this morning and start to move off shore later this afternoon </p>
<p> By David Bagley ‚Ä¢ Published March 6, 2022 ‚Ä¢ Updated on March 6, 2022 at 7:19 am </p>
<p> Gusty winds, scattered showers, and unseasonably warm temperatures will be with us today as low pressure tracks north of the region today. Showers will develop from west to east this morning and start to move off shore later this afternoon. The only exception will be across northern Maine where we will see a mixture of snow and sleet changing to rain by this afternoon as milder air chases the cold air out of the area. A coating to an inch or so of snow/sleet is possible. </p>
<p> Along with the showers today, winds out of the southwest will crank up, especially this afternoon with gusts 30-40mph at times. High temps reach the upper 50s to low 60s south, cooler south facing shorelines, low 50s north, around 40 northern Maine. </p>
<p> This evening we‚Äôll see another round of showers developing across northern New England and track into southern New England during the first portion of the night as a cold front slides through the region. The front will usher colder air back into northern areas, but it‚Äôll still remain mild south during the overnight. Monday we‚Äôll see another area of low pressure track through the region bringing another round of precipitation. </p>
<p> With cold air in place once again across far northern New England, it‚Äôll most likely start off as snow and continue right into Monday night with several inches possible when all is said and done. Central and southern New England will be too mild to support snow and will likely be mostly rain, but we could see a turn over to snow across the higher elevations of western Mass. into southern New Hampshire early Tuesday night before the precipitation cuts off. The rest of next week is looking a bit warmer than average with a couple disturbances moving through, one possible late Wednesday and Wednesday night which may bring some rain and snow -- not too much confidence in models with that one. </p>

<p> Another Friday which looks to be a rain event with mild air in place. That portion of the forecast still needs a bit of smoothing out, stay tuned! </p>

<p> Rain Moves in Overnight, Milder Temperatures Ahead </p>
<p> Sunday and Monday are both mild with heavy downpours at some point during the day. </p>
<p> By Darren Sweeney ‚Ä¢ Published March 5, 2022 ‚Ä¢ Updated on March 5, 2022 at 11:14 pm </p>
<p> After a couple of chilly days, milder air is working into the state over the weekend. </p>
<p> We returned to seasonable temperatures in the 40s Saturday afternoon, following the highs in the 30s that rounded out the work week. </p>
<p> Along with the milder air, rain started to move in Saturday night and will continue into the morning hours Sunday. </p>
<p> Some light freezing drizzle is possible inland overnight. </p>
<p> Stay informed about local news and weather. Get the NBC Connecticut app for iOS or Android and pick your alerts. </p>
<p> A warm front is approaching the state. Along with this front, clouds and a round of showers are likely. </p>
<p> The showers will be mainly centered on Sunday morning. </p>
<p> Once the showers clear the state, afternoon high temperatures are expected to warm into the upper 50s to lower 60s. The March 6 record high temperature at Windsor Locks is 64 degrees. </p>
<p> Another round of rain moves in on Monday. The heaviest rain holds off until the afternoon. </p>
<p> We'll be tracking heavy rain and a better chance for thunderstorms on Monday. There's a low risk for flash flooding on Monday, as well. </p>

<p> The wind direction will have an important influence on the expected weather. You can often be given a wind direction and you will have a pretty good idea of how the weather will change and what weather can be expected with that wind direction. </p>
<p> The typical wind direction that a location has for a certain time of the year is called the prevailing wind. When the wind is from the prevailing direction then the weather is generally typical. When the wind shifts away from the prevailing direction then it often indicates atypical or changing weather. </p>
<p> For your forecast location, note what type of environment is located in every direction from the location. Take Dallas for example, toward the southeast is the moisture source of the Gulf of Mexico; toward the east is the typically warm and humid southeast; toward the north are the plains which can bring in cooler air in the cool season; toward the west and southwest is a very dry high elevation climate; toward the south is the transition between the coastal area and dry portions of Texas. A wind from the north in Dallas will tend to bring in cooler and drier air; a wind from the southwest will bring in very dry air; a wind from the southeast will bring in warm and humid air. Just by noting the wind direction a forecaster gains an idea of what type of air mass is moving toward the forecast area. </p>
<p> Wind direction changes often accompany changes in the weather. The air flows cyclonically around low pressure systems. If the wind changes direction in a cyclonic fashion it often means a low pressure or front is influencing the forecast area. A wind shifting from the south often means warmer air is approaching and a wind from the north often means cooler air is approaching. When the wind changes abruptly it could be a frontal passage or wind direction change caused by thunderstorm outflow. </p>
<p> When the wind speeds are light then a change in wind direction is not as significant. You may have heard the phrase "winds will be light and variable". When the winds are light it indicates there is not much of a steering current to move the wind. When winds are light, mesoscale influences will tend to start influencing wind direction. The winds can continue shifting from a variety of directions when winds are light. </p>
<p> When analyzing MOS data make sure to note the wind speed and direction over the course of the forecast period. That information alone can give you clues to what weather to expect. </p>

adjectives we use to describe
the temperature:
cold, cool, warm, hot.

cool

What is the temperature used for?
In weather forecast, the temperature
describes how hot or cold it will be in a
period or at a specific time.

Most countries use Celsius (¬∫C) as
their official temperature scale.
Only a few countries, including the
United States, use Fahrenheit (¬∞F).

Predicting the weather with the future simple
Future simple: Subject + will + verb in base form (be) + complement

Use the future simple to make predictions about the weather:
The weather will be very hot tomorrow.
The weather will be cold on the weekend.

Use the pronoun ‚Äúit‚Äù to refer to the weather:
It will be very hot tomorrow.
It will be cold on the weekend.

It will be very hot on
the weekend.

Using ‚Äúhighs‚Äù and ‚Äúlows‚Äù
‚Äúhighs‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh temperatures‚Äù
describes the maximum
temperature for a period:

‚Äúlows‚Äù or ‚Äúlow temperatures‚Äù
describes the minimum
temperature for a period:

‚ÄúHighs will be in the 50s.‚Äù
‚ÄúHigh temperatures will be in the 50s‚Äù

‚ÄúLows will be in the 40s.‚Äù
‚ÄúLow temperatures will be in the 40s.‚Äù

Highs will be in the 50s.
This sentence means that maximum temperatures
may vary from 50 to 59 degrees.

Highs will be in the 50s
next week.

Using ‚Äúlower‚Äù, ‚Äúmid‚Äù, and ‚Äúupper‚Äù
Use these words to describe
temperature range (variation):

Temperatures will be in the lower 80s.
It means that they will vary from 80¬∞ to 84¬∞.

Note:
You can use ‚Äúlower‚Äù, ‚Äúmid‚Äù, and
‚Äúupper‚Äù to describe either hot or cold
temperatures. For example:

Temperatures will be in the mid 80s.
It means that they will vary from 86¬∞ to
89¬∞.

Highs will be in the lower 80s.
It means that high temperatures will
vary from 80 to 84¬∞ - this is very hot!

Temperatures will be in the upper 80s.
It means that they will vary from 86¬∞ to 89¬∞.

Lows will be in the upper 30s.
It means that low temperatures will
vary from 36 to 39¬∞ - this is very cold!

Late night and early morning
lows will most likely be 30
degrees.

During next week, afternoons high
temperatures will be in the mid 50s
warming to upper 50s near the end of
the week. A few of the milder afternoons
will get up into the mid 60s.

Predicting the weather with the future simple
Future simple: Subject + will + verb in base form

It will rain.

It will wind.
It will snow.

You can use future simple with
other verbs in the base form to
describe the weather.

Going to or will?
Use the future tense ‚Äúgoing to‚Äù to make predictions
about the weather in the near future. It‚Äôs used
when you are sure that something will happen,
because you have some evidence.

Use the future tense ‚Äúwill‚Äù for predictions
about the weather in the future, when
there isn‚Äôt any strong evidence about it at
the moment of speaking.

There‚Äôs going to be thunders
and lighting. There are dark
clouds in the sky.
There will be scattered
rains during the day.

Tip for you!

Dica de estudo:

Create rewards for fulfilled goals
One way to keep your motivation high is to
reward yourself for meeting a goal. It doesn't
have to be anything big: a chocolate bar after
studying a unit or the opportunity to watch your
favorite series at the end of the lesson are
already good rewards. It's a great way to keep
your brain motivated and interested in what
needs to be done.

<p> TOP 10 WEATHER RELATED PROBLEMS PEOPLE COMPLAIN ABOUT </p>
<p> METEOROLOGIST JEFF HABY </p>
<p> 10. Rain: People will often blame their problems on the rain. This could be raining on an outdoor event, a wedding, flooding, late for work, bad mood, etc. The rain makes some people less happy than a sunny day does. </p>
<p> 9. Wind: When the wind is too strong you may hear people talking about what is the deal with this wind? Wind storms can tear down fences and produce other property damage. In general the stronger the wind the more the complaints. The wind can also kick up dust and make driving and walking more difficult. Wind also makes cold air feel colder. You may here people say something to the effect: The weather would not be so bad if the wind was not blowing. Also the most violent wind on earth is the tornado and we know how unpleasant they are. </p>
<p> 8. Dirty air: The sight of the brown ozone and pollution cloud over an urbanized area can be unhappy to see. Having to breath that air is unpleasant. It can make people feel guilty when they have to use gas powered equipment such as a lawn mover or vehicle. Each person adds a little to that dirty brown cloud hovering over the city. It can be downright depressing. </p>
<p> 7. Humidity: You may hear something to the effect that it is not the heat but the humidity. The humidity can make the air feel like it is hard to breath. It makes you feel hotter since perspiration does not evaporate as quickly. </p>
<p> 6. Hurricanes: Pick a infamous hurricane from the past and you will find some people still complaining about it and blaming problems on it. You may hear something like if only that hurricane did not hit. Hurricanes can ruin lives. They combine several things people complain about: rain, wind, flooding. </p>
<p> 5. Ice: It makes driving a nightmare. It causes damage. If the electricity goes out it can be very unpleasant. Some people may panic and buy weeks of supplies at the food store. It makes for a great inconvenience that people love to complain about. </p>
<p> 4. Drought: When it is too dry the vegetation does not look as pretty. Having to ration water and having to figure out how to get everything watered can be a problem. As the drought continues further people continue to get more irritable. You will hear murmurings of when is it freaking going to rain? Combined with very hot weather it can really get people complaining. </p>
<p> 3. Too hot or too cold: Some big complaints come from these extreme temperature events. Either one sends the utility bills through the roof. The conditions outside can not be enjoyed. When it is too hot you start sweating right away and if it is too cold it can take half an hour to dress for it properly. When it is too hot being too cold sounds so great and vice versa. On a very hot day you may hear someone say getting into the car is like getting into an oven and my back gets sweaty. </p>
<p> 2. El Nino: This has been blamed for just about everything. No matter what weather is occurring some people will claim it has to have some relation to El Nino. There has to be something to blame this unpleasant weather on. Since El Nino controls the weather patterns it must be the cause of all weather problems. If only El Nino would listen to our problems and stop the ill impacts on the weather. </p>
<p> 1. Global warming: Any bad weather will sometimes get blamed on global warming. Whether it be too much or too little rain or too hot weather. You may hear something to the effect that humans are destroying the earth and a great climatic disaster will occur. It gets people talking and it can be popular to complain about. A new ice age or the planet burning up are complained about and global warming is blamed. </p>

<p> The Bureau of Meteorology on Sunday issued a severe weather warning covering a wide swathe of the region, from the northern Sunshine Coast to Coolangatta on the Queensland-New South Wales border, and west out to Gatton. </p>
<p> Predictions evolved throughout the evening and by midnight the warning was limited to a wide strip further west, from inland of Bundaberg down to the border at Stanthorpe. </p>
<p> The severe weather is due to a coastal trough over the south-east, which is only expected to deepen in the next two days. </p>
<p> Heavy rain was expected from Sunday night, with widespread falls of up to 180mm. </p>
<p> Even larger falls of up to 250mm are predicted in isolated spots where thunderstorms are forecast. </p>
<p> Some parts of the region recorded falls of close to 100mm in the course of just a few hours on Sunday. </p>
<p> There is a risk of flash flooding on Monday and Tuesday as well, with northern NSW facing the same problem. </p>
<p> Forecasters have said it won't take much rain to raise the water level to flooding, due to the saturated ground left by recent weather events. </p>
<p> It comes after waterspouts were seen on Saturday off the NSW South Coast, which was subject to flash floods and heavy rain yesterday. </p>

<p> Weekend weather temps 20 degrees above normal will mark the start of meteorological spring </p>
<p> Break out the tank tops, because springtime weather is finally about to reach North Central Ohio. </p>
<p> At least, we can hope. </p>
<p> Temperatures across the region are forecast to hit 65 on Saturday and 68 Sunday, according to Raelene Campbell, a meteorologist in the Cleveland office of the National Weather Service. </p>

<p> "If the clouds move out, we could be even warmer than 65 Saturday," Campbell said. </p>
<p> That would be a welcome end to a 162-day cold spell ‚Äî the last day the thermometer hit 65 degrees in Crawford, Richland or Ashland counties was Sept. 25. </p>
<p> '20 degrees above normal' </p>
<p> The warm weekend will be memorable, but not quite record-setting. </p>
<p> The highest temperature ever recorded on a March 5 at Mansfield Lahm Regional Airport was 76 degrees in 1983. That record likely will last at least another year. </p>
<p> "If anything, if clouds stay away a bit longer Saturday, we might get near 70," Campbell said. "I don't think we'd get much higher." </p>
<p> But it might feel like a record after last year's March 5 temperature of 39, as well as the date's average historical high of 41 degrees. </p>
<p> "This is looking to be 20 degrees above normal," Campbell said. </p>
<p> Some clouds and rain in the weekend forecast </p>
<p> The weekend was forecast to begin with partly sunny skies Friday and a high of 43. After an overnight low of 34, things were projected to warm up again Saturday morning. </p>
<p> Saturday will be slightly breezy and partly cloudy with a high of 65. </p>
<p> "There's going to be quite a few clouds lingering before the precipitation moves in Saturday night," Campbell said. </p>
<p> Light showers will fall overnight Saturday and throughout the day Sunday. </p>
<p> Total precipitation for the weekend is only supposed to measure about a quarter of an inch. </p>
<p> "The higher amounts of rain should be Columbus down through Cincinnati," Campbell said. </p>
<p> Sunday is again supposed to be partly cloudy, but with a high of 68. There is a slight chance the storm will cover the region a little more than expected. </p>
<p> "That could keep it a few degrees cooler than we had forecast, but it should still be in the 60s," Campbell said. "It would just be wet and in the 60s." </p>
<p> The warm spell is expected to fade Sunday night, leaving the area with more seasonal weather during the coming week. </p>
<p> "We're looking to stay to the mid to low 40s, at least through Thursday," Campbell said. "After that it looks like temperatures start to warm up again." </p>
<p> More winter precipitation than normal </p>
<p> The time change and start of astronomical spring may still be a week or two in the future, but according to the weather experts, winter ended and meteorological spring began March 1. </p>
<p> It brought a close to a winter that started mildly before turning quite dramatic. </p>
<p> The official weather station at the Mansfield airport recorded 13.17 inches of liquid precipitation between Dec. 1 and Feb. 28, more than four inches more than the season's average of 8.77 inches. </p>
<p> That number includes both liquid precipitation and melted snowfall. </p>
<p> "We call it gauge catch," Campbell said. "It's essentially anything that falls within the rain gauge." </p>
<p> Almost all of the season's measurable snowfalls came toward the end. The region only recorded 21.4 inches of snow, quite less than the average of 37. </p>
<p> "So snow values we were below average," Campbell said. "But they were more impactful because they all occurred in January and February." </p>

<p> Strong to damaging winds will impact the eastern plains, coupled with critical fire weather and blowing dust. Windy weather extends areawide, but not as strong through western and central NM where increased shower activity and mountain snow is expected. </p>
<p> Another strong spring storm will move across NM today and tonight with strong winds, valley rain, mountain snow, and even a few thunderstorms. Temperatures will be warmer with this system compared to previous storms but snowfall is still possible across the higher terrain. Additional light snow accumulations are possible through Wednesday and Wednesday night across northern NM. </p>
<p> The combination of strong winds and dry conditions will produce critical fire weather through eastern NM today. Be sure to practice fire safety and avoid activities that may cause a spark. </p>
<p> Strong winds will develop today and Wednesday. The strongest winds are expected today when damaging gusts will be possible across the south central mountains and eastern plains. Winds will shift direction, turning more northwesterly or northerly on Wednesday with the western and central areas of New Mexico observing gusts of 30 to 45 mph. Blowing dust is possible both today and Wednesday. </p>
<p> Cooler temperatures are expected through Thursday with a warm-up starting Friday and continuing through the weekend. </p>
<p> Unsettled weather will develop this week with strong winds, rain, snow and even some thunderstorms. Precipitation chances favor the northern mountains and northeast quarter this week. Accumulating snow is expected for most areas above about 7500 feet. </p>

<p> These students want to revolutionise the weather prediction market with hyperlocal forecasting startup </p>
<p> Founded in 2020, Frizzle is a software and hardware IoT firm, which claims to provide more than 90 percent accurate hyperlocal weather forecasts. It is working with 4 clients and targeting farmers along with delivery and agriculture startups. </p>
<p> false </p>
<p> Vanya Arikutharam would have done well to recall what AA Milne said via Winnie the Pooh aeons ago: ‚ÄúTut, Tut! It looks like rain!" </p>
<p> The engineering student at PES University, Bangalore, was walking home when it suddenly started raining, leaving the electronic equipment she was carting irrevocably damaged. </p>
<p> It was 2019, and she had relied on a weather app to gauge the day‚Äôs climatic conditions. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúI checked the weather on one of these apps, which said the day was going to be sunny. But the precarious Bangalore rain started and I realised the gap in the way weather is predicted,‚Äù Vanya says. </p>
<p> Get connected to Frizzle </p>
<p> It was 2019, and she knew something had to be done so that the weather didn‚Äôt rain on anyone‚Äôs parade. </p>
<p> Vanya Arikutharaman (second from left) with her team and Frizzle's hardware device </p>
<p> Vanya joined hands with three of her college mates who then turned co-founders‚Äì Anantha Krishna, Abhilash V, and Rishith Bhowmick‚Äì and found the weather prediction market was still macro instead of micro. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúThe information collection usually happens through satellite, which is very good for giving weather data for a city or a state. But what if you need information for your area? That is either not available or not accurate. But that has deeper use cases for farmers and business owners,‚Äù Vanya says. </p>
<p> Get connected to Frizzle </p>
<p> In 2020, Vanya and her friends decided to start ÔªøFrizzleÔªø, an internet of things (IoT) firm building the ‚Äúnext-generation of hyper-local weather forecasting services‚Äù . </p>
<p> Run by Kurtle Technologies Pvt. Ltd., Frizzle works with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) by leveraging weather forecasting and insights to have better margins, improved efficiencies, and higher customer satisfaction. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúWe majorly focus on hyperlocal weather forecasting. For instance, if a resort focuses mainly on outdoor activities, including jungle safari and bonfires, the customer experience is definitely compromised if it starts to rain. That cost is borne by the owner. But accurate predictions could have let them plan something else altogether,‚Äù Vanya says. </p>
<p> How does Frizzle work? </p>
<p> Frizzle uses a combination of hardware and software for weather prediction. The four co-founders have created a device that collects hyperlocal weather information, which is then combined with historical data collected from open sources. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúWe have our own forecasting algorithm, which is a hyperlocal weather entry, based on years‚Äô worth of historical data. And, we have an additional feedback loop from devices,‚Äù Vanya says. </p>

<p> You have been successfully registered for our daily newsletter. </p>
<p> These two are combined through an algorithm, which then predicts the weather. </p>
<p> The small and cost-effective device can be fixed or taken on the go. The hyperlocal weather engine gathers weather insights right from your location, ‚Äúanywhere from five minutes to six months into the future‚Äù. </p>
<p> The parameters it considers include temperature, pressure, humidity, rain, cloud over, and other conditions. </p>
<p> Vanya and her co-founders claim that their device is able to predict weather with over 95 percent accuracy. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúMost weather forecasting players take data from satellites. We have taken a bottom-up approach instead.‚Äù </p>
<p> So far, Frizzle has been testing their hardware and software with resorts, sports clubs, and farmers. The pricing varies greatly, but the average yearly plan costs about Rs 7 lakh. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúOur software is more in demand rather than the hardware as consumers find it a bit easier to operate. But the hardware gives 2-3 percent better accuracy than the software,‚Äù says Abhilash V, Co-founder and COO, Frizzle. </p>
<p> The firm is also in the process of testing their product with food delivery aggregators and agriculture startups. </p>
<p> The market and outlook </p>
<p> Hyperlocal data collection has become the new hot sector after the success of ÔªøMapmyIndiaÔªø. Backed by Qualcomm Ventures and Lightbox, MapmyIndia, which creates navigational maps, analytics, and tracking APIs for India, got listed on the Indian stock exchange in December 2021. </p>
<p> Weather forecasting services differ in terms of their usage, technology, and forecast purposes but are needed in aviation, marine, agriculture, energy & utilities, oil & gas, among other industries. This helps plan weather-sensitive operations in advance. </p>
<p> According to marketsandmarkets.com, the weather forecasting services market size is projected to grow from an estimated $1.7 billion in 2021 to $2.7 billion by 2026, at a CAGR of 9.9 percent during the forecast period. </p>
<p> While Frizzle‚Äôs hardware and software combination could be rare, it directly competes with more than a dozen weather-forecasting apps, including AccuWeather, My Radar and Dark Sky. </p>
<p> But the founders are not worried. </p>
<p> In the next few months, Vanya and her team want to build their brand to become a reliable weather source for enterprises. ‚ÄúWe aim to reach about 100 customers by the end of 2022.‚Äù </p>

<p> Sunny, windy and mild for North Texas </p>
<p> We're waking up under a clear sky, a bit of a breeze and slightly milder temperatures than the past couple of mornings. Temperatures are mainly in the forties at this hour. </p>
<p> Ample sunshine, a whole bunch of wind gusting to 35 mph and mild temperatures will greet you this afternoon. Highs will be in the mid seventies! Average high is 61Ôæü. </p>
<p> Clouds will invade overnight, with some patchy drizzle developing by daybreak. Lows will only be in the mid fifties. </p>
<p> A few showers will develop tomorrow, with the greatest chance east of Dallas. Nothing severe expected. High temperatures will be back in the seventies again. It will be very windy as well. </p>
<p> Shower and thunderstorms chances ramp up after midnight through early Thursday morning. As of now, I'm not overly concerned about a big severe weather outbreak around here. There will, however, be some pockets of damaging wind. We have the time of day and year on our side to limit the severity of the storms. I WILL keep one eye open for some isolated stronger storms between midnight and 6am. </p>
<p> Above-normal temperatures and breezy conditions are expected through tomorrow ahead of the next weather system, which will being a chance of showers and storms Wednesday night. A few storms may produce damaging wind gusts and hail. #texomawx #dfwwx #ctxwx pic.twitter.com/P74HncmBnV </p>
<p> A strong cold front will then sweep through here Thursday morning, bringing a lot of wind and sharply colder temperatures with it. We'll be hovering near 60Ôæü around sunrise, but temperatures will quickly fall into the forties by late morning into afternoon. Windchills will be in the thirties with a strong northerly wind gusting the 35 mph. It's gonna be a chilly day, but sunshine returns by late morning. </p>
<p> A very cold start is expected for Friday, as temperatures dip into the low to mid twenties with lightening wind. </p>
<p> Sunny and cool conditions will prevail on Friday with highs in the low fifties. </p>
<p> As most of our cold fronts have been this winter, the chilly air rapidly moves out. A beautiful weekend is forecast. Low sixties for Saturday, upper sixties for Sunday, and heck, we'll be back in the seventies on Monday and Tuesday next week! </p>

<p> A rainy day is ahead for us Friday while temperatures will be cooling through the day. </p>
<p> While it will not continually rain the whole day, there will be soggy conditions to close out this week. Thunderstorms may even be possible over southern Missouri during the morning as an area of low pressure passes over the state. </p>
<p> Temperatures will also be cooling through the day, starting in the upper 50s this morning, dropping to near 50 degrees by 4pm. </p>
<p> Winds will be breezy today too - therefore, wind chills. Gusts will range from 20 to 30 mph. </p>
<p> Rain will continue into the evening as temps slowly drop in the lower to middle 40s. Eventually, this rain will exit the region early Saturday morning leaving around 0.50" rainfall for most in central Missouri. </p>
<p> This rainfall is MUCH NEEDED. So far, wild fires have occurred across the Midwest and central plains on our driest air days, a sign of how absent the ground is of moisture. Much of western Missouri is now under a "long-term" drought. Even the frequent snowfalls we had in February did not equate to enough precipitation. </p>
<p> Clouds will be slow to clear Saturday morning, but my midday should be clear and sunny skies are expected by Saturday afternoon and Sunday! Temps will only reach the 50s Saturday, jumping in the upper 60s by Sunday. </p>
<p> Another storm system will move in to the Midwest early next week. Rain and thunderstorms can be expected from Monday evening through Wednesday evening. </p>

<p> Hello and good morning! Well, we're off to a good start in the south this week, as most of the rain from the weekend has disappeared ‚Äì just a few patches of cloud and maybe some showers here on the east coast. They'll all clear up by lunchtime, though. Over the next day or so, London and the area around Kent can expect a couple of isolated showers, but mostly dry through until Thursday. </p>
<p> It's not such good news for the north-west this week, I'm afraid: more wet weather, and not a lot of sunshine. Some of today's showers will be heavy ‚Äì and even thundery in Manchester and across the Pennines. Leeds will escape the thunderstorms, with drizzle and light rain only throughout the rest of the day and tonight. </p>
<p> Elsewhere it becomes dry today, but with some foggy patches towards Wales. In England, tomorrow morning will see a dry, bright start in most places, with high temperatures throughout the week. We might see one or two thunderstorms appearing as the week goes on, with temperatures everywhere at 29 to 30 degrees. </p>
<p> By the weekend, unfortunately, the dry weather will make way for mostly cloudy skies and rain. The rain will move from Scotland, down towards the north and reach the south coast by Saturday afternoon. Temperatures, at least, will stay mostly warm at around 21 degrees for the weekend. It might feel like a nice change from the high twenties and early thirties we'll see in the week. That's all from me until tomorrow. Enjoy the mini-heatwave while you can! </p>

<p> In my opinion, I prefer cold weather but it doesn't rain, I like cold weather because I can do all my activities relaxed without much heat, I'm not a big fan of heat, it suffocates me and doesn't allow me to be calm. My perfect days are when it's cold but it doesn't rain. Also, if I'm very cold, it's easy to solve. I just have a hot coffee and a good coat. </p>
<p> I was born and grew up in a country where there is only two weather seasons; summer, and rainy season. Obviously, I have a dream of moving to a place where there is winter. In addition, I wanted to experience snow, wear boots and winter jackets. But things change, now I live in a country where there is four weather season. At first, everything seems perfect experiencing cold season ,but I realize that I feel not very productive in this kind of weather. To sum up, I prefer warm weather than cold because I can be very productive at work at the same time I can be physically fit while enjoying a simple walk in the park. </p>
<p> Generally speaking, I‚Äôd like autumn best throughout the year. Because it‚Äôs no any heatwaves to endure annoyingly and there‚Äôre fantastic colourful scenes that the leafs of the trees from green changing to yellow or red elsewhere during this season. Even more, It‚Äôs relatively comfortable temperature to enjoys many outdoor sports just like jogging, running and hiking, etc. </p>
<p> Well, I prefer the warm weather in spring rather than the hot weather in summer and the cold weather in winter, I don't really like the light rain or drizzle when I have to go to work by bicycle but the heatwaves in summer are the worse. It's a bit annoying when I'm travelling on the cycle path and start to rain really hard, so I need to find a patch covered by some roof to avoid getting wet, I usually use a stop bus to wait throughout the storm clear up and make way for the sunshine. In the winter we have a lot of storms with heavy rain and thunders and some places in the countryside get isolated by the flooded routes caused by the higher levels of water running by the rivers caused by the heavy rain. </p>
<p> I like hot weather best because I don't need to wear a lot of clothes and can use a fan or get the cool breeze from the window. </p>
<p> i like cold weather, like have snow or something like that. because i live in a country which is tropical climate. there are two seasons clearly: dry and rain so that i want to experience cold weather. </p>
<p> 'to be off to a good start' means 'to be a good start'. In this case, the weather person means that the week in the south has started with good weather. When people in the UK speak of 'good weather', they almost always mean sunny weather. </p>
<p> Nowadays we can see a few situation of weather in just one day in Turkey. While north of country is rainy south of country is too hot -about 45 degrees- </p>
<p> Oo, I love sunny, hot day maybe because I live next to the sea...and I like to do sun bath on the sand and to be with darker tan :) But even in winter cold days have something amazing, but I`m sure its not energy bill :D :) </p>
<p> Cold weather and foggy are the best for me. I enjoy low temperatures and gray skies, as I'm walking or riding my bike. </p>
<p> I like sunshine, but not heat weather. It is comfortable for me, though I like rain sometime, and fresh air after rain, it is amazing. </p>
<p> It‚Äôs depend. When it‚Äôs sunday, i like rainy weather but on normal day i like cloudy or warm weather </p>
<p> I like rainy season. I also like cold season but not very cold.in this time where I live is very hot season. I hate hot season. It's very difficult for me. Hot season make you a very lazy person and not to much work. So I like temperature between 10¬∞-20¬∞ Celcius. </p>
<p> I prefer when it's raining because I love the cold air and the sound of the little drops. </p>
<p> I like all kinds of weather as long as I have the right clothes on (or maybe not lol). </p>
<p> I liked the rainy weather when I was living in a sunny city, and now I missed that weather since I live in an always wet, foggy town. </p>
<p> I love the fall and spring weather, little heat during the day and cooler nights. </p>
<p> Hello everyone! Could anyone tell me what the difference is between THROUGHOUT and THROUGH? Also, how and when to use these two words? Thank you in advance! Sincerely, Natasa </p>
<p> Both words have several uses, but I think the one that may be confusing is this: </p>
<p> The disease spread throughout the country. </p>
<p> The disease spread through the country. </p>
<p> In this use, the difference is degree: throughout suggests it reached every part of the country, while through suggests is spread widely, but not necessarily to every single place. </p>
<p> If you had a different context in mind then feel free to provide an example and we'll be happy to comment. </p>
<p> Thank you so much for the answer Peter M! I had some doubts about the next sentence: * It is important to maintain a positive attitude throughout the interview... And that's why I wasn't sure when to use through or throughout. :/ </p>
<p> The sentence is fine. We can use throughout to mean 'from beginning to end', which is the meaning it has in your example. </p>
<p> The weather I like most is drizzle, cloudy and wet days, because I usually sit down in my favorite couch of my house, reading a novel and drinking tea. </p>
<p> I like the cold weather. I live in Bogot√°, Colombia and I love the weather here because is not hot although sometimes drizzle I like that. Here we have heatwaves but is not usual, the most days are rainy days or with little sun </p>
<p> Hi What an interesting sounds did I hear while I was listening the recording ? :-))))))))))))))))))))) Do Britishcouncil record lesson on the kitchen ? :-)))))))))))))))))))))) </p>
<p> Actually, you're almost correct! The text is a weather forecast which people often listen to in the kitchen, so there are background noises from a kitchen. When I listen to it I feel like making myself a cup of tea! </p>
<p> More seriously, we often have background noises in our recordings. After all, the world is full of sounds and noise, and we think it's important for listening in the classroom to be in as similar as possible to listening outside the classroom. </p>
<p> I'm very sorry for the inconvenience. I'm not aware of any problems, but it looks as if you can post comments now. If this happens again, please feel free to contact us again. </p>

<p> Climate of South Africa </p>
<p> The climate of South Africa is determined by South Africa's situation between 22¬∞S and 35¬∞S, in the Southern Hemisphere's subtropical zone, and its location between two oceans, Atlantic and the Indian. South Africa has a hot, arid climate - except for areas at high altitude. </p>
<p> It has a wider variety of climates than most other countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and it has lower average temperatures than other countries within this range of latitude, like Australia, because much of the interior (central plateau or Highveld, including Johannesburg) of South Africa is at a higher elevation. </p>
<p> Winter temperatures may reach the freezing point at high altitude, but are at their most mild in coastal regions, particularly KwaZulu Natal Province and perhaps the Eastern Cape. Cold and warm coastal currents running north-west and north-east respectively account for the difference in climates between west and east coasts. The weather is also influenced by the El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation. </p>
<p> South Africa experiences a high degree of sunshine with rainfall about half of the global average, increasing from west to east, and with semi-desert regions in the north-west. While the Western Cape has a Mediterranean climate with winter rainfall, most of the country experiences summer rain. </p>
<p> Contents </p>
<p> South Africa has typical weather for the Southern Hemisphere, with the coldest days in June‚ÄìAugust. On the central plateau, which includes the Free State and Gauteng provinces, the altitude keeps the average temperatures below 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F)for example, lies at 1,753 metres (5,751 ft).itumeleng tsotetsi. In winter, temperatures at night can drop below freezing (and they do on average in cities such as Bethlehem and Frankfurt), also due to altitude, despite winter highs being similar to areas in Southern California, creating a rare high diurnal temperature variation in winter. During winter it is warmest in the coastal regions, especially on the eastern Indian Ocean coast. </p>
<p> Warm season weather is influenced by the El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation (ENSO).a experiences hotter and drier weather during the El Ni√±o phase, while La Ni√±a brings cooler and wetter conditions. </p>
<p> South Africa is a sunny country, averaging 8‚Äì10 daily sunshine hours in most regions.[2] The average annual rainfall for South Africa is about 464 mm (compared to a global average of 786 mm[3]) but large and unpredictable variations are common. Overall, rainfall is greatest in the east and gradually decreases westward, with some semi-desert areas along the western edge of South Africa. For most of the country, rain falls mainly in the summer months with brief afternoon thunderstorms. The exception is the Western Cape and its capital city Cape Town where the climate is Mediterranean and it rains more in the wintertime.[4] In the winter months, snow collects on the high mountains of the Cape and the Drakensberg. </p>
<p> South Africa's coasts are major tourist attractions and trade locations. This makes the ocean important to South Africa and its citizens. The Indian and Atlantic oceans meet at the southwestern tip of South Africa. The warm Agulhas Current runs south along the east coast and the cold Benguela Current flows north along the western shore. As a result, there is at least a 6 ¬∞C difference in the annual temperatures of Durban (on the east) and Port Nolloth (on the west) despite being located at roughly the same latitude.[4] With several other parts on the interior not receiving an adequate amount of rainfall and thus prone to droughts. </p>
<p> Climatic zones are often referred to by the seasonal pattern of rainfall. The winter rainfall region is confined to a relatively small area in the south-west, the Western Cape area, where gentle rain falls from May to August but the summers are dry. The summer rainfall region is the largest, being most of the country north of the coastal areas and the north west arid desert. Rain falls from October to February and is often heavy, with the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. The summer and winter rainfall region is the Eastern Cape. The arid regions are in the north-west, with the driest areas being the north-west coast. Vegetation tends to vary by climatic zone[5] and these also correspond to the horticultural zones.[6] </p>
<p> The Highveld is the eastern plateau area of South Africa. It is typified by Johannesburg, at an elevation of 1,753 metres (5,751 ft). The former central business district is found on the south side of the prominent ridge called the Witwatersrand and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the Limpopo and Vaal Rivers. The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter. </p>
<p> Johannesburg enjoys a dry, sunny climate, with the exception of occasional late afternoon downpours in the summer months of October to April.[7] Temperatures in the city are usually fairly mild due to the city's high altitude, with the average maximum daytime temperature in January of 26 ¬∞C (78.8 ¬∞F), dropping to an average maximum of around 16 ¬∞C (60.8 ¬∞F) in June. Winter is the sunniest time of the year, with cool days and cold nights. The temperature occasionally drops to below freezing at night, causing frost. Snow is a rare occurrence, with snowfall having been experienced in May 1956, August 1962, June 1964, September 1981, August 2006 (light), on 27 June 2007,[8] accumulating up to 10 centimetres (3.9 in) in the southern suburbs, and most recently on 7 August 2012. Regular cold fronts pass over in winter bringing very cold southerly winds but usually clear skies. The annual average rainfall is 713 millimetres (28.1 in), which is mostly concentrated in the summer months. Infrequent showers occur through the course of the winter months. </p>
<p> The Western Cape province has a Mediterranean climate with warm to hot, dry, sunny summer weather and mild, rainy conditions in winter. </p>
<p> Climate change will impact agriculture in South Africa (trellised vines in Stellenbosch) </p>
<p> Climate change in South Africa is leading to increased temperatures and rainfall variability. Evidence shows that extreme weather events are becoming more prominent due to climate change.[10] This is a critical concern for South Africans as climate change will affect the overall status and wellbeing of the country, for example with regards to water resources. Just like many other parts of the world, climate research showed that the real challenge in South Africa was more related to environmental issues rather than developmental ones.[11] The most severe effect will be targeting the water supply, which has huge effects on the agriculture sector.[12] Speedy environmental changes are resulting in clear effects on the community and environmental level in different ways and aspects, starting with air quality, to temperature and weather patterns, reaching out to food security and disease burden.[13] </p>
<p> South Africa contributes considerable CO 2 emissions, being the 14th largest emitter of CO 2.[12] Above the global average, South Africa had 9.5 tons of CO 2 emissions per capita in 2015.[12] This is in large part due to its energy system relying heavily on coal and oil.[12] As part of its international commitments, South Africa has pledged to peak emissions between 2020 and 2025.[12] </p>

<p> Midday flurries to make for a cold, windy Friday </p>
<p> Morning lows are back in the teens with a light SW breeze, and we warm up to 34 by noon. Then a cold front brings flurries and a cold wind for the afternoon with temps dropping into the teens and 20s for the late afternoon. </p>
<p> It's March 10, but it feels like January with morning lows in the teens and highs only in the 20s. Thankfully it was sunny most of the day as wind chills were near 10 all day. Clouds increased late in the day and we will see flurries this evening, especially south of Milwaukee. Morning lows are back in the teens with a light SW breeze, and we warm up to 34 by noon. Then a cold front brings flurries and a cold wind for the afternoon with temps dropping into the teens and 20s for the late afternoon. </p>
<p> The wind is cold Saturday morning with lows in the single digits and wind chills to -5. Saturday is sunny, windy and cold with highs in the low to mid 20s and wind chills in the teens from a gusty NW wind at 30 mph. There is a chance for light snow Saturday night along a warm front...that could bring about a half inch of snow that quickly melts on Sunday. Gusty SW winds warm temps into the upper 40s by Sunday afternoon. Monday is near 50 with afternoon light rain, Tuesday is back in the mid 40s with a breeze off the lake, and 50s are back for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. </p>

<p> Weather Forecasting </p>
<p> Students consider how weather forecasting plays an important part in their daily lives. They learn about the history of weather forecasting ‚Äî from old weather proverbs to modern forecasting equipment ‚Äî and how improvements in weather technology have saved lives by providing advance warning of natura... </p>
<p> Students use their senses to describe the weather and predict it. After learning the basics of weather patterns, students act as state park engineers and design/build backyard weather stations to gather data so they can make real weather forecasts. </p>
<p> Introduction/Motivation </p>
<p> Everybody loves the occasional "snow day." But, can you trust the local weather service to deliver a nice blizzard on cue? Even though weather reporters would like to take credit for good weather and avoid blame for the not-so-good, all they can really do is try to report the weather as accurately as possible. Fortunately, they have advanced technology working for them, such as Doppler radar, satellite imagery and weather forecasting software programs. </p>
<p> With the advent of satellite imaging, Doppler radar and sophisticated weather modeling software, weather forecasting is becoming increasingly accurate. Jokes about the unpredictable nature of weather are still common ‚Äî "If you don't like the weather around here, wait five minutes!" ‚Äî but the local meteorologist is not quite as likely to take the blame. If it rains on your parade or picnic, that's probably because you didn't watch the latest weathercast. </p>
<p> In this activity, you are going to take a closer look at how the weather report is delivered in your area. You will keep a record to see how accurate the weather report is. At the same time, you will observe how the report is presented so you can produce a weather show for your class. In the process, you will become better acquainted with weather terminology and learn how the latest weather forecasting technology works. </p>
<p> Procedure </p>
<p> Background </p>
<p> During this activity, students gauge the accuracy of local weather reports for themselves, and at the same time observe the local weather presenter. The goal is to present their own weather report for the class. In the process, students become more familiar with weather terminology (see the Word Origins & Metaphors: Take Their Word for It! literacy activity), learn about how weather forecasting technology works, and develop presentation skills. </p>
<p> If possible, videotape one or more evening weathercasts (4-6PM) and view in class, discussing how the weather is presented. Help the students identify the segments of the broadcast, noting the use of maps and symbols (see Figure 1). Discuss the meaning of weather symbols and basic terminology used by the meteorologist. Critique the style of presentation. The objective is to prepare the students to produce their own weathercast. </p>
<p> Consider taking the students on a field trip to a local television station to see for themselves how a weather report is produced, and meet local weather personalities they have seen on TV. </p>
<p> Observing </p>
<p> Background research: Watch the evening weather report (4-6PM time slot) on your favorite local news channel for one week. Using the Weather Watcher Worksheet, record the forecast for the following day, noting the basic weather forecast description: High and low temperatures, sunny/cloudy, rainy/snowy/windy, chance for precipitation, etc. At the same time, take some notes about the presentation itself. Observe the weather reporter's presentation style. Notice how s/he uses maps and explains weather phenomena for the viewer. Learn the tricks of the trade! The following day, observe the weather and record the actual weather conditions. Was the forecast accurate? </p>
<p> Thinking </p>
<p> Weather reporters love to brag about their Doppler ‚Äì or Super Doppler or NEXRAD ‚Äì radar systems. Have you ever wondered what all the hype is about? Learn how the latest tools work: radar, satellite imaging and weather forecasting software (see the References section or search for weather forecasting technology on the Internet). </p>
<p> Writing </p>
<p> Imagine you are presenting the television weather report for the evening news (4-6PM). Prepare your script. Your report should include: </p>
<p> Today's weather ‚Äî local, state, national weather maps </p>
<p> Record high and low temperatures </p>
<p> Outlook for the evening </p>
<p> Air quality report including pollution alerts and burning restrictions </p>
<p> Tomorrow's prediction </p>
<p> Five-day forecast </p>
<p> Some interesting weather trivia or an explanation of a weather phenomenon </p>
<p> Create weather maps to use for your report. Make three maps, if possible: one for the local report (city and counties), one for a statewide report and one for the national report (often a satellite image). Make reusable symbols for high and low fronts, as well as cloud, sun, rain, snow and lightning symbols. What other props will you use? An umbrella? Raincoat? Sunglasses? Videotape your presentation if possible. </p>
<p> For extra credit, have students incorporate a lay person-level explanation of Doppler effect or Doppler shift as part of their in-class weather program presentation. </p>
<p> Vocabulary/Definitions </p>
<p> accurate: Exactly factual; errorless. </p>
<p> doppler radar: Radar that uses the Doppler effect to measure velocity of approaching weather. </p>
<p> forecast: To estimate or calculate in advance, especially to predict (weather conditions) by analysis of meteorological data. </p>
<p> front: Meteorology. The interface between air masses of different temperatures or densities. </p>
<p> satellite imagery: Pictures taken by photographic equipment mounted on satellites. </p>
<p> weathercast: A broadcast of weather conditions. </p>
<p> Assessment </p>
<p> Pre-Activity Assessment </p>
<p> Check to make sure students have completed their Weather Watcher Worksheets, both forecasts and actual data. </p>
<p> Activity Embedded Assessment </p>
<p> After introducing students to weather technology, use call-out questions or a pop quiz to reinforce vocabulary and understanding. </p>
<p> Post-Activity Assessment </p>
<p> Depending on the number of students in the class, a different student can deliver the weather forecast each day for a month and be assessed for presentation skills. The shared props for a "Weather Corner" ‚Äî items such as maps, weather symbols and other graphic images ‚Äî can be designed and assembled by the class. </p>
<p> Activity Extensions </p>
<p> Play Vivaldi's Baroque masterpiece, The Four Seasons, for the class (see Figure 2). Discuss how the music reflects the qualities of the weather from season to season. Discuss the characteristics of Baroque music. Have students write down their impressions or create a poem, drawing or watercolor to illustrate a season (see Figure 3). Weather and seasonal change are a favorite theme of poets, composers and artists alike. See How Artists See the Weather: Sun, Wind, Snow, Rain by Colleen Carroll. </p>

<p> Annual Days of Sunshine Report: Downtown Seattle vs. Olympic Rain Shadow, Oct 2010-September 2011 </p>
<p> This report is a comparison and analysis of the sunshine in downtown Seattle, Washington vs. areas, including Sequim, located in the Olympic rain shadow. The number of sunny days per year in Seattle is reasonably well understood and documented, but the corresponding data for Sequim, or for that matter, any location in the rain shadow, had not been measured to our knowledge prior to this study. We used recorded solar radiation to estimate sky conditions using a sophisticated algorithm we put together and refined during the yearly study. </p>
<p> Report Highlights: </p>
<p> Winter (Nov-Jan) saw 5X as many mostly sunny days in the shadow vs. Seattle. </p>
<p> Winter saw only 1/4 as many dreary days in the shadow vs. Seattle. </p>
<p> Spring (Feb-May) saw the highest number of rain shadow days per month, at nearly 8! </p>
<p> Summer (Jul-Sep) saw rain shadow areas and Seattle with nearly equal mostly sunny days. </p>
<p> Port Angeles was definitely *in* the rain shadow, with quite similar benefits to Sequim. </p>
<p> Report Detail: </p>
<p> Our data shows that the climate in the rain shadow was clearly brighter and sunnier than downtown Seattle, with 127 mostly sunny days vs. only 88 in Seattle, fewer cloudy days, and dramatically fewer dreary days. </p>
<p> (note, a "rainshadow" day is a cloudy or dreary day in Seattle when is it partly or mostly sunny in Sequim or Port Angeles) </p>
<p> However, it was on a seasonal basis where the more dramatic variations arose. </p>
<p> During the darkest and stormiest winter months of November through January, Sequim recorded 51 of 92 days at least partly sunny, with 20 mostly sunny days, and only 4 dreary days. During this same period in downtown Seattle, only 4 of 92 days were mostly sunny, with 19 dreary days. It is important to note that during this period, there were stretches of days where there was "not place to run, no place to hide". For example, January in Sequim was particularly bad, with only4 mostly sunny days, and 20 out of 31 days cloudy or dreary. </p>
<p> But right on the heals of January, the rain shadow really kicked into gear during the early spring months of February through April, In Sequim, 63 of 89 days were at least partly sunny. March in particular was a very stormy and dark month in Seattle, with 18 of 31 days cloudy, while Sequim recorded only 8 such days. In the typically bright ‚Äúsummer‚Äù months of July, August, and September, the rain shadow effect was at its minimum. Total mostly sunny days were close to equivalent in Sequim and Seattle, at 43 and 44 respectively. Still, even in the dry months, there were some stormy periods, especially in July and September, and the rain shadow produced 13 rain shadow days during this period. </p>
<p> While this report focuses on Sequim vs. Seattle, thanks to Lincoln High School, we also analyzed Port Angeles weather at the same level of detail as Sequim and Seattle. On an annual basis, Port Angeles recorded virtually the same number of mostly sunny days as Sequim and nearly identical the overall solar radiation; so Port Angeles is most definitely ‚Äúin the shadow‚Äù. However there were some seasonal differences between the two locations. For more detail, see our page on Port Angeles Sunshine. </p>
<p> Report Conclusion </p>
<p> The Olympic rain shadow has a dramatic impact in the amount of incident light and number of sunny days recorded in locations like Sequim when compared to downtown Seattle. The weather differences are most pronounced during the winter and spring seasons. Port Angeles also benefits strongly from the rain shadow, as do likely other areas such as Victoria, the southern San Juan Islands, and western Whidbey Island. While this study focused on downtown Seattle, it is highly likely, if not certain, that many suburban areas of Seattle, especially those to the east, are even more dramatically less sunny than Olympic rain shadow areas during the winter and early spring. </p>
<p> The studies and live sunshine conditions on this website are based on examining incident solar radiation. Solar radiation is measured in watts per square meter (w/m^2). Solar radiation is directly related to illuminance, a measure of how much light falls on a given area. </p>
<p> Live sunshine conditions are calculated as follows: </p>
<p> ‚ÄúBright Sunshine‚Äù sensors record at least 60% of the maximum radiation possible for that day of that year ‚ÄúPartial Sunshine‚Äù sensors record between 20% and 60% of the maximum radiation for that day of that year ‚ÄúGray‚Äù sensors record between 50 w/m^2 and 20% of the maximum radiation for that day of that year ‚ÄúDark Gray‚Äù sensors record between 1 and 49 w/m^2 </p>
<p> Days are categorized as follows: </p>
<p> "Mostly Sunny" over ÔøΩ the day had at least ‚Äúpartial sunshine‚Äù, with at least 22% of daylight hours ‚Äúbright sunshine‚Äù. "Partly Sunny" over ÔøΩ the day had at least ‚Äúpartial sunshine‚Äù, but less than 22% of daylight hours ‚Äúbright sunshine‚Äù. "Overcast" over ÔøΩ the day had gray or dark gray skies, but at least 22% of daylight hours ‚Äúgray‚Äù. "Dreary" daylight hours predominately dark gray, with less then 22% of daylight hours ‚Äúgray‚Äù. </p>
<p> The website uses data from four different weather stations. </p>
<p> The first station, the Sequim station, is located on the roof of a single story home on Jamestown Beach Rd, in Sequim, directly on the shores of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. This location may be very close to the epicenter of the Olympic Rain Shadow. As with many locations on the Dungeness plain in Sequim, this one is not shaded by tall trees, nor does it have any hills affecting its exposure. When the sun rises in the morning, it clears the horizon almost immediately as the areas to the south and east are open water. When the sun sets in the evening, it sets to the west, over the Dungeness plain, so stays above the horizon for quite some time. The Sequim location uses a Davis Instruments Vantage Pro 2 with optional solar sensor. This station measures solar radiation every 2 minutes and records the average over 10 minutes. </p>
<p> The second station is in downtown Port Angeles, at Lincoln High School. The school's Davis Instruments Vantage Pro2 Plus sensors are mounted on the rooftop of the high school, about a mile southwest of ferry dock to Victoria B.C. at an elevation of about 200 feet. There is excellent exposure clockwise from northeast to southwest and good exposure for the other directions. The sensors record solar radiation every five minutes. Special thanks to Peter Alexander, his math classes, and Lincoln High School for the data and support.. </p>
<p> The third station is atop the Atmospheric Sciences Department building of the University of Washington, in the University District of Seattle. This seven story building is not in the classical Olympic Rain Shadow area, but is still slightly shadowed by the Olympics. Given that the sensor is located atop a tall building, this location has ideal exposure and receives maximum solar radiation. This station records solar radiation every minute. Data was retrieved by downloading public information from the University of Washington‚Äôs Department of Atmospheric Sciences website. </p>
<p> The fourth station is in downtown Port Townsend at a private residence. The Davis Instruments Vantage Pro 2 Plus with option solar sensor is located on the roof of the home and has clear exposure to all directions. It elevation is roughly 100 feet above sea level, and it is about 1/4 mile from the shoreline. </p>
<p> For the year long study, we made a number of improvements to our model which estimates sky conditions from solar radiation. First, we and others noticed that the UW equipment in Seattle was uniformly recording lower radiation than the two other stations, even on completely clear, sunny days. So we normalized the radiation on the Y axis such that that all stations were recording nearly identical radiation on clear sunny days. This reduced, but in no way eliminated, the advantage rain shadow locations had over Seattle. </p>
<p> Next, we made our seasonality model much more sophisticated. Originally, we used radiation and "bright sunny hours" thresholds computed on a monthly basis to estimate sunny days. The problem is those thresholds are very different at the beginning of a month like February than at the end. So we moved to a daily threshold for these values, which is much more accurate. This change made the model more accurate, but did not change overall comparative results dramatically. </p>
<p> Finally we compared our model's results for Seattle to the National Weather Service evaluations of average daily sky conditions to check for consistency. The weather service categorizes days as on average as, "Cloudy", "Partly Cloudy", or "Clear", based on automated hourly observations. We found that our totals for cloudy, and the sum of partly and mostly sunny days, lined up quite well with their observations; however, our category of "mostly sunny" is a little broader than their category of "Clear". Overall though, the consistency was encouraging. Of course the weather service only does sky condition summaries for a small number of cities, none in locations such as Sequim, Port Townsend, or Anacortes, so that is why we went with the radiation approach. </p>

<p> Today (Monday): While it was decidedly chilly the past two days, the conclusion to the holiday weekend could not be much better. Beautiful sunshine pushes highs up to 60 degrees ‚Äî possibly a little higher in our southern areas. Winds are from the south around 10 mph with gusts of 15 to 20 mph. Confidence: High </p>

<p> Tomorrow (Tuesday): Although it‚Äôs mild, you‚Äôll want to carry an umbrella as the chance of rain increases in the morning and precipitation becomes likely by afternoon. Temperatures are above average, with highs 60 to 65. Winds are from the south around 15 mph with gusts of 20 to 30 mph. Rainfall should be mostly light, with daytime totals of 0.1 to 0.25 inches. Confidence: Medium-High </p>
<p> Story continues below advertisement </p>
<p> Tomorrow night: We may see rain ease in the evening and then stop overnight, but it remains warm. Temperatures drop only to 55 to 60 degrees as steady winds from the south continue to draw in mild air. Confidence: Medium-High </p>
<p> A look ahead </p>
<p> Another wave of rain may pass early Wednesday, which should move off by midday or so. As temperatures rise to near 70 degrees, we‚Äôll have a chance to enjoy a few hours of springlike weather in the afternoon. Turning colder Wednesday night, with lows 35 to 40 as a cold front will have passed through the region. Confidence: Medium </p>

<p> Increasing clouds on Thursday with rain likely. Some of our colder areas well west and northwest of the Beltway could get a wintry mix. Temperatures probably hold in the 30s to near 40. Rain, except maybe some patchy icy precipitation in our colder areas, may continue Thursday night and even into early Friday. During the day Friday, we could see some lingering rain in the morning before skies partially clear, with highs 50 to 55. Confidence: Medium </p>
<p> Story continues below advertisement </p>
<p> Friday night and Saturday look dry but cold. Lows early Saturday are near 30, with highs in the afternoon only about 40 amid partly sunny skies. Confidence: Medium-High </p>
<p> There‚Äôs a small chance that a wave of low pressure tracks through the region Sunday, bringing a chance of wet snow. But the majority of computer models keep us dry. We‚Äôre leaning toward the drier forecast for now amid highs in the mid-40s, but stay tuned for possible changes. Confidence: Low-Medium </p>

<p> DeepMind‚Äôs AI predicts almost exactly when and where it‚Äôs going to rain </p>
<p> The firm worked with UK weather forecasters to create a model that was better at making short term predictions than existing systems. </p>
<p> First protein folding, now weather forecasting: London-based AI firm DeepMind is continuing its run applying deep learning to hard science problems. Working with the Met Office, the UK‚Äôs national weather service, DeepMind has developed a deep-learning tool called DGMR that can accurately predict the likelihood of rain in the next 90 minutes‚Äîone of weather forecasting‚Äôs toughest challenges. </p>
<p> In a blind comparison with existing tools, several dozen experts judged DGMR‚Äôs forecasts to be the best across a range of factors‚Äîincluding its predictions of the location, extent, movement, and intensity of the rain‚Äî89% of the time. The results were published in a Nature paper today. </p>
<p> Forecasting rain, especially heavy rain, is crucial for a lot of industries, from outdoor events to aviation to emergency services. But doing it well is hard. Figuring out how much water is in the sky, and when and where it‚Äôs going to fall, depends on a number of weather processes, such as changes in temperature, cloud formation, and wind. All these factors are complex enough by themselves, but they‚Äôre even more complex when taken together. </p>
<p> The best existing forecasting techniques use massive computer simulations of atmospheric physics. These work well for longer-term forecasting but are less good at predicting what‚Äôs going to happen in the next hour or so, known as nowcasting. Previous deep-learning techniques have been developed, but these typically do well at one thing, such as predicting location, at the expense of something else, such as predicting intensity. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúThe nowcasting of precipitation remains a substantial challenge for meteorologists,‚Äù says Greg Carbin, chief of forecast operations at the NOAA Weather Prediction Center in the US, who was not involved in the work. </p>
<p> The DeepMind team trained their AI on radar data. Many countries release frequent snapshots throughout the day of radar measurements that track the formation and movement of clouds. In the UK, for example, a new reading is released every five minutes. Putting these snapshots together provides an up-to-date stop-motion video that shows how rain patterns are moving across a country, similar to the forecast visuals you see on TV. </p>
<p> The researchers fed this data to a deep generative network, similar to a GAN‚Äîa kind of AI that is trained to generate new samples of data that are very similar to the real data it was trained on. GANs have been used to generate fake faces, even fake Rembrandts. In this case, DGMR (which stands for ‚Äúdeep generative model of rainfall‚Äù) learned to generate fake radar snapshots that continued the sequence of actual measurements. It‚Äôs the same idea as seeing a few frames of a movie and guessing what‚Äôs going to come next, says Shakir Mohamed, who led the research at DeepMind. </p>
<p> To test the approach, the team asked 56 weather forecasters at the Met Office (who were not otherwise involved in the work) to rate DGMR in a blind comparison with forecasts made by a state-of-the-art physics simulation and a rival deep-learning tool; 89% said that they preferred the results given by DGMR. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúMachine-learning algorithms generally try and optimize for one simple measure of how good its prediction is,‚Äù says Niall Robinson, head of partnerships and product innovation at the Met Office, who coauthored the study. ‚ÄúHowever, weather forecasts can be good or bad in lots of different ways. Perhaps one forecast gets precipitation in the right location but at the wrong intensity, or another gets the right mix of intensities but in the wrong places, and so on. We went to a lot of effort in this research to assess our algorithm against a wide suite of metrics.‚Äù </p>
<p> DeepMind‚Äôs collaboration with the Met Office is a good example of AI development done in collaboration with the end user, something that seems like an obviously good idea but often does not happen. The team worked on the project for several years, and input from the Met Office‚Äôs experts shaped the project. ‚ÄúIt pushed our model development in a different way than we would have gone down on our own,‚Äù says Suman Ravuri, a research scientist at DeepMind. ‚ÄúOtherwise we might have made a model that was ultimately not particularly useful.‚Äù </p>
<p> DeepMind is also eager to demonstrate that its AI has practical applications.. For Shakir, DGMR is part of the same story as AlphaFold: the company is cashing in on its years of solving hard problems in games. Perhaps the biggest takeaway here is that DeepMind is finally starting to tick off a bucket list of real-world science problems. </p>

<p> Though it almost certainly won‚Äôt work, it is a telling sign of where the field is heading </p>
<p> OpenAI has trained its flagship language model to follow instructions, making it spit out less unwanted text‚Äîbut there's still a way to go. </p>
<p> The words people used to describe their trip experiences could lead to better drugs to treat mental illness. </p>
<p> The prospect of unlimited clean energy is still a long way off, but this is another example of DeepMind tackling hard real-world problems. </p>

<p> The Met Office has predicted a "very warm" weekend for Devon as part of a South West weather forecast. Temperatures as high as 18 degrees are to be expected today (March 26). </p>
<p> The Exeter-based forecaster has said we should expect a "fine and dry" Saturday with largely sunny skies. Sunday is also looking to be fine and dry. </p>
<p> The Met Office forecast says: "Any patchy fog readily clears on Saturday morning leaving a fine and dry day with largely sunny skies and small amounts of fair weather cloud. Feeling very warm once again. Maximum temperature 18¬∞C." </p>
<p> From Sunday to Tuesday the Met Office said: "Another fine, dry day on Sunday with sunny spells. Cooler with bright spells on Monday, but staying dry. Cloudier on Tuesday with the chance of a few showers." </p>
<p> Last week the Met Office said parts of Devon were hotter than Ibiza and Cyprus. Among them was Barnstaple, with the North Devon town set for more glorious sunshine. This means that the town will be warmer than Ibiza and Cyprus' capital city Nicosia, with both these locations which are havens for sunny weather lovers only touching 16¬∞C. </p>
<p> Exeter and Tiverton was slightly warmer with temperatures the same as in Ibiza and Nicosia. </p>

<p> Explainer: Weather and weather prediction </p>
<p> It only seems like the weather forecaster on TV is doing a bad job </p>
<p> Share this: </p>
<p> Weather is one of those things that you don‚Äôt really notice until it somehow affects your life directly, usually in a bad way. A thunderstorm rains out the baseball game. A hurricane floods a town. A blizzard closes school. OK, it‚Äôs not always bad. </p>
<p> Kevin Petty is a meteorologist and chief scientific officer for Vaisala, in Louisville, Colo. The company provides weather-related observations and software to governments and other groups to help guide their decision-making. He describes weather as the atmospheric conditions that occur in a place over a relatively short period of time. It‚Äôs the rain that comes through on a summer day. Or the cold that makes you wear a coat in winter. </p>
<p> But where does weather come from? The sun provides energy that drives the weather. Other features also play a role. These include Earth‚Äôs oceans, its land cover, the chemistry of its atmosphere and the planet‚Äôs rotation. If any of those were different, we would experience very different weather patterns. And if the planet was just a bare rock orbiting a star, there would be no weather at all. </p>
<p> Not so long ago in human history, weather was just something that happened. People would know generally what to expect from season to season. A region‚Äôs climate ‚Äî the long-term average of weather ‚Äî didn‚Äôt tend to vary much from year to year. People might know to expect snow in winter, for instance, and hot weather in summer. But they wouldn‚Äôt know if it would snow on any particular day or whether some July drought would develop, putting fields of wheat at risk. </p>

<p> There was a problem signing you up. </p>
<p> Today, you need only turn on the TV or pull out your phone to have a prediction for what the upcoming weather will be. ‚ÄúPeople always say the weather guy is wrong,‚Äù notes Petty, ‚Äúwhich is not really true.‚Äù Some of that is psychological. ‚ÄúWe never fault the weather guy when it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ beautiful outside,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe only notice when the forecast goes wrong.‚Äù </p>
<p> And yes, sometimes the weather forecaster gets it wrong. Scientists have understood the basic physics behind the weather for more than a century. But they required computer models and reliable weather data to turn that knowledge into reliable forecasts. Today, computers take that knowledge of what Earth is like and use it to predict the weather. And that‚Äôs one of the reasons why forecasts aren‚Äôt always right ‚Äî there just aren‚Äôt enough data for those computer models to work with. </p>
<p> Areas like the United States are generally well-covered with weather stations and with meteorologists who send weather balloons into the atmosphere to collect data. But there are a lot fewer of these over the oceans and in less populated places, such as deserts, as well as poorer countries. </p>
<p> As more reliable data have become available, computing resources have gotten better, computer models have improved and weather predictions have improved. ‚ÄúIf you look over the last four to five decades, our ability to forecast the weather has improved dramatically,‚Äù Petty says. Three-day forecasts are around 98 percent accurate worldwide. That‚Äôs according to a 2016 review in Nature. In 1981, they had been less than 90 percent accurate in the Northern Hemisphere and less than 80 percent accurate in the South. Ten-day forecasts weren‚Äôt even introduced until the mid-1990s. They are now around 40 percent accurate. </p>
<p> Story continues below image. </p>
<p> Good forecasts have proven even more important in preparing for extreme weather. Meteorologists can now forecast the intensity of a hurricane ‚Äî and its potential track ‚Äî days in advance. And people in the path of tornadoes now can get far more warning of potential danger than they did just 20 years ago. </p>
<p> Scientists are working to improve forecasts even more. Because of the complexity of Earth‚Äôs system, computer models still can‚Äôt simulate everything going on with the planet. And that limits the accuracy of forecasts, Petty notes. There also still is a need for better observations in parts of the world where weather stations are few and far between. </p>
<p> But weather forecasts, imperfect as they sometimes seem, already are a key piece of knowledge in today‚Äôs world. They let cities, counties and states plan where and when to position snowplows before a snowstorm. Electric companies know which days their wind farms will produce the most energy. Forecasts help airlines route planes around hurricanes and thunderstorms and decide when their planes will need de-icer applied to their wings. And of course, they let kids plan ahead for snow days! </p>

<p> 2022 Bahrain GP Weather Prediction: Extreme Winds Set to Wreak Havoc Over New-Era F1 Cars </p>
<p> Published 03/17/2022, 4:00 PM CET </p>
<p> F1 returns to action this weekend as it hosts the beginning of a new era in Bahrain. The new 2022 regulations will be in effect from this weekend as we will see new cars going full tilt and teams working under a budget cap. Everyone is excited to watch the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday after the controversial and brilliant end to the 2021 season. </p>

<p> But the weekend looks to be a tricky one for the new generation of cars. As we have seen in the official pre-season test, the new 2022 cars are very sensitive to windy conditions. And according to F1 journalist Jennie Gow, the wind will be at full tilt at the Sakhir International Circuit this race weekend. </p>
<p> Gow took to social media to provide a weather update ahead of the start of the weekend. </p>
<p> Conditions in Bahrain are exceptionally windy üå¨ Not sure #F1 cars will like that so much!! Good exfoliation session incoming‚Ä¶ üòÉ </p>
<p> ‚ÄúConditions in Bahrain are exceptionally windy. Not sure #F1 cars will like that so much!! Good exfoliation session incoming‚Ä¶‚Äù wrote Gow. </p>
<p> As reported by Formula1.com, there would be heavy winds throughout the weekend but there is a 0% chance of rain interruption. Below is what the weekend temperatures and weather forecasts look like: </p>
<p> Friday: 23 degrees max. Sunny and dry all day long. Remaining hazy with rising sand in places. Significant northerly wind with gusts up to 40-50kph. </p>
<p> Saturday: 25 degrees celsius. Sunny and dry all day long. Moderate northerly wind with gusts up to 30-40kph during the day, easing down around dusk. </p>
<p> Sunday: 27 degrees celsius. Sunny and dry all day long. Light-to-moderate northerly wind with gusts up to 30kph in the afternoon. </p>
<p> Kevin Magnussen to make his Haas F1 return this weekend </p>
<p> ADVERTISEMENT </p>
<p> Article continues below this ad </p>
<p> Bahrain GP would be the first opportunity for Kevin Magnussen to get back behind the wheel of an F1 car in a race situation since 2020. The Haas F1 driver was elated when it was informed that he would race in the 2022 season. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúIt means a lot [to be back]. Formula 1 is the pinnacle of motorsport, and it has been my dream ever since I was a little kid. I had no idea I was even on the radar of coming back to Formula 1, and then this situation happens, and I get the drive. That just feels super cool,‚Äù said Magnussen. </p>
<p> It would be interesting to see how the Danish driver fares in his return to the sport. He had just a session and a half in the new 2022 Haas and would likely take a couple of races before reaching his full potential. But every F1 fan is excited to see how he performs come Sunday in Bahrain. </p>

<p> Facts About the Weather </p>
<p> We will learn about the facts about the weather in different weather and how the weather changes. </p>
<p> Our day may start bright and sunny but soon it may turn windy or cloudy. This is called a change in weather. Weather is a condition of the atmosphere. Weather may be hot or cold, wet or dry. Weather keeps on changing and the facts about the weather changes depends on the sun, wind, clouds and rain. </p>
<p> The Sun (sunny weather): </p>
<p> The position of the sun in the sky affects weather. The sun gives us heat. So, days are hotter than nights. In the mornings and evenings the weather is not hot. The rays of the sun are less hot. </p>
<p> At noon, when the sun is overhead the weather is the hottest. The rays of the sun are hot. </p>
<p> During summer, the weather is very hot. During winter, the weather is cold. A bright sunshine indicates sunny weather. </p>
<p> Winds (windy weather): </p>
<p> We know moving air is called wind. Wind also affects weather. When the wind blows gently, the weather is said to be breezy. Strong winds cause windy weather. </p>
<p> Very strong winds cause stormy weather. This causes damage to life and property. </p>
<p> In summer, the wind is hot or warm. We feel hot and sweaty. In winter, the wind is cold. We feel cold. </p>
<p> Clouds (cloudy weather): </p>
<p> The hot rays of the sun and winds together, turn the surface water from ponds or lakes into water vapor. This process is called evaporation. This water vapor rises upwards. It cools to form clouds. </p>
<p> When the skies are full of clouds, the weather is said to be cloudy. Only some dark clouds bring rain. </p>
<p> On cloudy days, the rays of the sun cannot reach the land. Thus, the weather is cooler on cloudy days than on sunny days. Though days are cool, the nights are warm during cloudy weather. </p>
<p> The rain (rainy weather): </p>
<p> Water vapor in the sky cools to form clouds. When these clouds get heavy with water droplets, we get rain. The air is cool and humid during rainy weather. </p>
<p> We know that the weather keeps changing throughout the year. In some months, it is very hot. In some months, it is very cold and in some months it rains heavily. </p>
<p> How do we feel when the Sun is directly overhead and if hot then why? We feel very hot because the Sun shines brightly and warms the Earth. In evening, when the Sun goes down we do not feel so hot. The Sun, air and water vapour in air control the weather. Mostly mornings are cool, afternoons are hot and evenings are cool. </p>

<p> February had twice as much rain as in the average year but it was also sunny and the temperature was higher than normal, weather bureau Weeronline said on Saturday. </p>
<p> With just three days to go, Weeronline said an average of 117 millimetres of rain fell during the month, compared with 60 millimetres in a normal year. In some places, however, the amount of rain topped 200 millimetres. </p>
<p> Force 9 wind speeds were recorded on seven different days, thanks to the storms, and there were two days with winds of up to force 11, Weeronline said. </p>
<p> But it was also warm for the time of year, with an average temperature of 6.9 Celsius, and sunny with 102 hours of sun, 10 more than in the average February. </p>
<p> There was also very little frost. Adding the expected night frosts on Saturday and Sunday to the total, there will have been just five days on which the temperature dipped below zero. </p>

<p> FIRST ALERT: Windy weekend; Warmer next week before rain returns </p>
<p> Gusts over 30 mph are very likely on Saturday as it stays on the cool side this weekend </p>
<p> ATLANTA, Ga. (CBS46) - Cool weather rules through the weekend in north Georgia. Look for temperatures to run 5-10¬∞ colder than normal from Friday through Sunday. The wind will be a factor in making it feel cooler, and there is a First Alert for strong winds on Saturday. </p>
<p> Friday Forecast </p>
<p> High Temperature: 63¬∞ </p>
<p> Normal High: 68¬∞ </p>
<p> Chance of rain: 0% </p>
<p> Partly to mostly cloudy and breezy in the afternoon. 10-20 mph with a few gusts over 25 mph. Temperature likely stays in the 50s in north Georgia. Low 60s from Atlanta to the south and east. Partly cloudy to mainly clear at night with lows in the low to mid 40s. </p>
<p> First Alert for strong winds on Saturday </p>
<p> We will see a lot of sunshine on Saturday, but it will be a cool and windy day. There is a First Alert for strong winds from midday through the afternoon. The wind will gust over 30 mph, and may reach 35-40 mph at times. The low temperature Saturday morning will be in the 40s, and the high will range from the mid 50s northwest of Atlanta and in the mountains to the low 60s from Atlanta to the southeast. </p>
<p> Expect a cold night on Saturday. The low temperature in the Atlanta metro area will be in the mid to upper 30s. It may be near freezing in the mountains under clear skies. The wind will diminish, but likely not go calm overnight. You may want to cover or bring in plants/vegetation that are susceptible to cold temps. It will be sunny, breezy and cool Sunday afternoon. </p>
<p> Warm-up before another First Alert next week </p>
<p> The weather stays dry in the early to midweek. It will reach the mid to upper 60s on Monday with partly cloudy skies. Highs will be well into the 70s on Tuesday - if there‚Äôs enough sun it may get to 80¬∞. It has a better chance of reaching 80¬∞ on Wednesday with a blend of clouds and sun. There is another First Alert for rain and storms Wednesday night into Thursday as a front moves through north Georgia. </p>

<p> For every 100 forecasts with a "low" probability, there are about less than 30 times with an average accumulated rainfall of 10 mm or above in actual observation. </p>
<p> The accuracy of forecast generally decreases while the error generally increases with forecast period. For forecast elements in "9-day Weather Forecast" other than PSR, the average accuracy for the next one to three days, four to seven days, and eight to nine days are about 90%, 85% and 80% respectively. The errors of PSR forecast in the next one to six days are within around 10% and those in seven to nine days are within around 20%. </p>
<p> The accuracy and error of forecast also vary for different weather systems in different seasons. Generally speaking, weather in spring and summer such as fog, tropical cyclone and severe convective weather is more changeable, resulting in higher uncertainty of forecast. </p>

<p> The National Weather Service issued forecasts for sky condition, temperature, wind and precipitation on a routine basis. The terminology used in these forecasts is quite variable. Listed below are descriptors of regularly used weather terms and their meanings to help give a better understanding of each forecast. </p>
<p> Sky Condition </p>
<p> The sky condition describes the predominant/average sky cover based on percent of the sky covered by opaque (not transparent) clouds. If a high probability of precipitation (60% or greater) is expected, then the sky condition may be omitted since it is inferred from the precipitation forecast. </p>
<p> Temperature </p>
<p> The temperature in a forecast is used to describe the forecast maximum and minimum temperature, or in some cases, the temperature at a specific time. </p>
<p> Wind </p>
<p> The wind describes the prevailing direction from which the wind is blowing with speeds in miles per hour. The wind forecast is included in the first three periods of the zone forecast. </p>
<p> Light/ light and variable wind </p>
<p> Very Windy </p>
<p> Strong, dangerous, high, damaging (High Wind Warning Criteria) </p>
<p> Precipitation Probability </p>
<p> The probability of precipitation (POP), is defined as the likelihood of occurrence (expressed as a percent) of a measurable amount of liquid precipitation (or the water equivalent of frozen precipitation) during a specified period of time at any given point in the forecast area. Measurable precipitation is equal to or greater than 0.01 inches. Unless specified otherwise, the time period is normally 12 hours. The forecast area, or zone, is generally considered to be a county. NWS forecasters use such categorical terms as occasional, intermittent, or periods of to describe a precipitation event that has a high probability of occurrence (80%+), but is expected to be of an "on and off" nature. </p>

<p> Friday brings occasional high clouds to an otherwise sunny Portland day; high 57 </p>
<p> Early Friday morning temperatures were cool with some spots hovering right around freezing as of 5 a.m., but temperatures will warm up nicely under mostly clear skies in Portland, hitting about 57 by the afternoon. </p>
<p> The National Weather Service says high pressure will remain in place over southwest Washington and northwest Oregon through the day but begin to break down overnight. </p>
<p> Friday‚Äôs high will bring a springlike feel to the end of the work week, but don‚Äôt get used to it. Mid and high level clouds will begin to move in by the late afternoon ahead of a wet front set to hit the coast overnight. </p>
<p> The first in an expected series of low pressure systems will bring rain and strong winds to the metro area later Saturday morning. It‚Äôs likely rain will hold off until about 10 a.m. before becoming fairly steady the rest of the day. Portland will see cloudy skies all day, and strong winds overnight. The high will be around 55 degrees. </p>
<p> Latest WPC forecast charts show the Southeast and the Pacific Northwest will be most susceptible to heavy precip. for the next 7 days. An intense storm is forecast to bring heavy snow across the interior Northeast on Sat., with high winds and rain up the East Coast. pic.twitter.com/QqF3cuDDH1 </p>
<p> ‚Äî NWS Weather Prediction Center (@NWSWPC) March 10, 2022 </p>
<p> Snow levels will rise to about 3,500 feet by Saturday afternoon, bringing the chance of a decent round of new accumulations in the upper Cascades on the weekend. </p>
<p> There‚Äôs also the potential of high winds along the coast. The weather service has issued a high wind watch in the central Oregon coast, with gusts of 60-65 mph likely from Saturday afternoon through the evening. Other parts of the coast will be windy as well, but gusts may stay below advisory level. </p>
<p> Areas of the Willamette Valley could see a 3-6 hour burst of strong winds with gusts of up to 50 mph late Saturday and into Sunday morning. </p>
<p> Sunday will bring more rain to the metro area, with showers expected throughout the day. High temperatures will hit about 54 degrees. Total rainfall from the weekend could add up to an inch in the valleys, and as much as two inches in the Coast Range. </p>
<p> Extended forecasts aren‚Äôt in full agreement, but most show heavy rain at times Monday, then showers well into the week. </p>

<p> This section offers the most important data to study when predicting heavy rain. Each factor will be presented as well as its importance to heavy rain forecasting. </p>
<p> 1. Precipitable water: </p>
<p> Precipitable water is the amount of water that would fall to the surface if all moisture in the atmosphere were brought down to the surface. The value can be found by either finding the data from a Skew-T or located a precipitable water chart. Precipitable water values less than 0.75 inches are considered relatively low while greater than 1.5 relatively high. The value must be compared with the climatology of a region. A vegetated region will support higher values of precipitable water than a semi-desert region. Precipitable water should not be used to predict an exact rain total since moisture convergence can enhance the amount of moisture that has the potential to fall over an area. Higher PW values are maximized when surface dewpoints are high and the atmosphere is near saturation through a large depth of the atmosphere. Often the precipitable water value will be given with a percent of climatology value. If the percent of climatology value is above 150%, this is an indication heavy prolonged rain will produce flooding in that region. </p>
<p> 2. Moisture convergence: </p>
<p> Quasi-stationary trigger mechanisms can force moisture into the same area for a prolonged period of time. Examples include stalled fronts and a near stationary mid-latitude cyclone. As long as moisture is supplied into the stationary trigger mechanism it will continue to rain. </p>
<p> 3. Stalled Trigger mechanism: </p>
<p> Slow movement of fronts or tropical systems that have heavy rain already associated with them will continue to produce heavy rain over the same areas. Trigger mechanisms such as fronts will begin to stall if upper level winds are nearly parallel to the surface trigger mechanism. </p>
<p> 4. Deep level of moisture: </p>
<p> This is related to a high precipitable water if a deep layer of moisture exists in warm and humid air. The lifting of a deep layer of moisture has the potential to produce heavy rain. In the US, this can occur from a deep layer of Gulf moisture banking up against a slow moving trigger mechanism. </p>
<p> 5. Saturated Soil and Snow Melt: </p>
<p> Once soils have exceeded their capacity to capture water, rainfall after this point will lead to runoff. Soils can be saturated from rain in a previous storm system or a prolonged rain event from one storm system. Snow melt adds to the amount of runoff. Heavy rain combined with rapid snowmelt is conducive to flash flooding. </p>
<p> 6. Frozen soil and very dry soil: </p>
<p> Frozen soil acts like saturated soil. All rainfall will immediately runoff. The pore spaces in very dry soil do not allow water to penetrate at a quick rate. Very heavy rain on bone dry soil can caused flooding. This occurs with heavy convective thunderstorms over arid and semi-arid regions. </p>
<p> 7. Weak winds aloft: </p>
<p> Weak winds aloft do not allow thunderstorms or fronts to move very quickly. This can produce local or widespread heavy rain. </p>

<p> Heavy rain forecast to hit Hawke's Bay and Gisborne next week </p>
<p> Marty Sharpe15:46, Mar 11 2022 </p>
<p> Heavy rain in Gisborne and northern Hawke‚Äôs Bay is likely early next week, with coastal indundation a possibility after. </p>
<p> MetService on Friday said a low was forecast to approach the North Island from the northeast and may become slow moving just to the northeast of East Cape on Tuesday, then move away to the southeast late Wednesday. </p>
<p> This system is expected to direct a moist south to southeast flow over central and northern parts of New Zealand. The strength of the associated winds and amount of rainfall expected is dependent on the position and intensity of the low. </p>
<p> There was some uncertainty about the low‚Äôs track and intensity, but there was the potential for significant rainfall in Gisborne and Hawke‚Äôs Bay, and severe gales in parts of the lower North Island and Marlborough Sounds, MetService said. </p>
<p> On Monday and Tuesday, MetService had high confidence of rainfall in amounts exceeding warning criteria in Gisborne and the Wairoa District. This would reduce to moderate rainfall on Wednesday. </p>
<p> On Tuesday and Wednesday, there was low confidence of warning amounts of rain for eastern parts of Taihape and the remainder of Hawke‚Äôs Bay. </p>
<p> For Wairarapa, there was low confidence of warning amounts of rain on Wednesday. </p>
<p> There was also low confidence of severe gale south to southeasterly winds in exposed parts of the lower North Island from Taranaki across to eastern Bay of Plenty southwards, and also for the Marlborough Sounds, on Tuesday and Wednesday as depicted on the chart. </p>
<p> On Tuesday and Wednesday there was a possibility of large waves and coastal inundation in Hawke‚Äôs Bay and Gisborne. </p>

<p> Heavy rain and gusty winds douse Portland on Monday; high 56 </p>
<p> A slow-moving low pressure system spinning over the north Pacific will send an atmospheric river into the Pacific Northwest over the next few days. </p>
<p> The National Weather Service says the narrow front is holding strong moisture and moving slowly as it brings periods of moderate to heavy rain Monday through Wednesday. </p>
<p> The heaviest rainfall is likely to hit the higher terrain of southwest Washington and the northern Oregon Coast Range on Monday. Rain rates could be as high as a half inch per hour. Some river flooding is a concern along the Grays and Naselle rivers, both in Washington. Travel along the coast may be difficult at times Monday and Tuesday as rainfall will be heavy and strong winds are likely along the beaches and headlands. Use caution in those areas. </p>
<p> After slogging through a wet Sunday, Portland will see more rain Monday with standing water on roadways and gusty winds at times. Wind gusts could reach as strong as 35 mph. The high will be near 56 degrees. </p>
<p> A slow moving low pressure spinning over the north Pacific will result in an atmospheric river (a narrow ribbon of enhanced moisture transport) slowly shifting across the PacNW. This will produce periods of moderate to heavy rain to begin the work week. #pdxtst #orwx #wawx pic.twitter.com/IW6yOxvKwY </p>
<p> After a slight lull in precipitation later Monday afternoon or evening, Tuesday will be another wet day with rain likely throughout the morning. The high will be about 57 degrees. </p>
<p> Rain continues Wednesday as the slow-moving front finally heads east across the Cascades. Post-frontal showers will remain into the evening. The high will dip to about 53 degrees as high temperatures begin to cool. </p>
<p> The mountains are not going to see any new snowfall from this system as freezing levels will rise from about 5,000 feet early Monday to as high as 8,000 feet through Tuesday night. Some area ski resorts, including Timberline and Mt. Hood Meadows, closed their lifts Monday due to high winds and rainy conditions. Check with your favorite area before heading up Monday or Tuesday. An avalanche warning was also issued over the weekend in the Washington Cascades. </p>
<p> Extended forecasts are showing colder air moving back into the region by Thursday. The Cascades could see a little new snowfall late Wednesday night but by then, the bulk of the rain will have moved east. </p>
<p> Rainy and Windy along the coast tonight into Monday. Strongest winds will be late tonight through Monday morning. Ensure loose items are secured or stored away. Otherwise, Mother Nature will move those for you. #orwx #wawx pic.twitter.com/WRV7hZB1wf </p>

<p> Places like Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Jackson, Mississippi, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama, are all under a level 4 out of 5 risk for severe weather on Wednesday. </p>
<p> This includes the risk of significant winds (gusts over 75 mph), large hail and the possibility of strong tornadoes (EF-2 or stronger). </p>
<p> New Orleans, Memphis, Nashville and Montgomery are all under a level 3 out of 5 risk for severe weather. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúAll the ingredients are there for a severe weather event,‚Äù said the National Weather Service (NWS) office in New Orleans. </p>
<p> Adding that ‚ÄúQLCS tornadoes are a definite possibility.‚Äù QLCS stands for Quasi-linear convective system, which produces tornadoes within a line of storms. </p>
<p> They can spin up quickly with little warning. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) also noted in its forecast discussion that the ‚Äúfast storm motion could result in longer-track QLCS tornadoes than are typically observed.‚Äù </p>
<p> This means that the tornadoes could stay on the ground longer than usual. </p>
<p> The SPC mentions that these tornadoes could be EF-2 or potentially stronger within this line of storms. </p>
<p> First Dallas is at risk for severe storms again on Tuesday </p>
<p> These storms are pushing east from the Plains, which on Tuesday will create a slight risk ‚Äî level 2 of 5 ‚Äî of storms from Texas to Iowa. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúSevere thunderstorms are expected mainly this evening and tonight, from the lower Missouri Valley region to central Texas,‚Äù the SPC said. </p>
<p> Winds and hail are the main threats but a few tornadoes also will be possible, especially in Texas and Oklahoma. </p>
<p> These storms will roll east through the night and strengthen during the day Wednesday. </p>
<p> Debris from last week‚Äôs storms could create more hazards </p>
<p> As these storms move into the Lower Mississippi River Valley by midday, very strong winds will enter the region ahead of the main line of storms. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúSome gusts are expected to be 50+mph (not associated with the line of storms),‚Äù said the NWS office in New Orleans in their forecast discussion. </p>
<p> Once the storms reach the Baton Rouge/New Orleans area, the winds within the storm system could gust to 70 mph or higher. This could result in falling trees and power outages. </p>
<p> The New Orleans area is still cleaning up from last week‚Äôs deadly EF-3 tornado and damaging EF-1 tornado. According to Lauren Nash at the NWS office in New Orleans, some streets are still lined with debris, which could become incredibly dangerous when you add 70 mph storm winds. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúWhenever you have that 60-70 mile per hour wind, it‚Äôs going to pick up a lot of that debris,‚Äù Nash told CNN Monday. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs important to stay inside when we have a wind advisory out and if we do have warnings in effect, just go into an interior room.‚Äù </p>
<p> The bulk of the storms in this area will be pushing further east by late Wednesday night and early Thursday morning. The Southeast, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast could all see storms on Thursday; however, the severe risk isn‚Äôt as high as it is for Wednesday. </p>
<p> Places like Atlanta, Washington, Philadelphia and New York City could all see storms, which could cause travel delays. </p>

<p> How To Predict Weather With Clouds (8 types of clouds and what they mean) </p>
<p> Before the invention of modern forecasting, humans knew how to predict weather by looking at clouds. </p>
<p> So on my quest to learn ancient survival & awareness skills, I decided to investigate what clouds can tell us about the weather. </p>
<p> To predict weather with clouds, you simply have to look at observable patterns like cloud size, cloud shape, altitude, vertical depth, and color shading within the cloud itself. </p>
<p> In general, when you see small, isolated clouds surrounded by a blue sky that lacks significant dark areas or signs of active growth, these are all indicators of fair weather ahead: </p>
<p> Then as clouds begin to expand in size and develop dark spots or occupy multiple layers of the sky, these are indicators of stormy weather developing: </p>
<p> While the basic rules for predicting weather with clouds are fairly simple, many people find this skill confusing because there are so many different types of clouds that all have their own nuances. </p>
<p> In actual practice, weather patterns take many days to evolve so you have to stay alert to what‚Äôs happening with the clouds over an ongoing period of time. </p>
<p> There are several different ways the transition from clear weather to storms can occur, so it‚Äôs important to know all the stages and how to identify the clouds you encounter as the weather changes. </p>
<p> So let‚Äôs go deeper and take some solid steps towards learning how to predict weather with clouds! </p>
<p> How To Read Clouds </p>
<p> The easiest method for learning how to read clouds is to have lots of real-life examples of what clouds look like in different weather patterns. </p>
<p> So for starters, I‚Äôve created this cloud video tutorial to show you some of the most important things you‚Äôll need to observe: </p>
<p> As you can see, reading the clouds is simply a matter of observing basic visual characteristics like the overall size, shape, and relative height of a cloud. </p>
<p> You can practice identifying these patterns in clouds by stepping outside to observe the sky while asking some sorting questions like: </p>
<p> How big are the clouds? </p>
<p> Are you seeing low, medium, or high altitude clouds? </p>
<p> Are there any dark spots or signs of active growth? </p>
<p> How many clouds are up there? </p>
<p> How much of the sky is covered? </p>
<p> How fast are the clouds moving? </p>
<p> As you practice observing the sky with these questions in mind, very quickly you‚Äôll notice there are obvious differences between the size, quantity, color & altitude of clouds. </p>
<p> The next step is using these raw observations to classify and identify different types of clouds that help us predict the weather. </p>
<p> Learning to identify clouds was a huge step on my personal journey to understanding weather patterns, so let‚Äôs look at this next. </p>
<p> Eight Different Types of Clouds That Predict Weather </p>
<p> There are eight main types of clouds that everyone should know if you really want to get good at predicting the weather with observation. </p>
<p> Luckily, learning to identify these eight cloud types is surprisingly simple once you know what to look for. </p>
<p> I was able to learn the basics of cloud identification with just a few hours of practice by studying things like altitude, size, and overall appearance, which we‚Äôll cover in this section. </p>
<p> ‚ÄãWhen I first got into weather tracking, I was amazed to discover just how obvious the difference is between low, medium, and high altitude clouds. </p>
<p> In this way, we can further simplify these eight cloud types by lumping them into four categories based on the altitudes where they appear in the sky. </p>
<p> Even though I‚Äôve included the numbers in feet, it‚Äôs not necessary to know the precise altitude of a cloud because the difference between low, medium & high altitude clouds is so obvious you can see it with the naked eye. </p>
<p> Each cloud type gives us useful information about what‚Äôs happening in the atmosphere and helps us predict the upcoming weather. </p>
<p> Some clouds are indicators that predict rain and storms approaching, while others are useful indicators of fair weather ahead. </p>
<p> You‚Äôll also notice that each layer includes a cumulus form and a stratus form. </p>
<p> An important principle here: If you can learn to recognize cumuliform and stratiform clouds at all three layers of the sky, you‚Äôll have everything you need to start predicting weather with clouds. </p>
<p> So let‚Äôs take a closer look at how to identify these different clouds: </p>
<p> 1. Cumulus Clouds </p>
<p> Cumulus clouds look like little puffballs gently floating through the sky at relatively low altitudes. </p>
<p> In fact, you‚Äôre probably already familiar with cumulus clouds whether you realize it or not. </p>
<p> If you‚Äôve ever spent a summer afternoon spotting sheep, elephants & unicorns in the sky, you were probably looking at cumulus clouds. </p>
<p> In layman‚Äôs terms, we might call these ‚Äúclumping clouds‚Äù (because they clump together). </p>
<p> The most important thing to observe is how big the cumulus cloud is, and whether there are signs of active growth. </p>
<p> It‚Äôs very easy to predict when cumulus clouds are a sign of evolving storms by looking at whether the cloud is expanding or dissipating. </p>
<p> Cumulus clouds are often associated with fair weather, especially when they stay small or wispy throughout the entire day. </p>
<p> When cumulus clouds grow big enough to expand into higher altitudes, they eventually become cumulonimbus clouds, which are storm clouds that we‚Äôll talk about in the section on clouds that produce rain. </p>
<p> For now, just remember to look for signs of active growth or dissipation in cumulus clouds as shown in the image above. </p>
<p> 2. Stratus Clouds </p>
<p> Stratus clouds can be difficult to identify because they often appear as a uniform layer of fog that covers the entire skyscape. </p>
<p> These clouds develop at a very low altitude and block out all the sunlight/blue sky, making it very hard to tell what‚Äôs happening at higher levels. </p>
<p> The obscured view caused by stratus clouds makes it particularly important to watch the sky over an ongoing period of time and look for general weather trends. </p>
<p> In some cases, Stratus clouds can be associated with storms, but it‚Äôs also equally possible to find clear blue skies just above the cloud layer. </p>
<p> This is especially common if you live close to the ocean where stratus clouds are often associated with fair weather as the fog burns off through the day. </p>
<p> For this reason, it‚Äôs important to pay careful attention to what other types of cloud activity were happening before the stratus clouds appeared. </p>
<p> If the onset of stratus clouds is preceded by several hours or days of higher altitude clouds gradually moving in and becoming thicker, this is very likely a sign of stormy weather ahead. </p>
<p> In the section on Nimbostratus clouds, we‚Äôll talk about how to predict storms that might be associated with stratus clouds. </p>
<p> But there are still a few other types of clouds we need to know first, so let‚Äôs move on to medium altitude clouds! </p>
<p> 3. Altocumulus Clouds </p>
<p> Altocumulus clouds are just like cumulus clouds except they happen at a higher altitude of the sky. </p>
<p> This higher altitude makes the clumps appear smaller and farther away giving the sky a mottled blue appearance. </p>
<p> These clouds are often associated with weather systems that grow into cumulonimbus storms (which we‚Äôll talk about in the section on clouds that produce rain). </p>
<p> Essentially this means altocumulus clouds indicate the possibility of stormy weather in the area, but that it‚Äôs likely not very close yet. </p>
<p> These clouds can be an early precursor to rain or snow and may occur many hours before any actual storm hits. </p>
<p> In order to determine what altocumulus clouds mean, you need to consider what the weather has been doing over the last week and whether the trend is getting more or less extreme. </p>
<p> If you see altocumulus clouds, keep watching for signs of increasing instability and active growth, especially in other cumulus clouds that could grow to become cumulonimbus. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you recently had a big storm, then altocumulus clouds could simply be the remnants of what‚Äôs already passed by. </p>
<p> The context is important! </p>
<p> 4. Altostratus clouds </p>
<p> Altostratus clouds, similar to altocumulus clouds are extremely important for predicting storms. </p>
<p> Notice the layers of cloud streaking out from the horizon. These streaks are caused by wind currents moving in the direction of the spreading pattern. </p>
<p> Altostratus clouds are extremely common to see before the approach of a storm, and they‚Äôre responsible for creating beautiful red skies at dawn & dusk. </p>
<p> If you‚Äôve ever heard the saying ‚Äúred sky at night sailer‚Äôs delight, red sky at morn watch out for a storm.‚Äù This is a reference to altostratus and altocumulus clouds. </p>
<p> When you see altostratus clouds, watch for a gradual thickening of these cloud layers that slowly gets lower and eventually blocks out all the sun before a storm (more on this when we talk about predicting rain). </p>
<p> 5. Cirrostratus Clouds </p>
<p> Cirrus clouds form at very high altitudes, and just like all layers of the sky, they include a cumulus form and a stratus form. </p>
<p> In the photo above we can see examples of both cirrostratus and cirrocumulus, as well as several jet condensation trails. </p>
<p> Cirrostratus clouds have a hazy spread-out look that can appear in patches as shown above or sometimes cover the entire sky. </p>
<p> If you‚Äôve ever noticed a halo around the sun or moon it‚Äôs probably because you were looking through the soft haze of a large cirrostratus cloud. </p>
<p> These clouds happen at such a high altitude that condensation occurs in the form of ice crystals, giving these clouds a strange sort of wispy appearance. </p>
<p> 6. Cirrocumulus Clouds </p>
<p> Cirrocumulus clouds are high altitude clouds that form in tiny mottled clumps. They look very much like altocumulus clouds, except they‚Äôre noticeably higher in the sky. </p>
<p> Cirrus clouds are often the earliest indicator that stormy weather is coming your way. </p>
<p> If you want to know whether cirrus clouds are a sign of storms ahead, look for signs of increasing instability on the middle and lower cloud levels over the next 24-48 hours. </p>
<p> If Cirrus clouds gradually become thicker and more pervasive, followed by gradually increasing altocumulus or altostratus clouds, you‚Äôre probably observing the approach of a weather system. </p>
<p> More on this in the next section on how to predict rain. </p>
<p> Clouds That Produce Rain </p>
<p> The two main types of clouds that produce rain are known as Nimbostratus clouds & Cumulonimbus clouds. </p>
<p> It‚Äôs important to point out a defining feature of storms is their associated clouds occupy multiple layers of the sky simultaneously, from 1500 ft all the way to 60,000 ft). </p>
<p> For this reason, one of the easiest ways to predict storms is to look for increasing cloud activity that spans to cover low, medium, and high altitude clouds all at the same time. </p>
<p> This is surprisingly simple once you get the hang of it. </p>
<p> 6. Nimbostratus Clouds </p>
<p> Nimbostratus clouds are simply stratus clouds that have become so big and dense, they drop rain or snow. </p>
<p> Notice in the above photo, you can‚Äôt even tell where the cloud begins and ends. It‚Äôs very dark, grey, relatively featureless compared to other types of clouds and covers a large area of the sky. </p>
<p> As a result, nimbostratus clouds can be difficult to identify on their own. </p>
<p> However, by the time a nimbostratus cloud arrives there typically have already been many signs of a storm developing for many hours or even days. </p>
<p> Nimbostratus is commonly associated with altostratus clouds, so that‚Äôs often the easiest way to predict the approach of these storms. </p>
<p> ‚ÄãNimbostratus clouds produce large amounts of rain and also snow during cold weather. </p>
<p> ‚ÄãIn a slow-moving weather system, these clouds can stay overhead and rain in a looming way for days at a time. </p>
<p> This is very different from the other main type of cloud that produces rain. </p>
<p> 7. Cumulonimbus Clouds </p>
<p> Cumulonimbus clouds are essentially just very big cumulus clouds that have grown so large that violent rain comes out the bottom. </p>
<p> This type of rain is often produced by warm, humid air rising on thermals in the summertime. This is sometimes called summer rain. </p>
<p> When cumulonimbus storms get big enough, they can produce intense lightning, hail, and even tornadoes. </p>
<p> These clouds drop a large amount of precipitation in a very short period of time, but the overall rain event typically lasts for much less time than nimbostratus rain. </p>
<p> In this case, it‚Äôs not uncommon for the morning to start out sunny, followed by pouring rain for an hour in the afternoon, and sunny again at 3PM. </p>
<p> Cumulonimbus clouds also have the greatest vertical depth of any cloud and frequently extend all the way through the lower, middle & even upper levels of the sky in a single cloud. </p>
<p> How To Predict Rain With The Clouds </p>
<p> As stated above, if you want to predict the approach of rain, it‚Äôs not enough to simply identify rain clouds in the sky. </p>
<p> We really need to be able to predict the approach of nimbostratus and cumulonimbus clouds BEFORE these clouds arrive. </p>
<p> Depending on the size, type, and intensity of a storm, early signs can be seen anywhere from a few hours to an entire week before rain arrives. </p>
<p> A single cloud usually doesn‚Äôt say all that much‚Ä¶ but combined with a SEQUENCE of changes in the architecture of the sky you can get a real sense for shifting patterns. </p>
<p> Rain Scenario #1 ‚Äì Nimbostratus Storms </p>
<p> Nimbostratus storms happen at the warm front of a depression or whenever warm air pushes into and over cold air. </p>
<p> These are often quite large weather systems that take several days to evolve, with the sky going through a gradual series of changes. </p>
<p> Here‚Äôs how to recognize a warm front and approach of nimbostratus clouds: </p>
<p> You start in a period of fair weather. </p>
<p> This is followed by high cirrus clouds gradually moving in and increasing in thickness and variety. </p>
<p> Next, altostratus clouds start moving in. These will emerge from the same general direction of the sky as the cirrus clouds. </p>
<p> Finally, the bottom layer of stratus clouds moves in becoming darker and denser as they completely obscure the sun. </p>
<p> This darkness continues to intensify until the rain starts. ‚ÄãAt this point the nimbostratus clouds are overhead. </p>
<p> It‚Äôs really that simple! </p>
<p> The entire process sometimes takes days to occur, which means you have lots of warning and time to anticipate the coming rain. </p>
<p> ‚ÄãAn interesting thing to note is weather systems that take a long time to develop will probably be much larger, last longer, and bring more precipitation. </p>
<p> ‚ÄãOther times there are small, fast-moving systems that can develop and move through in less than a day or two. </p>
<p> Rain Scenario #2 ‚Äì Cumulonimbus Storms </p>
<p> Cumulonimbus clouds happen at the cold front of a depression, or whenever cold air moves in upward drafts that mix with warmer air above. </p>
<p> This is a very different type of rain that develops much more quickly over a period of hours rather than days. </p>
<p> In this case, the series of changes you see in the clouds will start from the bottom of the sky and move towards the top. </p>
<p> The morning starts out relatively clear & calm. It might just seem like another beautiful sunny day. </p>
<p> As early morning evolves, you notice small puffs of low-level cumulus clouds floating across the sky. </p>
<p> As the day heats up, these small puffs start to expand upwards. You start to see increasing signs of active growth caused by thermals. </p>
<p> Eventually, these clouds become so congested that they begin to expand outwards and upwards at a massive rate. </p>
<p> When the clouds get large enough, they become cumulonimbus clouds and drop large amounts of rain, with possible hail, thunder & tornadoes in extreme cases. </p>
<p> These storms tend to only last a few hours at most, but can be extremely intense so it‚Äôs a good survival skill to recognize the advanced warning signs. </p>
<p> Cumulunimbus clouds form over a few hours, but you can usually detect the early signs of developing rain quite early in the day. </p>
<p> This type of storm tends to be a bit easier for beginners to predict because the changes happen much more rapidly and cumulus clouds are so easy to see. </p>
<p> 5 Tips For Learning To Predict Weather With Clouds </p>
<p> Of course, there‚Äôs a lot more we could say about predicting weather with clouds, but I hope this article has inspired you to get outside and start watching the sky with a more critical eye. </p>
<p> Here are some practical steps you can take now to begin applying the insights of clouds and hone your newfound weather prediction skills: </p>
<p> Learn to identify the difference between cumulus and stratus clouds at low, medium, and high levels of altitude. </p>
<p> Practice watching sequences of cloud changes associated with Nimbostratus storms vs Cumulonimbus storms. </p>
<p> Keep a cloud and weather journal and track sequences of clouds while testing your accuracy at all times of the year. </p>
<p> Practice using all your senses to make better observations. Adopt a favorite sit spot in nature and notice what else changes with the birds, plants & overall activity of nature as weather happens. </p>
<p> At the end of the day, weather prediction is a sensory skill that anyone can develop through simple practice & observation. </p>
<p> The best results will always come from combining what you observe about clouds with other clues from nature about upcoming weather changes like: </p>
<p> Rising humidity will cause your sense of smell to work better with approaching rain. </p>
<p> Humidity is also easier to sense through the air in your nose than through your skin. Don‚Äôt just sniff for scents‚Ä¶ pay attention to how the air feels in your nostrils. </p>
<p> Birds change their behavior and become more active before and after storms. You might notice sudden influxes of rare and vagrant birds being pushed out ahead of a storm system. </p>
<p> Flowers like dandelions respond to drops in pressure by closing their petals ahead of a storm. </p>
<p> Morning dew is a common sign of fair weather. If the grass is dry early morning, watch out for rain! </p>
<p> Each ecosystem has it‚Äôs own unique patterns. What is normal for your bioregion? Does weather usually develop quickly or slowly in your area?‚Äã </p>
<p> This is a huge topic, so let me know what questions you still have about clouds & weather prediction. Most importantly, have fun out there! </p>

<p> Expect rain. Those two simple words can ruin picnic plans or herald rescue for drought-stricken crops. Few things in our lives are as universal as the weather. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on in the atmosphere all around us all the time,‚Äù says Russ Schumacher, Colorado State climatologist and director of the Colorado Climate Center. ‚ÄúStorms and all the other interesting things that Earth‚Äôs atmosphere brings us have this big effect on our daily lives in a lot of ways.‚Äù But even though we tune in to local news stations or check apps to find out what the weather will bring, we don‚Äôt always trust the forecasts. You‚Äôve probably heard the joke: Meteorology is the only occupation where you can be wrong all the time and still get paid for it. </p>
<p> In reality, weather forecasts have improved in leaps and bounds in just the past few decades. And meteorologists in pursuit of an ever-more-perfect forecast continue to push what‚Äôs possible toward its theoretical limit. </p>
<p> Making the Weather </p>
<p> Before we can predict the weather, we have to understand where it comes from. To do that, we must look to the sky. </p>
<p> Earth is enveloped in an atmosphere of mostly nitrogen, oxygen and water vapor. This air, like liquid water, behaves as a fluid. As air flows from one place to another, it carries its properties with it, changing the temperature, humidity and more. Weather is simply the byproduct of our atmosphere moving heat from one place to another. </p>
<p> Cooler air is dense and can‚Äôt hold much moisture; warmer air is less dense and can hold more water. When regions of air with different temperatures and densities meet, the boundary is called a front. Sometimes these cloudy clashes can cause rain, as the cooling warm air is forced to drop its water. </p>
<p> It‚Äôs not just fronts that can make it rain; convection can also drive precipitation. As warm, moist air rises, it also cools, and its water condenses onto airborne particles such as dust. These droplets are carried aloft by rising air, growing larger and larger until they become too heavy and fall back to Earth. </p>
<p> When that happens, grab your umbrella. Once a storm has formed, if there‚Äôs nowhere for it to get more moisture from the ground or the air, it will peter out as it lumbers along. If it finds more warm air and moisture ‚Äî like a hurricane does as it moves across the ocean ‚Äî it will grow and grow. </p>
<p> Forecasting Basics </p>
<p> With so many factors involved, it may seem impossible to predict what weather is on the horizon. But that‚Äôs far from the case. ‚ÄúWeather forecasting is one of only a few fields where we can accurately forecast the evolution of a system. We cannot do that in economics or sports,‚Äù says Falko Judt, a research meteorologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. </p>
<p> Doing so depends on reliable observations. Scientific weather observations began in the Renaissance, when barometers and thermometers were invented. European scientists of old, like Galileo, used these instruments to take the types of measurements that would one day explain weather events. By the late 1800s, rudimentary weather maps had come into common use. </p>
<p> But early forecasts were limited and relied on persistence, or the assumption that a system‚Äôs past would dictate its future behavior. ‚ÄúIf a storm system is in Kansas one day and Missouri the next, then by persistence you can say it‚Äôll be in Illinois the next day,‚Äù explains Bob Henson, a meteorologist who writes for Weather Underground. Persistence is an OK way to predict the weather when conditions are constant ‚Äî when a storm trundles along without breaking up or the local climate changes little day to day, say, in Southern California. </p>
<p> But this simple technique doesn‚Äôt account for changing conditions, such as storms that form quickly through convection (typical for thunderstorms) or moving fronts that change the temperature. Luckily, we have newer, better ways to predict the future. Today‚Äôs weather forecasts aren‚Äôt made by people looking at weather maps and yesterday‚Äôs highs and lows ‚Äî they‚Äôre made by machines. </p>
<p> Modern Weather Prediction </p>
<p> Meteorologists use a process called numerical weather prediction to create forecasts by inputting current conditions ‚Äî which they call the ‚Äúnowcast‚Äù ‚Äî into computer models. The more current and accurate information available to these models, the better the forecast will be. Ground radar, weather balloons, aircraft, satellites, ocean buoys and more can provide three-dimensional observations that a model can use. This allows meteorologists to simulate what the atmosphere is currently doing and predict what will happen in the next few days or, for some models, hours. </p>
<p> Weather models divide a region, say a single state or even the whole globe, into a set of boxes, or cells. The size of these cells ‚Äî the resolution of the model ‚Äî affects its forecasting accuracy. Large boxes mean poor resolution, or the inability to tell what‚Äôs happening over small areas, but a broad picture of large-scale weather trends over long timelines. This big-picture forecast is helpful when you want to know how a big storm will move across the U.S. over the course of a week. </p>
<p> Smaller boxes mean higher resolution, which can forecast smaller storms. These models are more expensive in terms of computing power, and only run to the one- or two-day mark to tell people whether it might storm in their local area. Although all models are based on the same physics, each translates those physics into computer code differently, says Judt. Some models might prioritize certain kinds of data ‚Äî such as wind speed, temperature and humidity ‚Äî over others to generate predictions, or simulate physical processes slightly differently than another model. That‚Äôs why two models might spit out slightly different results, even with exactly the same starting observations. </p>

<p> The Human Touch </p>
<p> With computers now running the show, what‚Äôs left for human forecasters to do? </p>
<p> In terms of day-to-day weather like temperatures, perhaps not much. ‚ÄúFor a lot of the routine weather, the forecast models are so good now that there‚Äôs really not that much that the human forecasters are going to add,‚Äù says Schumacher, who is also an associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. </p>
<p> But don‚Äôt think humans are unnecessary just yet. ‚ÄúA forecaster might tweak what the computer tells you if they know their area really well and they know that models struggle with a certain kind of weather situation,‚Äù says Henson. </p>
<p> One such situation is precipitation, which is more challenging to forecast than temperature, says Matt Kelsch, a hydro meteorologist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder. ‚ÄúTemperature is a continuous field, meaning there‚Äôs a temperature everywhere,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúBut precipitation is a discontinuous field, meaning there‚Äôs a lot of places there is none, and then some places that it can be raining or snowing very hard.‚Äù And local geography ‚Äî mountain ranges, coastlines or the Great Lakes ‚Äî can affect precipitation in ways that models may not handle well. Particularly for forecasts within 24 to 36 hours, Kelsch says, a meteorologist‚Äôs experience with the forecasting area comes into play. </p>
<p> Forecasting high-impact situations such as hurricanes, tornadoes and floods is more challenging and comes with much higher stakes. ‚ÄúEspecially when it comes to extreme weather, human judgment is really important,‚Äù Henson says. </p>
<p> What Are the Chances? </p>
<p> The further in the future your picnic is scheduled, the harder it is to predict rain or shine. But since the 1950s, ever faster computers have been producing increasingly accurate weather forecasts. ‚ÄúMany of the world‚Äôs largest and most powerful supercomputers are devoted to atmospheric research ‚Äî to forecasting [weather] and to studying climate change,‚Äù Henson says. </p>
<p> According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, today‚Äôs five-day forecast is accurate about 90 percent of the time. The seven-day forecast is correct 80 percent of the time, and a 10-day forecast reflects the weather that actually occurs about 50 percent of the time. </p>
<p> What about major events? Based on National Hurricane Center forecasts since 2010, a hurricane‚Äôs eye made landfall, on average, just 47 miles from where a prediction 24 hours earlier said it would. That‚Äôs only about one-sixth of an average hurricane‚Äôs total size. ‚ÄúTwenty-four hours before a hurricane strikes land, we‚Äôve already pretty much nailed down where it will go,‚Äù says Judt. Going out to five days, the error in the forecasts since 2010 is about 220 miles. </p>
<p> These stats are more impressive when you consider how much meteorologists have improved the number of days out to which an accurate forecast can be made. For instance, today‚Äôs five-day hurricane forecast is more reliable than the four-day forecast in the early 2000s, and more reliable than a three-day forecast in the 1990s. And a 2015 Nature paper revealed that three- to 10-day forecasts have been improving by about a day per decade ‚Äî meaning a modern six-day forecast is as accurate as a five-day forecast 10 years ago. </p>
<p> Chaos Rules </p>
<p> As forecasts improve, one question naturally arises: How much better can they get? </p>
<p> Unfortunately, the chaotic nature of our atmosphere seriously limits our ability to model it ‚Äî and therefore to predict what it will do next. You‚Äôve probably heard that a butterfly flapping its wings in Hong Kong might cause the weather to change in New York. The idea of this ‚Äúbutterfly effect‚Äù ‚Äî in which minuscule changes can have huge impacts on the development of a dynamic system ‚Äî was coined in 1972 by mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz. </p>
<p> In practice, this means that a single weather model run more than once with even the most subtle differences in starting conditions can produce very different predictions. Since no measurement is perfect ‚Äî every observation has an associated uncertainty ‚Äî these small imperfections can cause big changes in what a model predicts. These changes get bigger and bigger the further ahead you try to predict. </p>
<p> Because of this, the potential predictability limit of weather is about two weeks, says Henson. ‚Äú[Lorenz] essentially said there‚Äôs just no way you can predict weather features beyond that time because those little butterfly wing flaps and countless other little things will add up to so many big changes, and there‚Äôs so much uncertainty beyond that range, that it‚Äôs just impossible to say anything,‚Äù he says. </p>
<p> Judt, whose work focuses on the theoretical limit of accuracy in weather forecasting, says we‚Äôll never be able to predict thunderstorms more than a couple of hours in advance, regardless of how good observations become. For hurricanes and winter storms, which are much bigger and therefore easier to spot in advance, the theoretical limit is two to three weeks ‚Äî ‚Äúso there‚Äôs still a couple of days to be gained, if not a whole week,‚Äù he says. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúWe could forecast perfectly if we had perfect knowledge of the atmosphere and if we had perfect weather models,‚Äù Judt says. But we will never be able to measure everything about every point in the atmosphere all the time with ultimate precision, and our models will never be flawless. ‚ÄúSo we will never be able to actually achieve perfect forecasts.‚Äù </p>
<p> Building a Better Forecast </p>
<p> There are more ways to improve forecasts than taking better observations and improving our weather models. Understanding how people use forecasts and warnings allows meteorologists to provide information in the most useful way. </p>
<p> One of the biggest challenges for meteorologists is condensing a forecast, which represents a spread of possible weather conditions to expect, into a single icon or a few sentences that appear in your weather app. </p>
<p> (Credit: Roen Kelly/Discover) </p>
<p> Take, for instance, today‚Äôs chance of rain in your area. This could mean slightly different things coming from different meteorologists, but in general, it‚Äôs not simply the odds that you, personally, will witness rain that day. Most forecasters calculate this number by multiplying their confidence that rain will occur by the area in which the rain might happen. So a 40 percent chance of rain might be a 100 percent chance in 40 percent of your county, or, a 60 percent chance across 70 percent of your county. </p>
<p> In addition, what this number doesn‚Äôt tell you is how much it will rain, how hard, when or for how long. So the next time you see a low chance of rain in your forecast, check the full weather report before you leave the umbrella at home. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúThe science has outrun our communications skills and knowledge, to a certain extent. So a lot of the challenge now is, how do we get people what they need?‚Äù says Henson. That‚Äôs because more information isn‚Äôt always the best way to communicate. ‚ÄúIf people don‚Äôt understand it, then it doesn‚Äôt help,‚Äù he says. </p>
<p> NOAA is working with social scientists to develop forecasts that are more relevant and better targeted. This is especially important because of how the internet has changed the way people obtain and share information, Kelsch says. </p>
<p> (Credit: Roen Kelly/Discover) </p>
<p> For instance, when creating the official forecast, meteorologists account for uncertainties by running a model several times. Each time, the model will give a slightly different result, but most results will be very similar. This ensemble of predictions is what becomes the official forecast. </p>
<p> But outlying, low-probability results occur in the ensemble, too. Since these data are accessible to the public, there‚Äôs always a risk the data will be shared out of context on social media. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a challenge that‚Äôs going away,‚Äù says Kelsch. </p>
<p> And though forecasts have improved dramatically, meteorologists are still blamed when they are wrong. ‚ÄúWe always need to remember that there never will be perfect forecasts, but we‚Äôre still improving them,‚Äù Judt says. </p>
<p> Because for all of us, ‚Äúthe most salient weather forecast is the one that was wrong ‚Äî when you expected something and you were surprised, those are the ones you remember. You don‚Äôt remember all the times that it was just as we expected because that‚Äôs not news,‚Äù Henson says. </p>
<p> For meteorologists, then, the end goal is to make almost every day‚Äôs forecast an utterly forgettable one. </p>
<p> Where the Magic (Forecast) Happens </p>
<p> In many countries, a single public weather service is typically the only source available for forecasts, warnings and alerts. These meteorologists work for public (government) organizations or universities. By contrast, the United States has strong public, private (commercial) and university-based weather observation and forecasting programs. </p>

<p> ‚ÄúWe also are a large country and a populous country, and one with a great deal of weather variation. I think all those things have strengthened our interest in weather and our support for weather research and forecasting,‚Äù says Weather Underground‚Äôs Bob Henson. In other words, the U.S. is a bit of a weather powerhouse. Here, most forecasts originate at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). </p>
<p> These centers are part of the National Weather Service (NWS), which itself is a part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The NCEP runs weather models, then disseminates the results ‚Äî as well as forecasts ‚Äî to NWS offices, which may customize the forecasts for their region. </p>
<p> For long-term, large area predictions, the most popular U.S. model is the Global Forecast System, or GFS. On June 12, NOAA announced its first major upgrade for GFS in nearly 40 years. The upgrade incorporates a new dynamical core, which is the model‚Äôs description of how the atmosphere behaves. The new system, called GFS-FV3, is better at modeling moisture and clouds, allowing meteorologists to forecast storms with greater accuracy than ever before. </p>
<p> Commercial weather providers typically have some weather modeling capabilities of their own. For example, Weather Underground refines the official forecast to a neighborhood scale by adding information from its network of over a quarter-million personal weather stations. This gives you accurate weather information for your exact location when you open the service‚Äôs app, rather than what the weather is doing across town. </p>
<p> Each company fills a different niche, providing different forecasts that focus on, say, surfing conditions, fire conditions or transportation concerns, based on specific observations and models that refine the broad public-sector data. These differences are also why you might prefer using one app or service over another. </p>

<p> Before you start this tutorial, complete the Raspberry Pi online simulator tutorial or one of the device tutorials. For example, you can go to Raspberry Pi with Node.js or to one of the Send telemetry quickstarts. In these articles, you set up your Azure IoT device and IoT hub, and you deploy a sample application to run on your device. The application sends collected sensor data to your IoT hub. </p>
<p> Machine learning is a technique of data science that helps computers learn from existing data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends. ML Studio (classic) is a cloud predictive analytics service that makes it possible to quickly create and deploy predictive models as analytics solutions. In this article, you learn how to use ML Studio (classic) to do weather forecasting (chance of rain) using the temperature and humidity data from your Azure IoT hub. The chance of rain is the output of a prepared weather prediction model. The model is built upon historic data to forecast chance of rain based on temperature and humidity. </p>
<p> Important </p>
<p> Support for Machine Learning Studio (classic) will end on 31 August 2024. We recommend you transition to Azure Machine Learning by that date. </p>
<p> Beginning 1 December 2021, you will not be able to create new Machine Learning Studio (classic) resources (workspace and web service plan). Through 31 August 2024, you can continue to use the existing Machine Learning Studio (classic) experiments and web services. </p>
<p> ML Studio (classic) documentation is being retired and may not be updated in the future. </p>
<p> An Azure Storage account, A General-purpose v2 account is preferred, but any Azure Storage account that supports Azure Blob storage will also work. </p>
<p> Note </p>
<p> This article uses Azure Stream Analytics and several other paid services. Extra charges are incurred in Azure Stream Analytics when data must be transferred across Azure regions. For this reason, it would be good to ensure that your Resource Group, IoT Hub, and Azure Storage account -- as well as the Machine Learning Studio (classic) workspace and Azure Stream Analytics Job added later in this tutorial -- are all located in the same Azure region. You can check regional support for ML Studio (classic) and other Azure services on the Azure product availability by region page. </p>
<p> Deploy the weather prediction model as a web service </p>
<p> In this section you get the weather prediction model from the Azure AI Library. Then you add an R-script module to the model to clean the temperature and humidity data. Lastly, you deploy the model as a predictive web service. </p>
<p> Get the weather prediction model </p>
<p> In this section you get the weather prediction model from the Azure AI Gallery and open it in ML Studio (classic). </p>
<p> Select Open in Studio (classic) to open the model in Microsoft ML Studio (classic). Select a region near your IoT hub and the correct workspace in the Copy experiment from Gallery pop-up. </p>
<p> Add an R-script module to clean temperature and humidity data </p>
<p> For the model to behave correctly, the temperature and humidity data must be convertible to numeric data. In this section, you add an R-script module to the weather prediction model that removes any rows that have data values for temperature or humidity that cannot be converted to numeric values. </p>
<p> On the left-side of the ML Studio (classic) window, select the arrow to expand the tools panel. Enter "Execute" into the search box. Select the Execute R Script module. </p>
<p> Drag the Execute R Script module near the Clean Missing Data module and the existing Execute R Script module on the diagram. Delete the connection between the Clean Missing Data and the Execute R Script modules and then connect the inputs and outputs of the new module as shown. </p>
<p> Select the new Execute R Script module to open its properties window. Copy and paste the following code into the R Script box. </p>
<p> When you're finished, the properties window should look similar to the following: </p>
<p> Deploy predictive web service </p>
<p> In this section, you validate the model, set up a predictive web service based on the model, and then deploy the web service. </p>
<p> Select Run to validate the steps in the model. This step might take a few minutes to complete. </p>
<p> Select SET UP WEB SERVICE > Predictive Web Service. The predictive experiment diagram opens. </p>
<p> In the predictive experiment diagram, delete the connection between the Web service input module and the Select Columns in Dataset at the top. Then drag the Web service input module somewhere near the Score Model module and connect it as shown: </p>
<p> Select RUN to validate the steps in the model. </p>
<p> Select DEPLOY WEB SERVICE to deploy the model as a web service. </p>
<p> On the dashboard of the model, download the Excel 2010 or earlier workbook for REQUEST/RESPONSE. </p>

<p> About this project </p>
<p> Especially in 2020, instant heavy and violent rainfalls have caused detrimental effects on greenhouses and crop yields in my country. Unfortunately, these days unexpected and excessive rainfalls occur more frequently and became relatively common due to climate change in some areas. Meanwhile, other regions suffer from drought. As 2020 passes, more than thirty-five incidents that caused the loss of crops and livestock due to heavy and violent rainfalls are recorded in my region. To contribute to the solution to forfend and avert excessive rainfall instigated problems like agricultural productivity loss, I contemplated this project as a starting point. </p>
<p> Primarily, I focused on excessive rainfall effects on agriculture in this project. However, excessive rainfalls can lead to numerous hazards, for example [1]: </p>
<p> flooding, including risk to human life, </p>
<p> damage to buildings and infrastructure, </p>
<p> loss of crops and livestock, </p>
<p> landslides, which can threaten human life, disrupt transport and communications. </p>
<p> As shown in the latest studies, excessive rainfall can affect crop productivity in various ways, including direct physical damage, delayed planting and harvesting, restricted root growth, oxygen deficiency, and nutrient loss. Thus, too much rain can be as dangerous as drought for agriculture: "Data from the past three decades suggest that excessive rainfall can affect crop yield as much as excessive heat and drought. In a new study, an interdisciplinary team from the University of Illinois linked crop insurance, climate, soil, and corn yield data from 1981 through 2016. The study found that, during some years, excessive rainfall reduced U.S. corn yield by as much as 34% relative to the expected yield. Data suggest that drought and excessive heat caused a yield loss of up to 37% during some years [2]". </p>
<p> Unfortunately, early warning systems are not enough to entirely prevent exacerbating effects of excessive rainfall on agricultural products and processes without adequate and preliminary local weather data for each greenhouse or farm. Therefore, in the hope of averting the detrimental effects of excessive rainfall on agriculture, I decided to create this project as a budget-friendly remote weather station to collect and interpret local weather information to make more accurate predictions on the rainfall intensity. </p>
<p> After doing some research about deep learning and neural networks, I decided to build an artificial neural network (ANN) based on the classification model to interpret the accumulated local weather data to predict the rainfall intensity according to the given classes. As the following study indicates, researchers have applied different neural network models and types to forecast not only rainfalls but also weather phenomena: "Many experiments have used neural networks to predict quantitative rainfall amounts at various locations and look-ahead ranges. For instance, researchers in Thailand were able to obtain highly accurate forecasts using feed-forward neural networks to predict quantitative rainfall amounts in the one to three-hour look-ahead range in order to predict possible flooding dangers. Neural networks have also been used to predict weather phenomena besides the traditional forecast values, such as probability/amount of rainfall, wind speed, barometric pressure, etc. They have been used very successfully to predict tornadoes. Additionally, researchers in Australia successfully used a neural network to identify fog at various forecast ranges ranging from 3 hours to 18 hours around Canberra International Airport [3]." </p>
<p> Before building and testing my neural network model, I had collected weather data at my balcony and backyard in three kilometers radius for more than three months to create a local weather data set showing weather information in my neighborhood. To be able to elicit weather information even in extreme weather conditions, I used a Weather Station Kit with Anemometer, Wind Vane, and Rain Bucket by DFRobot with two different development boards: </p>
<p> Thus, I could transfer weather data via WiFi at my balcony or GPRS if the distance between my router and the weather station is too far away. </p>
<p> I decided to use Google Sheets, a cloud-based spreadsheet program, to collate weather data generated by the weather station because creating big data sets and appending new information are simple with the Google Sheets API. Hence, I developed a web application in PHP to obtain weather data transferred by the development boards and append it to a spreadsheet on Google Sheets. </p>
<p> After completing collecting weather data for more than three months every five minutes, I built an artificial neural network (ANN) model with TensorFlow to make predictions on the rainfall intensity. Theoretically, I assigned a rainfall intensity class for each reading after scaling and normalizing the data set. Then, I trained the neural network model to classify these classes: </p>
<p> Moderate Rainfall </p>
<p> Heavy Rainfall </p>
<p> In the following steps, you can find more detailed information on coding, local weather data collection, and building an artificial neural network (ANN) model with TensorFlow. </p>

<p> ‚≠ê Weather Station Kit with Anemometer/Wind Vane/Rain Bucket | Inspect </p>
<p> ‚≠ê SIM808 GPS/GPRS/GSM Shield For Arduino | Inspect </p>
<p> Step 1: Assembling the weather station kit with an anemometer, wind vane, and rain bucket </p>
<p> This weather station kit includes an anemometer, wind vine, rain bucket, and a sensor board to send weather data via the serial communication protocol. Thus, it is easy-to-use with development boards to collect local weather data. </p>
<p> It outputs 37 bytes per second, including the end CR/LF. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê First of all, attach the anemometer and the wind vane to the bridge by using screws and nuts. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Connect the wind vane to the anemometer by using the RJ11 phone cord and tighten it under the bridge. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Then, mount the stainless steel stick to the bridge with screws. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Install the rain bucket joint under the rain bucket with screws. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Lastly, place the rain bucket on the stainless steel stick by using screws and nuts. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Now, it is ready to collect weather data even in extreme weather conditions. However, the sensor (converter) board is not weather-proof, so I added a plastic box to the weather station to protect the sensor board and the SIM808 shield outdoors. </p>
<p> Step 2: Collecting weather data on Google Sheets </p>
<p> To be able to send information to a spreadsheet on Google Sheets, you need to create a new application in the Google Developer Console and get verification credentials to utilize the Google Sheets API. If you are a novice in creating applications with the Google Developer Console, follow the instructions below. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Go to Google Developer Console and click the 'NEW PROJECT' button. Enter the project name as Remote Weather Station. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Go to the APIs & Services and click to the API library to enable the Google Sheets API. </p>
<p> Step 2.1: Getting credentials to use the Google Sheets API </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Open the project dashboard and click the Credentials button. Then, fill the form as depicted below to create the service account and key. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Click the CREATE CREDENTIALS button and configure the consent screen to be able to create an OAuth client ID. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Then, create a new OAuth client ID named Client under Desktop app (application type). </p>
<p> ‚≠ê After creating the OAuth client ID (Client) download the credentials (ID and Secret) and name the file as credentials.json. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê If needed, modify a chart to inspect the collected data, as did I. </p>
<p> Step 3: Developing a web application in PHP to append weather data to the spreadsheet </p>
<p> This PHP web application is for getting weather data transferred by the development boards (ESP8266 and SIM808) via an HTTP Get request and appending that data to a given spreadsheet (by ID) on Google Sheets with verified credentials and token. </p>
<p> The web application requires the Google Client Library for PHP to append weather data to a given spreadsheet on Google Sheets. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê So, first of all, create a folder named remote_weather_station in your server and install the Google Client Library for PHP in it. </p>
<p> The remote_weather_station folder should include these four files in addition to the Google Client Library to work: </p>
<p> index.php </p>
<p> account_verification_token.php </p>
<p> credentials.json (Step 2.1) </p>
<p> token.json (Step 3.1) </p>
<p> In this step, I will discuss the first two files - index.php and account_verification_token.php: </p>
<p> üíª index.php </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Get local weather data from the weather station via a Get request: </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Connect to the Google Developer Console application named Remote Weather Station by using the credentials.json file (Step 2.1). </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Load previously authorized token from a file (token.json), if it exists. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê If there is no previous token or expired, request authorization from the user and set the verification code to create the token.json file with the file_put_contents() function. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Enter the spreadsheet ID and range to append recent findings from the weather station to the spreadsheet. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê After authorizing the web application by the created AuthUrl, enter the given verification code to set an access token. </p>
<p> Step 3.1: Setting up the web application on Raspberry Pi (or any server) </p>
<p> After creating the PHP web application, I decided to run it on my Raspberry Pi, but you can run the application on any server as long as it is a PHP server. </p>
<p> If you want to use Raspberry Pi but do not know how to set up a LAMP web server on Raspberry Pi, you can inspect this tutorial. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê First of all, move the application folder (remote_weather_station) to the apache server (/var/www/html) by using the terminal since the apache server is a protected location. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê The web application throws an error when opened for the first time due to the missing verification code. To obtain the verification code, go to the generated authorization link by the application. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Then, click to Go to Remote Weather Station (unsafe). </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Grant the application with the required permissions. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Now, copy the verification code and paste it into account_verification_token.php. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Return to the web application. It should display the confirmation message: Successful! Refresh the page. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê After refreshing the page, the web application uses the verification code to get an access token and saves the access token in a file named token.json. Thus, it does not throw an error again. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê To test whether the PHP web application is appending new data to the given spreadsheet accurately: </p>
<p> Step 4: Reading and sending weather data with ESP8266 (WiFi) </p>
<p> To collect weather data at my balcony, I used a NodeMCU ESP-12E (ESP8266) development board with the weather station. </p>
<p> I programmed it to send weather data to the PHP web application every five minutes. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Include required libraries and define the WiFi settings. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Define weather station settings and the serial connection pins - D6, D5. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê In the getBuffer() function, get data from the weather station. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Debug the weather data and create the link. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Send data packets every 5 minutes to Raspberry Pi (or any server). </p>
<p> ‚≠ê After uploading the code to the NodeMCU ESP-12E (ESP8266) development board, it displays weather data every second on the serial monitor and sends data packets every five minutes (300 seconds) to the PHP web application. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Then, it shows the response from the server. </p>
<p> Step 4.1: Reading and sending weather data with SIM808 (GPRS) </p>
<p> To collect weather data in my backyard, I used a SIM808 shield for Arduino Uno if the distance between the weather station and my router is too far away. </p>
<p> Most of the code is the same and covered in the previous step aside from the parts below. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Include required libraries and define the sim808 object. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Initialize the SIM808 module and continue if it is working accurately. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Send data packets every 5 minutes to the server by establishing a TCP connection to make a GET request. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê After creating the line string, convert it from string to char array to make an HTTP Get Request with the SIM808. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê After uploading the code to the SIM808 shield, it displays weather data every second on the serial monitor and sends data packets every five minutes (300 seconds) to the PHP web application. </p>
<p> Step 4.2: Creating the weather data set for more than three months </p>
<p> After finishing coding, I started to collate weather data on Google Sheets every five minutes for more than three months to build a neural network model and make predictions on the rainfall intensity. </p>
<p> Then, I downloaded the spreadsheet as Remote Weather Station.csv, consisting of 32219 rows as my preliminary local weather data set. I am still collating weather data to improve my data set and model :) </p>
<p> Step 5: Building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with TensorFlow </p>
<p> When I completed collating my preliminary local weather data set, I started to work on my artificial neural network (ANN) model to make predictions on the rainfall intensity. </p>
<p> I decided to create my neural network model with TensorFlow in Python. So, first of all, I followed the steps below to grasp a better understanding of the weather data: </p>
<p> Data Visualization </p>
<p> Data Scaling (Normalizing) </p>
<p> Data Preprocessing </p>
<p> Data Splitting </p>
<p> After applying these steps, I decided to use my neural network model to classify different rainfall intensity classes theoretically assigned as labels (outputs) for each input (row). I created my classes according to the rate of precipitation, which depends on the considered time. </p>
<p> The following categories are used to classify rainfall intensity by the rate of precipitation (rainfall): </p>
<p> Light rain ‚Äî when the precipitation rate is < 2.5 mm per hour </p>
<p> Moderate rain ‚Äî when the precipitation rate is between 2.5 mm and 7.6 mm per hour </p>
<p> Heavy rain ‚Äî when the precipitation rate is between 7.6 mm and 50 mm per hour </p>
<p> Violent rain ‚Äî when the precipitation rate is > 50 mm per hour </p>
<p> According to the precipitation (rainfall) rates, I preprocessed the weather data to assign one of these five classes for each input as its label: </p>
<p> 1 (Light Rain) </p>
<p> 2 (Moderate Rain) </p>
<p> 3 (Heavy Rain) </p>
<p> After scaling (normalizing) and preprocessing the weather data, I elicited seven input variables and one label for each reading, classified with the five mentioned classes. Then, I built an artificial neural network model with TensorFlow to obtain the best possible results and predictions with my preliminary data set. </p>
<p> 32 [Hidden] </p>
<p> To execute all steps above, I created a class named Weather_Station in Python after including the required libraries: </p>
<p> Subsequently, I will discuss coding in Python for each step I mentioned above. </p>
<p> Also, you can download IoT_weather_station_neural_network.py to inspect coding. </p>
<p> Step 5.1: Visualizing and scaling (normalizing) the weather data </p>
<p> Before diving in to build a model, it is important to understand the weather data to pass the model appropriately formatted data. </p>
<p> So, in this step, I will show you how to visualize weather data and scale (normalize) in Python. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê First of all, read the weather data from Remote Weather Station.csv. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê In the graphics() function, visualize the requested columns from the weather data set by using the Matplotlib library. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê In the data_visualization() function, inspect all columns before scaling weather data to build a model with appropriately formatted data. </p>
<p> After visualizing weather data, I scaled (normalized) each column to format it properly. </p>
<p> Normally, each row (reading) looked like this before scaling: </p>
<p> 315, 0.45, 0, 0.51, 0.51, 22.78, 65, 1005.5 </p>
<p> ‚≠ê In the scale_data() function: </p>
<p> ‚≠ê The wind direction in units of degrees and angles do not make good model inputs. 360¬∞ and 0¬∞ should be close to each other and wrap around smoothly. The direction should not matter if the wind is not blowing. Thus, convert the wind direction and velocity columns to a wind vector to interpret them easily with a neural network model. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê For the remaining columns except for 1h_RF, divide them into average reading values to scale (normalize) and format. </p>
<p> After completing scaling (normalizing), I extracted these new columns from the weather data set: </p>
<p> Step 5.2: Training the model (ANN) on the rainfall intensity classes </p>
<p> Before building and training a neural network model in TensorFlow, I needed to create the input array and the label array by preprocessing the scaled and normalized weather data set. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê In the create_input_and_label() function: </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Firstly, append each input element as a NumPy array to the input array and convert it to a NumPy array by using the asarray() function. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Each input element includes seven variables [shape=(7, )]: </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Then, evaluate the approximate rainfall (precipitation) rate for each reading (row). </p>
<p> approx_RF_rate = (1h_RF + scaled_24h_RF) * 100 </p>
<p> ‚≠ê According to the rainfall rate, assign a class [0 - 4] for each input element and append them to the label array. </p>
<p> After preprocessing the scaled weather data to create input and label arrays, I split them as training (60%) and test (40%) data sets: </p>
<p> Then, I built my artificial neural network (ANN) model by using Keras and trained it with the training data set for nineteen epochs. </p>
<p> You can inspect these tutorials to learn about activation functions, loss functions, epochs, etc. </p>
<p> After training with the preliminary training data set, the accuracy of the model is between 0.83 and 0.85. </p>
<p> Step 5.3: Evaluating the model and making predictions on the rainfall intensity </p>
<p> After building and training my artificial neural network model, I tested its accuracy by using the preliminary testing data set. </p>
<p> For now, the evaluated accuracy of the model is between 0.72 and 0.73 due to inadequate testing data set overfitting the model. However, I am still collecting weather data to improve the model accuracy. </p>
<p> Then, I used my neural network model to make predictions on the rainfall intensity with a given prediction array consisting of readings from the weather station after the training of the model. As a starting point, the model works fine :) </p>
<p> The model predicts possibilities of labels for each input element as an array of 5 numbers. They represent the model's "confidence" that the given input element corresponds to each of the five different classes of rainfall intensity [0 - 4]. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê In the make_prediction() function, make a prediction for each input element in a given array and get the most accurate label [0 - 4] by using the argmax() function to display its class name. </p>
<p> I connected the sensor (converter) board to the NodeMCU ESP-12E (ESP8266) development board and fastened them to a plastic box while collecting weather data at my balcony. </p>
<p> Connections and Adjustments (SIM808) </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Note: D0, D1, D12 pins are occupied by the SIM808 GPS/GPRS/GSM Shield. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Connect an external battery (7-23V) for the SIM808 module to work properly. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Attach the GPS antenna and the GSM antenna to the SIM808 shield. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Insert a SIM card into the SIM slot on the SIM808 shield. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Before uploading the code, set the function switch on the shield to None (1). </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Upload the code. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Then, set the function switch to Arduino (3). </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Press the Boot button on the shield until seeing the Net indicator LED flashing every 1 second and wait for the SIM card to register the network - the Net indicator LED will slowly flash every 3 seconds. </p>
<p> ‚≠ê Click here to get more information about the SIM808 GSM/GPS/GPRS Shield. </p>
<p> After setting up the SIM808 shield with Arduino Uno, I connected the sensor (converter) board to it. </p>
<p> I placed all components into a plastic box to collect weather data outside, even in extreme weather conditions, since the sensor board is not weather-proof. </p>
<p> Then, I fastened the plastic box to the weather station. </p>
<p> Videos and Conclusion </p>
<p> After completing coding and assembling the weather station, I collated local weather data for more than three months every five minutes to build my neural network model successfully. </p>
<p> I am still collecting weather data at my balcony and backyard to improve my neural network model and its accuracy :) </p>

<p> There are more weather words in Japanese but these are the four most common that you hear all the time on the radio and TV. If you travel on the bullet train you'll also see them on the front monitors. = ha re = sunny or fine. It's made up of the Japanese symbols for "day" and "blue" = ku mo ri = cloudy. On its own "ku mo" means "cloud". It's also sounds the same as "ku mo" for spider (different symbols though!) = yu ki = snowy or snow. = a me = rainy or rain. One other word I added to the song is = to ki do ki = sometimes. Apart from sounding good, you hear it all the time in weather reports when they say "hare tokidoki ame" to mean "sunny but sometimes rainy". </p>

<p> There will be more sunshine and blue skies over Leicestershire today, Friday March 25, as the gorgeous weather we've been enjoying rolls into its second week. Conditions will be warmer than Spain, no less, for the third successive day, according to forecasters. </p>
<p> Temperatures reached 18C (64.4F) yesterday with Hinckley once again proving to be the hottest spot in the county for the second day running. It's a case of "more of the same" today, however, sunseekers are advised to make the most of it because it is not going to last. </p>
<p> Weatherman Phil Morrish, who has been monitoring conditions from his Mountsorrel weather station, said we've now had seven days of sunshine. "It was yet another warm and sunny day yesterday (Thursday) with 10 hours of sunshine recorded again - and temperatures up to 18C once again," he said. </p>
<p> "Hinckley was the place to for the second day with a maximum temperature of 18C recorded. Here in Mountsorrell we got a high of 17C (62.6F) - and it was the same at East Midlands Airport. If anything it was just a bit down on Wednesday but very similar. And Friday is going to a case of more of the same." </p>
<p> "It's going to be a similar day to yesterday (THURS) with a high pressure system sitting almost over us," added Phil. "So another warm and sunny day is in the offing. </p>
<p> "It might be a little chilly in the morning, with a low of 3C (37.4F) after clear skies overnight - but it's soon going to hot up and reach as high as 18C again." </p>
<p> That's going to be hotter than the 12C (53.6F) forecast for the Spanish capital Madrid - and on a par with Lisbon, Portugal. Phil said we've now had seven days of continuous sunshine and warm conditions. </p>
<p> But he warned that we need to make the most of the balmy spring weather while we can. That's because the high pressure system that's been over the UK will soon be moving northwards towards Iceland. </p>
<p> "It means, rather than warm winds coming up from North Africa, it's going to reverse and we're going to be drawing in cold air from the Arctic next week instead," he said. "So, I'd say we've got two more warm and sunny days to go, including today, before things start to change." </p>
<p> "The weekend will gradually become more cloudy and will not be quite as warm, with temperatures dropping to the mid-teens," added Phil. "But by Tuesday or Wednesday we will see them down to single digits again - around 8 or 9C (48.2F). And we could even get some wintry showers." </p>
<p> The Met Office is forecasting "fine and dry" conditions for Leicestershire today. On its website, the national weather service said the day will start with early mist and fog patches. However, this will soon clear to leave "another fine and dry day with plenty of sunshine". It also forecasts a maximum temperature of 18C. </p>
<p> Outlook for Saturday to Monday: </p>
<p> Staying fine and settled, with warm sunny spells. Chilly nights, with patchy frost and fog. Turning cooler from Sunday for coastal areas, with an increasing risk of low cloud. </p>

<p> March 2022 Weather Forecast: Spring Weather on the Way </p>
<p> Subhead </p>
<p> The Almanac‚Äôs Weather Forecast for March </p>
<p> Michael Steinberg </p>
<p> February 9, 2022 </p>
<p> Let‚Äôs talk weather predictions for March 2022. According to weather folklore, if March ‚Äúcomes in like a lion, [it] goes out like a lamb.‚Äù Let‚Äôs see what sort of weather March has in store for us this year. </p>
<p> ADVERTISEMENT </p>
<p> March 2022 Weather Forecast </p>
<p> ‚ÄúSpring forward,‚Äù indeed! Looking at the month of March as a whole, we see that spring will get off to an early start, with above-average temperatures across much of the central and eastern United States and nearly all of Canada outside of the Northwest Territories. The western United States will experience below-average temperatures and near- to below-average precipitation. </p>
<p> It will also be on the drier side from the southern Plains eastward to the Southeast and from southern British Columbia to the Canadian Prairies. Most other areas will experience above-average precipitation. </p>
<p> Notable Dates in March </p>
<p> The month of March will start off with Mardi Gras on March 1, which looks to be a celebratory sunny and mild day in New Orleans. Just off to the west, Texas Independence Day on March 2 will be warm with a few showers. </p>
<p> March 8, International Women‚Äôs Day, will be sunny and warm from the Gulf Coast to the Southeast. Rain and mild weather are expected from the Northeast through the Midwest, with rain and snow showers from the High Plains to the Rockies. The West Coast will see some rain at times, while rain and snow showers will be found across much of Canada. </p>
<p> We‚Äôll ‚Äúspring forward‚Äù and mark the start of Daylight Saving Time by setting the clocks ahead 1 hour on March 13, but many areas will not get to enjoy that extra hour of daylight in the evening. Rain and snow showers will move across the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, Northeast, and mid-Atlantic states, and temps will be on the colder side of average. Sunshine will be common across the western United States, but temps will be on the cool side here, too. Even across southern Canada, there will be snow showers around, with a little rain mixed in along the western shore. </p>
<p> Folks heading to St. Patrick‚Äôs Day celebrations on March 17 will want to bundle up across the East and in the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley regions. Most areas will be sunny and dry, but there will be a few rain and snow showers from the Northeast back through the Great Lakes. The weather will have the luck of the Irish across much of the Plains, with sunshine and a warm day foreseen. There could be a few thunderstorms across Oklahoma and Texas. Unsettled weather with rain and mountain snow will impact much of the western United States. Snow showers will continue to be moving across much of southern Canada, with some rain mixed in near the B.C. coast. </p>
<p> The spotty precipitation events may also dampen any viewing parties dedicated to celebrating the full Worm Moon on March 18. </p>
<p> Springlike weather will appropriately occur in most areas at the spring equinox on March 20, with rain showers in the forecast in the northern third of the U.S. and southern third of Canada, and even a possibility of snow showers along the Rocky Mountains. </p>
<p> On Seward‚Äôs Day in Alaska on March 28, flurries will be flying across northern areas, with rain and snow across southern parts of the state </p>
<p> ‚ÄúIn Like a Lion, Out Like a Lamb‚Äù </p>
<p> Now back to this proverb. If you think about it, the proverb makes sense for March. It‚Äôs a transitional month starting with winter, ending with spring. </p>
<p> Where did this proverb come from? </p>
<p> It‚Äôs appeared over the centuries. John Ray (1627‚Äì1705) was a naturalist who wrote, ‚ÄúMarch hack ham [hackande = annoying] comes in like a lion, goes out like a lamb.‚Äù This is published in the ‚ÄúCatalogue of English Proverbs‚Äù in 1670. The phrase ‚ÄúMarch came in like a lion‚Äù shows up in Ames Almanac in 1740. </p>
<p> A favorited theory (which fits the Almanac) is that the proverb is based on astronomy and the positions of the constellations. At the beginning of the year, we have Leo the Lion (eastern horizon); by the end of March, it‚Äôs Aries the Ram (western horizon). </p>
<p> There have also been religious associations: Jesus arrives as the sacrificial lamb at Easter, but will return as the Lion of Judah. Weather-wise, this means a false spring. </p>
<p> Of course, the Almanac has many other March proverbs in its archives. Here are a couple that have lasted the ages: </p>
<p> So many mists in March you see, So many frosts in May will be. </p>
<p> March comes in with adders‚Äô heads and goes out with peacocks‚Äô tails. </p>
<p> They aren‚Äôt quite as memorable as the lion and the lamb! </p>

<p> Good or bad weather....it‚Äôs just GOT to be better than last March when all was locked down, panic prevailed and fear gripped the nations. Let‚Äôs pray for a healed world in 2021 and spring‚Äôs abundance of regrowth! </p>
<p> Cnut was a wild Viking that came onto the shores of Great Britain leading frightening and destructive raids, i.e. "He came in like a Lion". In his later years he adopted Christianity and became a kind and just leader, i.e. "He went out like a Lamb". That's my story and I'm stickin' to it --->Smile. </p>
<p> As always, we enjoy reading the predictions. Absolutely loved the tribute to Theodor Geisel (Dr. Seuss) and your possible explanation for the March Lion to Lamb proverb in respect to the constellations. </p>
<p> It wasnt has bad has awinter here has it was last year untell feb 27th lol got a snow storm had two days of digging out than anther heavy snow fall for today march 1st then we have anther system of snow this weds but you was right again this winter thank you </p>

<p> Markov Chains and Weather Prediction </p>
<p> A Markov Chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of events, where the probability of each event depends only on the present state depends only on the present state, and not on the past history of the process. </p>
<p> More precisely a random process (sometimes also called a stochastic process) is a Markov Chain if for , and all states, </p>
<p> . </p>
<p> This just requires that the probability of being in state at time only depends on the previous state, and NOT the states at times . In a sense this means the that the system does not remember the previous states. </p>
<p> One application of Markov Chains is in weather prediction. This is an extremely simple but useful model for predicting the weather (note that there are other weather prediction models). Suppose you are going skiing and want to know about snowfall conditions tomorrow (we could also do a similar example, looking at whether the weather would be ‚Äúsunny‚Äù or ‚Äúrainy‚Äù tomorrow). Here there are two possible states: a ‚ÄúSnow Day‚Äù where there are at least 50mm (approximately 2 inches) of snow on a given day and a ‚ÄúGreen Day‚Äù where there is less than 50 mm of snow. We denote the event that day t is a ‚ÄúSnow Day‚Äù by and the event that day t is a ‚ÄúGreen Day‚Äù by . </p>
<p> Let . This is the probability that tomorrow is a ‚ÄúGreen Day‚Äù given that today was a Green Day. Similarly, we let </p>
<p> We represent this Markov Chain with the following diagram. </p>
<p> Note that we are assuming that the snowfall on the next day (day t+1) only depends on the present day (day t) and not the previous day. These probabilities are known as the transition probabilities. </p>
<p> Observe that We define a matrix: </p>
<p> known as the transition matrix. </p>
<p> Estimates for the transition matrices for New York, NY and Del Norte, CO are given below. These were obtained by analyzing historical weather patterns between December 17th and December 31st (for more details on how these were obtained, refer to the ‚ÄúTo Ski or Not to Ski‚Äù article). </p>
<p> Let‚Äôs look at an example. Suppose that in New York, on day 0 (December 17th) we have a snow day. This is represented by the vector . The vector is known as a state vector.Let‚Äôs predict the weather for the first three days (December 18-20). The weather on day 1 (December 18th) can be predicted as follows: </p>
<p> From here we see that the probability that tomorrow is a Snow Day is 22.4%, while the probability that day 1 is a ‚ÄúGreen Day‚Äù is 77.6%, which is exactly what we would expect. Continuing, we can predict the weather on Day 2: </p>
<p> So there is about a 61% chance day 2 (December 19) is a Snow Day and about a 39% chance that it is a ‚ÄúGreen Day.‚Äù </p>
<p> Finally, the weather on day 3 is given by: </p>
<p> This gives a 48.8% chance of there being a ‚ÄúSnow Day‚Äù on day 3 and a 51.2% chance of their being a ‚ÄúGreen Day‚Äù on day 3. </p>
<p> Observe further that we have: </p>
<p> So, on day k our weather prediction will be </p>
<p> . </p>
<p> Similarly, we can forecast the first three days in Del Norte, CO. Let‚Äôs again assume that day 0 (December 17) is a ‚ÄúSnow Day.‚Äù We have: </p>

<p> The Met Office have said temperatures will be 'close to zero' in the week ahead as they issue a weather prediction. </p>
<p> The Exeter-based forecaster have said temperatures will generally remain above freezing across the South West but will drop with long periods of clear spells. </p>
<p> A weather prediction starting from today January 22 to Wednesday, January 26 says the region will see a minimum temperature of 1 ¬∞C. </p>
<p> Another dry though often rather cloudy day. Some bright or sunny spells are likely, especially across the east of the region. In the brighter spells and light winds it may feel a tad less cold than of late. Maximum temperature 9 ¬∞C. </p>
<p> Tonight: </p>
<p> Remaining rather cloudy but dry tonight. Temperatures generally remaining above freezing though may drop close to zero in any longer clear spells. Minimum temperature 1 ¬∞C. </p>
<p> Sunday: </p>
<p> The cloudy but dry weather is set to continue on Sunday. A chance of some bright spells for north Devon and Cornwall. Maximum temperature 8 ¬∞C. </p>
<p> Outlook for Monday to Wednesday: </p>
<p> Often cloudy with perhaps some drizzle in the far west. Some sunshine is likely at times with patchy frost and fog overnight where skies clear. </p>
<p> Devon County Council Highways and Emergency Planning has advised motorists to take 'extra care' when travelling as not every road will be covered. </p>
<p> Advice from the RAC says motorists driving in icy conditions should keep an eye out for patches of ice, keep low speeds, be aware that breaking distances will be longer and try to make acceleration, braking and steering smooth to avoid skid risk. </p>
<p> Salting, or "gritting", is typically done when weather forecasts predict a coming freeze. </p>
<p> Gritters are scheduled to salt the county's precautionary salting routes, a network of roads that cover more than 900 miles and drivers are recommended to "drive with care" during the freezing conditions. </p>

<p> Much cooler weather, rain and snow to move into NE Colorado for the weekend </p>
<p> Precipitation expected to start as rain Friday night, change to snow for weekend </p>

<p> UPDATE (Friday, 2:20 p.m.): The National Weather Service in Boulder has issued winter weather advisories for the northern and central mountains, Larimer, Weld, Morgan, Logan, Sedgwick and Phillips counties. We have a newly updated story with what to expect through the weekend. Click here for the latest. </p>
<p> ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî </p>
<p> DENVER ‚Äì While high temperatures in Denver could reach the 70s Thursday, they won‚Äôt stick around long, as rain is expected to move into the area Friday night and change over to snow this weekend as temperatures continue to fall. </p>
<p> Temperatures are expected to reach the mid-60s in Denver on Friday before temperatures begin to drop Friday evening and precipitation moves into northeastern Colorado. </p>
<p> The initial moisture will likely start as rain, and some thunderstorms could develop with heavy rain and small hail overnight, according to the National Weather Service in Boulder. But it will change over to a wintry mix and then to snow over the plains as we move into early Saturday morning. </p>
<p> A series of storm systems will bring colder temps & snow beginning Friday night & continuing through the weekend. Precipitation begins as rain Friday & early Saturday for lower elevations. Roads are expected to become slick at times, especially in the mountains. #cowx pic.twitter.com/fRJlcOuWDs </p>
<p> On Saturday morning, another cold front will move across northeastern Colorado and increase the chance for a brief period of snow showers. However, precipitation is expected to decrease Saturday afternoon, though the chance is higher for the mountains at that time, according to the NWS. </p>
<p> A trough will move over the area Saturday night into Sunday morning, lowering temperatures further and bringing another round of widespread and steady snow compared to the first front. The snow showers are likely to stick around on and off through Monday as of Thursday‚Äôs forecast release. </p>
<p> But exactly where the heaviest snow falls during the multi-day storms remains somewhat in question, according to the NWS. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúThere remains a considerable amount of uncertainty with regards to snowfall totals for this period of active weather,‚Äù NWS forecasters wrote on Thursday. </p>
<p> The NWS said the northern mountains will likely see the most snow in the storm and that an advisory for those areas would likely be issued first. And there could be heavy banded snow on the far northeastern plains Friday night, according to the NWS. </p>
<p> After Friday, it is likely advisories, watches or warnings will be issued for most of northeastern Colorado for Sunday into Monday, the NWS said. </p>
<p> After a quick boost from last week‚Äôs storms, the statewide snowpack leveled off during the dry period over the past week or so. It sat at 92% of median as of Thursday. </p>
<p> The Gunnison basin was the only of the eight rivers basins above median levels Thursday, at 105% of median, but the others are not too far behind. </p>
<p> The Upper Colorado Headwaters (98%), South Platte (97%), Laramie and North Platte (95%), San Miguel, Dolores, Animas and San Juan (97%), and Upper Rio Grande (90%) basins were all slightly below median levels as of Thursday. </p>
<p> The Yampa and White (85%) and Arkansas (84%) basins were slightly further below median levels. </p>
<p> Nearly 92% of the state is seeing moderate or worse drought, and 57% of the state is experiencing severe drought or worse. Eight percent of the state ‚Äì along the southern border and in northwestern Moffat County ‚Äì is experiencing extreme drought conditions. </p>
<p> Denver7 will continue to provide updates as we track this storm into and through the weekend. You can always watch 24/7 weather, radar and news updates on the free Denver7+ app on your TV. </p>

<p> Bizarre 'rain' falls amid crystal clear skies near Seattle </p>
<p> Video shows a drenching rain falling in the backyard of a home north of Seattle despite sunshine and clear skies overhead. </p>
<p> The sun was shining near Seattle last week, but in one backyard, it was pouring rain? We solve the mystery: </p>
<p> MILL CREEK, Wash. -- There's probably a joke in here somewhere that even when the skies are sunny, those in the Seattle area can still experience rain. </p>
<p> But that's what happened in a rather peculiar sight in a backyard north of the city Wednesday where it was raining in the backyard, despite nary a cloud in sight. </p>
<p> "I noticed the pavement was dry, but it was wet under the trees," said Patrick Andre. "Usually, the pavement is wet in the rain, and it is dry under the trees." </p>
<p> What's happening? </p>
<p> The night before had featured frost and dense fog -- temperatures dropped to just below freezing, leaving the trees covered in frost. </p>
<p> Wednesday afternoon, the fog layer finally burned off, and the blazing sunshine, along with a burst of warmth into the upper 30s, began to rapidly melt all the frost, making it rain on a sunny day -- at least in one backyard. </p>

<p> Naive Bayes: A Baseline Model for Machine Learning Classification Performance </p>
<p> We can use Pandas to conduct Bayes Theorem and Scikitlearn to implement the Naive Bayes Algorithm. We take a step by step approach to understand Bayes and implementing the different options in Scikitlearn. </p>
<p> Bayes Theorem </p>
<p> The above equation represents Bayes Theorem in which it describes the probability of an event occurring P(A) based on our prior knowledge of events that may be related to that event P(B). </p>
<p> Lets explore the parts of Bayes Theorem: </p>
<p> P(A|B) - Posterior Probability </p>
<p> The conditional probability that event A occurs given that event B has occurred. </p>
<p> P(B) - Evidence </p>
<p> The probability of event B. </p>
<p> The conditional probability of B occurring given event A has occurred. </p>
<p> Now, lets explore the parts of Bayes Theorem through the eyes of someone conducting machine learning: </p>
<p> P(A|B) - Posterior Probability </p>
<p> The conditional probability of the response variable (target variable) given the training data inputs. </p>
<p> P(A) - Prior Probability </p>
<p> The probability of the response variable (target variable). </p>
<p> P(B) - Evidence </p>
<p> The probability of the training data. </p>
<p> frequency of (outlook=rainy) when (play=yes) / frequency of (play=yes) = 3/9 </p>
<p> P(play=yes) </p>
<p> frequency of (play=yes) / total(play) = 9/14 </p>
<p> P(outlook=rainy) </p>
<p> frequency of (outlook=rainy) / total(outlook) = 5/14 </p>
<p> The probability of playing tennis when it is rainy is 60%. The process is very simple once you obtain the frequencies for each category. </p>
<p> Here is a simple function to help any newbies remember the parts of Bayes equation: </p>
<p> Here is a simple function to calculate the posterior probability for you, but you must be able to find each part of bayes equation yourself. </p>
<p> Lets see another way to find the posterior probability this time using contingency tables in Python: </p>
<p> These tables are all pandas dataframe objects. Therefore using pandas subsetting and the function I made, we can arrive at the same conclusion: </p>
<p> Naive Bayes Algorithm </p>
<p> Naive Bayes is a supervised Machine Learning algorithm inspired by the Bayes theorem. It works on the principles of conditional probability. Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm for binary and multi-class classification. The Naive Bayes algorithm uses the probabilities of each attribute belonging to each class to make a prediction. </p>
<p> Example What is the probability of playing tennis when it is sunny, hot, highly humid and windy? So using the tennis dataset, we need to use the Naive Bayes method to predict the probability of someone playing tennis given the mentioned weather conditions. </p>
<p> Now by using the above contingency tables, we will go through how the Naive Bayes algorithm calculates the posterior probability. </p>
<p> Calculate P(x|play=yes). In this case x refers to all the predictors 'outlook', 'temp', 'humidity' and 'windy'. </p>
<p> P(sunny|play=yes)‚Üí2/9 </p>
<p> P(hot|play=yes)‚Üí2/9 </p>
<p> P(high|play=yes)‚Üí3/9 </p>
<p> P(True|play=yes)‚Üí3/9 </p>
<p> Calculate P(x|play=no) using the same method as above. </p>
<p> Calculate the probability of playing and not playing tennis given the predictors </p>
<p> The prediction will be whichever probability is higher </p>
<p> Type of Naive Bayes Algorithm </p>
<p> Python's Scikitlearn gives the user access to the following 3 Naive Bayes models. </p>
<p> Gaussian </p>
<p> The gaussian NB Alogorithm assumes all contnuous features (predictors) and all follow a Gaussian (Normal Distribution). </p>
<p> Multinomial </p>
<p> Multinomial NB is suited for discrete data that have frequencies and counts. Spam Filtering and Text/Document Classification are two very well-known use cases. </p>
<p> Bernoulli </p>
<p> Bernoulli is similar to Multinomial except it is for boolean/binary features. Like the multinomial method it can be used for spam filtering and document classification in which binary terms (i.e. word occurrence in a document represented with True or False). </p>
<p> Lets implement a Multinomial and Gaussian Model with Scikitlearn </p>

<p> Air temperatures at 4 p.m. on Sunday were 10 to 20 degrees cooler than the same time on Saturday, thanks to the thick clouds. (credit: CBS) </p>
<p> Don‚Äôt let your guard down with regard to the NCAR Fire on Monday as conditions could be much like they were when the fire started on Saturday. Gusty wind from the southwest is expected to develop on Monday afternoon. Speeds could be as high as 20 to 30 mph at times with afternoon highs well into the 70s around Boulder. </p>
<p> In addition to the warm and dry weather there will be low relative humidity values during the afternoon and evening hours on Monday around Boulder. At this point the National Weather Service has not placed the area under a Red Flag Warning but there are warnings that will go into effect late Monday morning for the southeast Denver metro area and a large part of south-central and southeast Colorado. </p>
<p> By Monday night and Tuesday morning the clouds will return to the Boulder area and they will be relatively thick as moisture moves into the state ahead of an approaching storm. Rain showers are expected to develop by the afternoon on Tuesday in Boulder. </p>
<p> Temperatures will fall sharply behind a cold front and that will allow relative humidity values to rise. If the rain can last long enough it may mix with or change to snow for a brief time Tuesday night in the Boulder area. Any accumulation would be light and probably confined to grassy surfaces. </p>

<p> After two cloudy days mixed with scattered showers, New Brunswickers can enjoy a return to sun and warm temperatures on Thursday. </p>
<p> It will be a mostly sunny on Thursday with temperatures climbing to 20 C in some parts of New Brunswick, according to CBC meteorologist Peter Coade. </p>
<p> Coade says the fair weather isn't expected to last, however, with two disturbances moving in Friday and bringing rain. </p>
<p> "These two disturbances will combine over the region in a blissful marriage before moving off to the south Labrador Sea for their honeymoon. The bottom line is if you don't get wet from one of them you will from the other," he said. </p>
<p> On Saturday, the Maritimes will clear slowly and Sunday brings the possibility of more showers developing late in the day. </p>
<p> "Temperatures will be quite variable over the next few days," Coade said. </p>
<p> Thursday forecast </p>
<p> In northern New Brunswick, Thursday will be mostly sunny with afternoon cloudiness and winds from the west gusting to 40 kilometres per hour and a high of 18 C. </p>
<p> For the Fredericton area, Thursday will be mainly sunny with winds from the west gusting to 40 km/h before noon and a high near 20 C. </p>
<p> In southern New Brunswick, Thursday will be sunny and windy with some afternoon cloudiness and a high of 20 C. </p>
<p> Winds will be from the west to southwest, gusting to 50 km/h in the afternoon, gusting to 70 km/h in the Tantramar marsh area. </p>

<p> The Pacific Northwest coast saw two atmospheric rivers (ARs) bring heavy rains from Nov. 10-16, 2021, resulting in severe flooding, landslides, and damage to infrastructure in the British Columbia province of Canada. ARs are long, narrow corridors of water vapor that travel vast distances above the ocean from warm, tropical regions to higher latitudes, where they often release their moisture as rainfall when they reach land areas. While ARs occur across the globe, this year has been notable for several strong events that have impacted the Pacific Northwest coast. The two atmospheric rivers in </p>
<p> The Pacific Northwest experienced a memorable series of storms in late Oct. 2021 as several low-pressure systems rolled in from the northeast Pacific Ocean. One of the systems was classified by meteorologists as a ‚Äúbomb cyclone‚Äù, meaning that its central pressure (an indication of storm strength) had dropped particularly rapidly in a short time period. At its minimum pressure (highest strength), the system was reported by the National Weather Service to have had the lowest pressure of a system over the northeastern Pacific Ocean since reliable observations began in 1974. The system was notable </p>
<p> From late Sept. through early Oct. 2021, two powerful storms churned over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans: Typhoon Mindulle, which peaked as a Category 5 storm, and Hurricane Sam, a Category 4 hurricane and one of the longest-lived hurricane-strength storms on record over the Atlantic Ocean. While neither storm posed a direct threat to land, Mindulle brushed by eastern Japan, leaving heavy rainfall accumulations in the area near Tokyo. Despite the fact that neither storm made landfall, the storms‚Äô slow-motion tracks across warm ocean waters allows an opportunity to observe how the strong winds </p>
<p> Although it only reached hurricane status for a brief period, Hurricane Nicholas made an impact on the northern Gulf Coast by bringing heavy rains to an area still recovering from the devastating effects of powerful Hurricane Ida, which made landfall in Louisiana just over 2 weeks earlier. Nicholas formed after a tropical wave passed over the Yucatan Peninsula and into the Bay of Campeche, providing a focus for shower and thunderstorm development.

<p> Monthly Outlook </p>
<p> Last updated 15:15 GMT on Friday 25 March </p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> Early April becomes very active </p>
<p> It will be pleasant and settled this weekend, more unsettled for a time next week, and becoming cooler with some pockets of snow over high ground and wintry showers popping up at times. </p>
<p> Further ahead into April we should see a more unsettled spell as Atlantic lows take charge of the weather across the country. Some very wet conditions are a possibility with lows nearby or over the country for much of the time. Over the latter half of the forecast, the signs point to a fairly typical April but perhaps on the windy side over the last week. </p>
<p> Saturday 26 March to ‚Äì Sunday 3 April </p>
<p> A cooler pattern from the middle of the week </p>
<p> High pressure over the United Kingdom is virtually stationary whilst declining a little into next week. This will allow more active weather systems to affect us from the middle of the week as pressure falls across continental Europe. However, high pressure should build again from Friday. </p>
<p> We expect calm and settled weather during Saturday and Sunday with a good chance of long sunny spells. However, early morning fog is possible. Temperatures should be around 3-4C above normal. </p>
<p> Monday should start dry. From late morning showers may pop up across Wales and northern England, but they should die out during the evening. On Tuesday the sky gets a little cloudier with a risk of isolated showers although many areas could stay dry. Some rain is possible across Scotland from the afternoon, with high ground pockets of snow possible as well. </p>
<p> Wednesday could see the rain move across northern England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the afternoon. Scotland could see wintry showers, especially in the north and east. Thursday should see the rain move further south across south-west England through the day. Some hill snow is possible. Any lingering wintry showers across the northern UK should begin to ease out through the afternoon. </p>
<p> Further isolated showers may affect the country on Friday and may be wintry over the northern UK. Conditions should dry through the afternoon with a good chance of sunshine, though it may be on the cool side. Temperatures over the working week start at 2-3C above normal but cool to 3C below average by Thursday. </p>
<p> Saturday could see further isolated showers, perhaps wintry in the north, but many areas could dodge them altogether. Sunday should see a more settled day with more sunshine. Temperatures next weekend should be around 1-2C below average, with Sunday the milder day. </p>
<p> Monday 4 April to ‚Äì Sunday 10 April </p>
<p> Wet with periods of high winds </p>
<p> Further ahead in April we should see a return to an unsettled pattern across the country as a series of Atlantic lows drive several frontal troughs across us. Timing of events is difficult during this week, but we can give an indication. </p>
<p> Monday could see a band of rain moving across Northern Ireland and the western half of the country. South-east England could start dry but the rain could reach these parts as well through the early evening. The rain could be accompanied by strengthening winds. </p>
<p> Tuesday looks to be a very wet day across the country with the chance of further strong winds. One of the models shows quite heavy rain lingering over England through much of the day with very strong winds across Northern Ireland and the south coast. Wednesday could see a respite as the rain clears east but showers could move in across Scotland. Should the winds turn to the north some snowfall across higher ground in Scotland cannot be ruled out. </p>
<p> Thursday could remain unsettled with further spells of wind and rain. On Friday the signs point to a continuation of the unsettled weather for all parts. Temperatures over the working week should be near seasonal but some cooler periods are possible should we get any brief spells of northerly winds. </p>
<p> Confidence is low for the weekend. One scenario is a brief settled spell on Saturday as a transitory ridge moves across ahead of a return to the unsettled pattern on Sunday. Temperatures over the weekend should remain near seasonal. </p>
<p> Monday 11 April to ‚Äì Sunday 24 April </p>
<p> No extremes of wind or rain </p>
<p> Further ahead into April, confidence is on the low side. The signs point to an active low-pressure track from the UK into Scandinavia and eastern Europe, bringing spells of rain and increased winds but possibly less active than the previous week, with a near seasonal temperature pattern across the country. </p>
<p> A near average rainfall pattern is anticipated across Northern Ireland and Scotland with some wet and dry days. It could be on the windy side. England and Wales could see the wetter weather with the weather systems possibly more focused here. </p>
<p> Over the last week of the forecast, the performance of all the models is unreliable. We favour low pressure across the north-east Atlantic with a high favoured across south-east Europe. This would bring near seasonal temperatures across much of the country, with wet and windy conditions at times, but no extremes and perhaps more seasonal precipitation across Northern Ireland and Scotland. </p>
<p> There are other outcomes possible over the later part of the forecast with the models struggling to perform at a longer range. One alternative scenario is for low pressure to be move across south-east Europe while the Azores high extends towards us. This would bring a more settled pattern, especially in the south. We estimate this possibility at 35%. </p>
<p> Further ahead </p>
<p> With a new set of data we hope to get a better idea for the Easter weekend. </p>

<p> What Does Percent Chance of Rain Mean? </p>
<p> Chance of rain is the chance anywhere in the forecast region will get rain. (Craig Whitehead/unsplash.com) </p>
<p> You‚Äôve seen it in weather reports: ‚ÄúToday there is a 60% chance of rain‚Äù. Does this mean you have a 6 out of 10 chance of getting wet if you are outside? Will only 60% of your area definitely get rain? Will it rain 60% of the day? Just what does percent chance of rain mean to a weather forecaster? </p>
<p> PoP and Chance of Rain </p>
<p> Weather forecasters use the term PoP, or Probability of Precipitation when describing the percent chance of rain. PoP is defined as the chance of measurable precipitation occurring at any point in a selected area. This definition means that at any given point in the forecast area, there is a PoP percent chance of measurable precipitation during the time period of the forecast. But where do weather forecasters arrive at this value? </p>
<p> The probability of precipitation is calculated from the product of two variables. The first variable is ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù. How confident is the forecaster precipitation will occur somewhere in their forecast area? This value ranges between 0 (no precipitation possible) to 1 (definitely going to rain) and comes down to the forecaster‚Äôs best guess from other data and models. </p>
<p> The second variable is ‚Äúarea affected‚Äù or A. This is the percent of the forecast area will receive the precipitation if there is any precipitation. This variable comes down to the forecaster‚Äôs best guess again based on models and other data. </p>
<p> PoP Examples </p>
<p> Since both variables have a certain slush factor, PoP can have different meanings depending on which variable the forecaster focuses on. </p>
<p> If the forecaster thinks it definitely will rain (C = 1) over 60% of their forecast area (A = 0.60), then </p>
<p> PoP = C x A PoP = 1 x 0.6 PoP = 0.6 or 60% chance of precipitation. </p>
<p> If the forecaster is only 75% sure it will rain (C = 0.75) and if it does, only 80% of the forecast area will see that rain (A = 0.80), then </p>
<p> PoP = C x A PoP = 0.75 x 0.80 PoP = 0.60 or 60% chance of precipitation. </p>
<p> Both of these examples give the same value for the chance of precipitation but have different meanings. The first example shows that 60% of the area definitely will see some measurable rain while 40% will not. The second example shows a smaller chance of rain that affects a larger area.Typically, weather forecasters will offer additional information where you can make your own decisions about possible rainfall. </p>
<p> Typically, weather forecasters will offer additional information where you can make your own decisions about possible rainfall. Some forecasters emphasize the chance you will see rain at some time during the forecast period. Others emphasize the area affected. If they say 60% chance of rain, 60% of their area will experience rain at some point during the forecast period. The forecaster will often mention which interpretation they adhere to. </p>
<p> Keep in mind, PoP only refers to the chance of precipitation, NOT how much rain you will get. A 100% chance of rain could mean buckets of rain all day or just a light sprinkle in the afternoon. All you can tell is you are likely to see some sort of precipitation. Likewise, 20% chance of rain means you‚Äôre unlikely to see any rain at all today, or 20% of the area is going to be drenched. </p>
<p> Alternate Terms for PoP Values </p>
<p> Some forecasters offer terms like ‚Äòisolated showers‚Äô, ‚Äòscattered showers‚Äô, or ‚Äòshowers likely‚Äô when they wish to avoid presenting a numeric value for PoP. Isolated generally means ‚Äòlow PoP‚Äô, scattered means roughly 50-50 and showers likely corresponds to high PoP values. </p>
<p> Your best interpretation is knowing your forecaster. They tend to use the same interpretation each time and will explain further if there are other discussion points to their predictions. </p>

<p> It is set to be another warm day in Plymouth today. The Met Office has predicted a "very warm" Sunday for the city as part of a South West weather forecast. </p>
<p> Temperatures as high as 15 degrees on Sunday are predicted with the sun set to shine all day. So it will be a perfect day to go out and enjoy the sunshine. </p>
<p> The Exeter-based forecaster has said we should expect a "fine and dry" Sunday with largely sunny skies. But the weather might turn as next week starts. </p>
<p> The Met Office forecast says: "A dry, largely sunny and pleasantly warm day on Sunday once any early fog soon clears. However, patches of low cloud may develop at times towards the northeast, and near to English Channel coasts. Maximum temperature 18 ¬∞C. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúTonight will be a dry evening and night with late sunshine followed by clear periods and a local grass frost. However, the odd patch of low cloud at first, becoming more extensive later. Minimum temperature 2 ¬∞C. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúMonday will be a dry morning with misty low cloud breaking to give bright spells. However, the cloud is likely to become more extensive again, perhaps with some showers in the west later. Maximum temperature 17 ¬∞C. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúBut cloud becoming more widespread through the week with an increased chance of showers or rain, perhaps even some snow in places. Windier by Thursday and feeling colder as temperatures drop.‚Äù </p>
<p> Met Office Chief Meteorologist Paul Gundersen said: ‚ÄúAlthough the UK has had a good deal of fine and settled March weather in recent days, a change is on the way from the middle of next week with colder air spreading down from the north and the increasing likelihood of rain for most areas. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúWith the influence of some unsettled weather, we‚Äôll be seeing a marked drop in temperatures for most with colder air arriving from the north. This will see maximum temperatures drop into single figures for many areas, and below freezing overnight.‚Äù </p>

<p> The Met Office says Plymouth is in store for sunny days and temperatures as high as 14C. </p>
<p> A forecast for the city says after a cloudy start today, the sun will appear from 4pm onwards. </p>
<p> Full suns are also forecast all day on Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, before clouding over again on Monday. </p>
<p> Temperatures in Plymouth will peak at 12 degrees Celsius today at approximately 12pm. </p>
<p> Despite the sun it isn't all good news, with wind speeds continuing to gather across the city with a maximum wind speed of 26mph in the afternoon. Heading into this evening, the outlook appears a dry one with clear skies but a cold and frosty morning is likely to develop tomorrow (March 17). </p>
<p> The Met Office has forecast the following for the south west region: </p>
<p> Today </p>
<p> "Showery periods of rain, especially in eastern parts of the region during the morning. Much of the region will be dry through the afternoon with some bright spells. Feeling mild in any brightness with light winds. Maximum temperature 12 degrees Celsius. </p>
<p> Tonight </p>
<p> "Skies clearing from the west this evening and remaining dry overnight with lengthy clear periods. Becoming cold and turning frosty for many with a few mist patches developing by dawn. Minimum temperature -2 degrees Celsius. </p>
<p> Thursday </p>
<p> "After a cold start, it will be a dry and mostly sunny day. Some patchy cloud developing during the afternoon. Feeling pleasantly warm in the afternoon sunshine. Maximum temperature 14 degrees Celsius. </p>
<p> Friday to Sunday </p>
<p> "Dry and mainly sunny throughout. Chilly nights and mornings but feeling pleasantly warm during the afternoons in the sunshine. Strong and gusty easterly winds at times, especially on exposed coasts." </p>
<p> UK long range weather forecast </p>
<p> "The period starts with mostly dry and sunny conditions once early morning fog clears. Areas of the far north and south may see more cloud with some isolated showers possible in the far southwest by Sunday evening. </p>
<p> "For the rest of the period most areas continue to remain mostly dry and settled, especially across the south of the UK, where overnight fog and frost is possible. Any showers or more prolonged spells of rain are most likely to affect the far north and northwest, where winds are likely to be stronger too. </p>
<p> "Winds in the south are expected to be generally light. Temperatures will most likely be close to, or slightly above, the long-term average." </p>

<p> Abstract </p>
<p> Probabilistic category learning is often assumed to be an incrementally learned cognitive skill, dependent on nondeclarative memory systems. One paradigm in particular, the weather prediction task, has been used in over half a dozen neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies to date. Because of the growing interest in using this task and others like it as behavioral tools for studying the cognitive neuroscience of cognitive skill learning, it becomes especially important to understand how subjects solve this kind of task and whether all subjects learn it in the same way. We present here new experimental and theoretical analyses of the weather prediction task that indicate that there are at least three different strategies that describe how subjects learn this task. (1) An optimal multi-cue strategy, in which they respond to each pattern on the basis of associations of all four cues with each outcome; (2) a one-cue strategy, in which they respond on the basis of presence or absence of a single cue, disregarding all other cues; or (3) a singleton strategy, in which they learn only about the four patterns that have only one cue present and all others absent. This variability in how subjects approach this task may have important implications for interpreting how different brain regions are involved in probabilistic category learning. </p>
<p> Probabilistic category learning has been studied extensively in both animals and humans since the 1950s, and has proven to be a fertile domain for the development and testing of formal models of learning and memory (Medin and Schaeffer 1978, Nosofsky 1984, Estes 1986; Gluck and Bower 1988a,b). In the last several years, this paradigm from cognitive psychology has become popular within cognitive neuroscience as a method for studying the neural substrates for learning incrementally acquired cognitive skills. However, it appears that these tasks may actually be solvable by a range of different strategies. This study presents techniques to deduce what strategies a subject is likely to be using on the basis of post-hoc analyses of behavioral responding. These techniques may be useful for determining whether various groups‚Äîsuch as different clinical populations‚Äîare using qualitatively different strategies as compared with control subjects. </p>
<p> Many studies of the cognitive neuroscience of probabilistic category learning have used a paradigm known as the weather prediction task, developed in our lab at Rutgers University in the early 1990s as a variation of an earlier probabilistic category learning design from Gluck and Bower (1988a). As described in Knowlton et al. (1994) (Experiment 1, Task 2), subjects in the weather prediction task are given multidimensional stimuli and asked to classify them into one of two categories. These stimuli are composed from a set of four tarot cards (Fig. ‚Äã(Fig.1),1), each of which contains a unique geometric pattern. </p>
<p> The four cards used as cues in Knowlton et al. (1994). Each card was associated with each possible outcome with a fixed probability. </p>
<p> The stimulus presented on each training trial consists of one or more of these cards presented in a random spatial order. Table ‚ÄãTable11 shows the 14 patterns that were used in the Knowlton et al. (1994) weather-prediction study. Each pattern is represented as a numeric four-digit sequence corresponding to whether each of the four cards is present (1) or absent (0). Thus, pattern A = 0001 has card 4 (squares) present, pattern B = 0010 has card 3 (diamonds) present, pattern C = 0011 has both card 3 and card 4 present, and so on. On each trial, subjects see one of these patterns, and are asked to predict whether there will be good or bad weather (sun or rain). The actual weather outcome is determined by a probabilistic rule based on the individual cards, whereby each card is a partially accurate predictor of the weather. </p>
<p> Table 1 </p>
<p> Stimulus Patterns Used in the Knowlton et al. (1994, Experiment 1) Weather Prediction Task </p>
<p> In the past several years, this weather-prediction task has been used in over half a dozen different studies. Amnesic patients have been reported to learn the weather-prediction task normally during the first 50 trials, although they are impaired relative to controls with further training (Knowlton et al. 1994, 1996a). Patients with basal ganglia dysfunction due to Parkinson's disease or Huntington's disease show impaired learning from the very start of training (Knowlton et al. 1996a,b). These results have been interpreted as supporting the claim that there are separate memory systems for declarative memory (in the medial temporal lobes) and nondeclarative learning (in the basal ganglia). Other studies of the weather prediction task have demonstrated severe impairments in patients with schizophrenia (Keri et al. 2000; T. Weickert, T. Goldberg, A. Terrazas, L. Bigelow, J. Malley, M. Egan, and D. Weinberger, in prep.). Functional brain imaging by Poldrack and colleagues has shown that the medial temporal lobes become active early during learning of the weather-prediction task, and gradually become deactivated as the task is learned; conversely, the basal ganglia are inactive early in learning, but gradually become active (Poldrack et al. 1999, 2001). Computational modeling has illustrated how data on amnesic learning of this task could be explained by a cortico-hippocampal model of associative learning (Gluck et al. 1996). </p>
<p> Part of the appeal of the weather-prediction task has been the assumption that it is a cognitive skill that is learned in a procedural or habit-based (nondeclarative) manner. Another appeal is that the behavioral rules for category learning appear to involve some of the same principles as seen in classical conditioning, a canonical example of motor skill learning (Gluck and Bower 1988a,b, 1990; Shanks 1991). In particular, a powerful model of classical conditioning (Rescorla and Wagner 1972), which describes the incremental trial-by-trial changes that occur during classical conditioning of a CS and a US, also describes changes in associative strengths between cues and outcomes in probabilistic category learning tasks (Gluck and Bower 1988a). Although conditioning and category learning undoubtedly involve different neural substrates, it has been intriguing that they share so many similar behavioral properties. </p>
<p> However, despite considerable interest among cognitive neuroscientists in probabilistic category learning (and the weather-prediction task in particular), relatively little is known about how subjects actually approach this task. Prior studies have assumed that people all learn the task the same way. Because the four cue-outcome associations are probabilistic, it has been assumed that subjects learn these associations incrementally, much as if there were four independent conditioning processes going on in parallel, with subjects' choice behavior on each trial reflecting the accumulated associations among all the present cues. This was, in fact, how this learning was modeled in the Gluck and Bower (1988a) neural network model of probabilistic category learning, as well as in the later Gluck et al. (1996) associative network model. </p>
<p> As such, categorization results are typically analyzed with respect to optimal responding, that is, on each trial, given a particular configuration of cues, did the subject choose the outcome that is most often associated with that pattern over the course of the experiment? </p>
<p> Using such a strategy, subjects would be able to achieve 100% optimal responding. However, in the original weather-prediction study (Knowlton et al. 1994), healthy control subjects averaged only about 70%‚Äì75% optimal responding by the end of the experiment. Thus, it is possible that subjects were only imperfectly following such a strategy. However, it is important to realize that in addition, subjects could potentially use several other classes of strategies to approach the weather-prediction task. For example, in the version of the weather-prediction task used by Knowlton et al. (1994) and others, two of the four tarot cards are highly predictive of the weather, with each being associated with one or the other outcome with ‚àº75% probability. The other two cards are less predictive (associated with one or the other outcome with ‚àº57% probability). Thus, a subject who focuses attention on just one of the highly predictive cards, and then responds sun or rain based only on the presence or absence of this one card, could achieve 75% optimal responses, similar to the level of 75% optimal responding that most subjects in the Knowlton et al. (1994) study actually achieved. Thus, such a strategy could conceivably account for the behavior of subjects in the Knowlton et al. (1994) experiment. </p>
<p> In summary, if one only knows the aggregate percent optimal responses from a subject, it is difficult to conclude anything about how that subject learned the task. Thus, although the amnesic and control groups in the Knowlton et al. (1994) study showed similar percent optimal responding, it is difficult to know whether the two groups were actually using the same strategies or whether qualitatively different strategies might underlie learning in the two groups. </p>
<p> This study presents the development and application of techniques by which we may deduce what strategies a subject is likely to be using on the basis of post-hoc analyses of behavioral responding. These techniques are applied to subjects' performance on two versions of the weather-prediction task, an exact replication of the Knowlton et al. (1994) experiment and a newer version of the task, in which the cue-outcome probabilities are slightly more discriminable. </p>
<p> Experiment 1 </p>
<p> The purpose of Experiment 1 was to evaluate how subjects approach learning in the weather-prediction probabilistic category learning task. Our first experiment is essentially a replication of the weather-prediction task published originally in Knowlton et al. (1994) (Experiment 1, Task 2). Here, in addition, we used questionnaires (Experiment 1A) and mathematical models (Experiment 1B) to assess the strategies subjects used to learn the task. As described above, there are four tarot cards that can each be present (1) or absent (0) on a given trial. Each tarot card is associated with one of two outcomes (sun vs. rain) with a fixed probability, as shown in Table ‚ÄãTable2.2. The overall probablility of each outcome on a given trial is calculated according to the conditional probabilities of each outcome and card occurring together (Table ‚Äã(Table3).3). In addition to recording overall percent optimal responding, we recorded how an individual subject responded to each pattern, and to each cue. Following training, subjects responded to a questionnaire that was designed to provide insight to the kinds of strategies each subject used while performing the task. Mathematical models were developed on the basis of information from the self-reports and the questionnaire, to provide a more objective and accurate strategy analysis. </p>
<p> For each pattern, each card could be present (1) or absent (0). The all-present (1111) and all-absent (0000) patterns were never used. The overall probability of rain, given by summing P (Pattern) *P (rain|pattern) for all patterns, is 50%. </p>
<p> Experiment 1A: Results </p>
<p> Behavior </p>
<p> Over all 200 training trials, subjects achieved a mean 62.41% optimal responses (SD 7.36). Performance is shown in Figure ‚ÄãFigure2A2A across the four blocks of training; subjects started near chance (50%) in block 1, and improved to >70% optimal responding by block 4. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed a significant within-subjects effect of block [F(3,84) = 25.68, P < .001], with no effect of subject gender [F(1,28) = 1.25, P = .273] and no block-gender interaction [F(3,84) = 1.86, P = .142). </p>
<p> Percent optimal responses (A) over all 200 trials, (B) over first 50 trials of training. </p>
<p> Figure ‚ÄãFigure2B2B shows performance across just the first 50 trials. A repeated-measures ANOVA confirmed a significant within-subjects effect of trials [F(4,112) = 3.49, P = .010), no effect of subject gender [F(1,28) = 1.23, P = .278] and no trials-gender interaction [F(4,112) = 0.94, P = .442]. However, as seen in Figure ‚ÄãFigure2B,2B, this effect of trials was due to somewhat better-than-chance responding in the first 10 trials; performance actually fell back to near chance levels for trials 11‚Äì50. </p>
<p> Setting an arbitrary criterion of 65% optimal responding throughout training, 10 of 30 subjects reached criterion performance within 200 trials. </p>
<p> Questionnaire </p>
<p> Within the questionnaire, subjects were asked about the strategy they had used, the cue-outcome probabilities, and the general task structure. </p>
<p> Open-Ended Question </p>
<p> When given an open-ended question asking the subject to describe the strategy used to predict the weather, responses varied widely. Several subjects simply stated that they had tried to ‚Äúassociate the cards with sunny or rainy weather‚Äù or similar. However, many of the more detailed responses fell into a few basic categories. </p>
<p> (1) </p>
<p> One-Cue Learning. Basing responses on the presence or absence of a single card (e.g., ‚ÄúI predicted rain whenever I saw the triangle card.‚Äù). </p>
<p> (2) </p>
<p> Multi-Cue Learning. Basing responses on the combinations of cues present on a given trial (e.g., ‚ÄúI noticed that triangles and diamonds usually meant rain, and the circles and squares meant sunny.‚Äù5). </p>
<p> (3) </p>
<p> Singleton Learning. Learning the correct response to singleton patterns (A = 0001, B = 0010, C = 0100, D = 1000), in which only a single card appears, and guessing on the remaining trials (e.g., Memorizing the single cards, ‚ÄúThe single cards were the easiest, so I concentrated on those.‚Äù). </p>
<p> Additionally, a few subjects reported that they were learning the correct response to singleton patterns, and then adding evidence from singletons together when more than one card appeared (e.g., ‚ÄúFrom the result of one-card incidences [sic] I would learn that a pattern predicted a certain outcome. . . . . If there were two patterns that had caused sun, I would pick that (and vice versa). If there was a card that had predicted sun and one that had predicted rain, I'd guess‚Äù). </p>
<p> The remaining subjects reported that they were guessing, memorizing what weather went with each combination of cards, or using a sequence (e.g., respond sun if the last trial's weather was rain and vice versa). </p>
<p> A total of 22 of the 30 subjects reported that they thought the strategy they had used was good or acceptable. There was no obvious relationship between this response and behavioral performance; subjects reporting satisfaction averaged 62.8% optimal responses (SD 7.2), whereas subjects reporting they did not think they had used a good strategy averaged 61.4% optimal responses (SD 8.3). This was not a significant difference (independent-samples t-test, t(11) = 0.40, P > .500). </p>
<p> Multiple-Choice Question </p>
<p> Following the open-ended question, subjects were given a multiple-choice question in which they were asked which best described the strategy they had used to predict the weather as follows: (a) guessing; (b) noticing that certain cards (which?) most often predicted sun and certain cards (which?) most often predicted rain; (c) memorizing which combinations of cards predicted which kinds of weather. </p>
<p> A total of 22 subjects checked (b); 18 subjects checked (c); 10 subjects checked both (b) and (c). Among those subjects checking (b), only 6 subjects listed all 4 cards. Several subjects also checked (a). </p>
<p> There was no obvious correlation between answers on the open-ended question and the multiple-choice question. For example, one of the subjects who correctly reported all four cards and contingencies in the multiple-choice question had claimed previously to be responding on the basis of picture association, reading cards from left to right. Conversely, another subject who claimed to have learned the four singleton patterns was only able to verbalize (on the multiple-choice) that the square card often predicted sun. </p>
<p> Cue-Outcome Contingencies </p>
<p> Next, we investigated subjects' estimates of association strengths for each of the individual cues [similar to a procedure reported in Reber et al. (1996)]. Subjects were asked four questions of the form, ‚ÄúIf just the square [or circle, diamond, triangle] card is showing, what percentage of the time would it be sunshine? (Respond with a number from 0‚Äì100.)‚Äù. </p>
<p> For every cue, subject responses varied widely; for example, for the square card (highly predictive of sun), estimates ranged from 20%‚Äì100%. As Figure ‚ÄãFigure33 shows, although the group mean of 74.2% for the square card is close to the actual rate of 85.7% sun (see Table ‚ÄãTable3),3), the group mean for the other highly predictive triangle card approached chance (51.5%). No individual subject correctly estimated the probability for all four cues within a range of +/‚àí15% of the actual probability. (In fact, only one subject even came close to this criterion, estimating the four probabilities as 85%, 40%, 30%, and 25%). </p>
<p> Regression analyses of the cue estimates, with total percent optimal responding as the dependent measure, revealed a significant relationship between estimate of P(sun|square card) (ANOVA, F(1,28) = 11.24, P = .002), but not for the other highly predictive triangle card (F(1,28) = 0.66, P = .422), nor either of the less-predictive cards (circle, F(1,28) = 0.33, P > .500; diamond, F(1,28) = 2.71, P = .111). </p>
<p> Subjects were also asked the opposite questions, ‚ÄúWhat if you knew it was going to be sunny [or rainy] and one card was showing? Which card would be most likely to be showing?‚Äù Again, individual responses varied widely, with at least one subject reporting that each possible card was most often present during sun or rain trials. </p>
<p> Overall, 14 subjects (46.7%) reported correctly that the square card was most often present on sun trials, whereas 14 subjects (46.7%) reported correctly that the triangle card was most often present on rain trials. Only six subjects (20%) answered both questions correctly. These six subjects averaged 68.8% optimal responding (SD 7.1), only slightly better than the overall group average of 62.4%. </p>
<p> Questionnaire: Summary </p>
<p> In summary, the results of the questionnaire were highly conflicting. Group averages did not approximate ideal responding, and individual subject responses varied widely, with one subject often reporting different strategies when the question was posed in various ways. There was no obvious correlation between subject strategy and performance, and little good evidence that subjects had learned the cue-outcome contingencies, although they did tend to associate the square card with sun and triangle with rain, when probed to estimate cue-outcome associations. This last finding is generally consistent with the findings of Reber et al. (1996), who found that when probed, subjects, on average, tend to provide relatively accurate estimates of cue-outcome associations. </p>
<p> Experiment 1B: Strategy Analyses </p>
<p> The results from the subject questionnaires suggested that subjects were using more than one strategy to approach the probabilistic categorization task. Some reported using one-cue strategies (responding based on the presence or absence of a single card), or using singleton strategies (learning the optimal response to the four singleton patterns). In fact, if a subject were reliably following one of these strategies, the overall performance rate could approach that obtained by the optimal multi-cue strategy (see below). This suggests that simply knowing a subject's overall performance rate does not necessarily provide any information about which strategy that subject was pursuing. </p>
<p> However, the wide variation within individual subjects among answers to the open-ended question, the multiple-choice question, and the probability estimates suggest that subjects found it difficult to verbalize their strategies. This would be consistent with the assumption that this task taps nondeclarative or implicit memory, and suggests that questionnaire data may be inherently unreliable as an index of how subjects approach the probabilistic category learning task. </p>
<p> We next attempted to derive a more formal method of assessing subject strategies, by quantitatively comparing individual subject data to the ideal subject data that would be expected if a subject were reliably following a particular strategy. On the basis of responses obtained to the questionnaire, we investigated one-cue and singleton strategies, as well as multi-cue strategies, which are often assumed to be how subjects approach this type of task (for example, see Knowlton et al. 1994). Table ‚ÄãTable44 summarizes these four strategies. </p>
<p> Table 4 </p>

<p> Assume the subject is responding based on the presence or absence of one of the less-predictive cues (diamond or circle) and ignoring all other cards. </p>
<p> (% Optimal) = potential performance by a subject reliably following this strategy through the entire experiment. </p>
<p> RESULTS </p>
<p> Over all 200 training trials, we found that 27 subjects (90%) were best fit by a singleton strategy, and 3 subjects were best fit by a one-cue strategy (2 circles, 1 triangle).6 </p>
<p> Our list of potential strategies is clearly not exhaustive, and our strategy analysis clearly cannot prove that an individual subject was following a particular strategy. However, defining a tolerance level of 0.1, all subjects were fit by one of the three classes of strategies we considered. These results do demonstrate that most subjects were behaving in a manner more consistent with a singleton strategy than with a multi-cue strategy. </p>
<p> We also conducted separate strategy analyses for the individual subject data over each block of 50 trials. Figure ‚ÄãFigure44 shows the number of subjects best fit by each strategy across the four blocks. There is a shift in best-fit strategies, such that many subjects are best-fit by a singleton strategy early in training, but gradually come to behave in a manner more consistent with a (more effective) multi-cue strategy. </p>
<p> Percentage of subjects best fit by various strategy models across the four training blocks. </p>
<p> Assuming that block 4 is the best indicator of a subject's ultimate strategy, and most likely to have been reliably followed at least at the end of the experiment, we attempted to correlate best-fit strategy for block 4 with performance. Figure ‚ÄãFigure55 shows that, in general, subjects who were best fit by a multi-cue strategy model tended to generate a relatively high proportion of optimal responses, whereas subjects best fit by a one-cue model tended to generate a low proportion of optimal responses. An ANOVA on block 4 performance with best-fit strategy as the dependent variable revealed a highly significant main effect [F(2,27) = 8.105, P < .001). Tukey pairwise tests revealed that subjects best fit by the multi-cue strategy performed significantly better than those subjects best fit by a one-cue strategy (P < 0.001). No other pairwise contrasts reached significance (all P > .100), that is, there was no significant difference in performance between subjects best fit by the singleton or the one-cue models, or between subjects fit by the singleton or multi-cue models. </p>
<p> Percent optimal responding as a function of best-fit model. </p>
<p> Finally, comparing questionnaire responses with best-fit strategy yielded no obvious correspondences. For example, two subjects who had spontaneously verbalized a one-cue strategy were best fit by a multi-cue strategy. Several subjects whose actual behavior was most consistent with a one-cue strategy verbalized that they had been responding on the basis of information from several cues. Thus, again, there was little evidence that questionnaire data accurately represented how subjects had approached the task. </p>
<p> DISCUSSION </p>
<p> In Experiment 1, we used questionnaires and mathematical models to assess strategies used during training on the weather-prediction category learning task. Findings from the questionnaire suggested that there are various strategies with which subjects approach this task. Three main classes of strategies were identified as follows: multi-cue strategies, in which subjects focus on and learn about all four cues; singleton strategies, in which subjects learn primarily about those patterns in which a single card appears; and one-cue strategies, in which subjects respond on the basis of presence or absence of a single cue. </p>
<p> We developed mathematical models on the basis of these strategies, to obtain a more objective and accurate assessment of the kinds of strategies subjects used while learning this task. Strategy analyses with these models confirmed that subjects use a variety of strategies while learning this task. Specifically, we found that 90% of subjects were best fit by a singleton strategy, over all 200 trials. By investigating strategies within 50-trial blocks, we found evidence of a shift; in the first training block, most subjects appeared to start with a singleton strategy; by the last block, subjects appeared to shift away from a singleton strategy and toward a more optimal multi-cue strategy. This shift toward multi-cue strategy was also reflected in better performance on the final training block (Fig. ‚Äã(Fig.55). </p>
<p> We also found little correspondence between subjects' self reports and their actual performance, as assessed by mathematical analyses. This is interesting, given that self reports are often used to gain insight into how subjects learn. This finding is not really surprising, given that the weather prediction task has always been assumed to be learned in an implicit manner by use of procedural, nonverbalizable rules. This finding further suggests that even when subjects are using a strategy that could, potentially, be verbalized (such as ‚Äúpress sun whenever you see a triangle‚Äù), they may be learning the strategy in a nondeclarative manner. </p>
<p> One important limitation to these findings is that overall, subjects were not performing so well. Two-thirds of subjects were performing at <65% optimal over the 200 trials. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether they were following a specific strategy, changing strategies rapidly in an attempt to improve performance, or perhaps simply guessing. In an attempt to address this, in Experiment 2, we altered the weather prediction task slightly by making the specific cue-outcome probabilities slightly more discriminable, while maintaining the same formal structure of the task. We expected that this would have the effect of making the task somewhat easier to learn (and hence, of improving performance rates) while maintaining the general probabilistic nature of the task. </p>
<p> Experiment 2 </p>
<p> In Experiment 1, we attempted to assess the kinds of strategies subjects use to learn the weather-prediction task. We presented a new technique for examining learning strategies, and identified three main classes of strategies used. However, one limitation of these findings is that the task is quite difficult. The purpose of Experiment 2 was to develop a task that would be formally identical to the Knowlton et al (1994) task in every way, but that nonetheless would be slightly easier to learn. Obtaining slightly higher levels of performance is particularly important, given that this task is often used to assess learning patients with various kinds of memory dysfunction, and poor performance among healthy controls could make the task less sensitive to impairments in patient populations. </p>
<p> In the present experiment, we slightly modified the cue probabilities to make the task easier to master. Specifically, the four cues were associated with sun with probabilities of 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2, which meant that an individual who always responded with the most likely category for each pattern could correctly predict the weather on up to 83% of trials (compared with 76% under the probabilities in Experiment 1). The pattern frequencies and conditional probabilities for Experiment 2 are shown in Table ‚ÄãTable5.5. </p>
<p> Table 5 </p>
<p> Total Frequency of Occurrence of Each Pattern, Along With Number of Times Each Pattern Occurred With Sun or Rain Outcome in Experiment 2 </p>
<p> We expected that subjects would show overall better performance, but that we would find similar patterns of learning as in the original task (i.e., incremental acquisition) and similar patterns of strategy use as revealed by mathematical models. </p>
<p> RESULTS </p>
<p> Overall Performance Measures </p>
<p> Over all 200 trials, subjects averaged 74.5% optimal responses (SD 11.3). Figure ‚ÄãFigure66 shows these data broken into blocks of 50 trials. A repeated-measures ANOVA confirmed significant improvement across trials (within-subjects effect of block [F(3,84) = 12.84, P < .001], with no effect of subject gender [F(1,28) = 0.07, P > 0.500], and no gender-block interaction [F(3,84) = 0.96, P = 0.416). </p>
<p> Percent optimal responses (A) over all 200 trials, (B) over first 50 trials of training. </p>
<p> We also considered just the first 50 trials, divided into sub-blocks of 10 trials. Figure ‚ÄãFigure6B6B shows these data. In fact, there was a slight increase in percent optimal responding across the first 50 trials; however, a repeated-measures ANOVA showed that this was not statistically significant (within-subjects effect of trials [F(4,112) = 0.88, P = .477), no effect of subject gender [F(1,28) = 0.75, P = .393), and no interaction [F(4,112) = 1.02, P = .400). </p>
<p> Setting an arbitrary criterion of 65% optimal responding across all 200 trials, 24 subjects (80.0%) reached criterion performance. This is compared with 33% of subjects reaching criterion in Experiment 1. </p>
<p> Strategy Analyses </p>
<p> Over all 200 training trials, we found that a singleton model provided best fit for 24 subjects (80%), whereas a multi-cue model provided a best fit for 4 subjects (13.3%), and one-cue models provided fits for 2 subjects (6.7%). Defining a tolerance level of 0.1, all subjects but one were fit well by one of the three classes of strategies we considered. </p>
<p> We also conducted separate strategy analyses for the individual subject data over each block of 50 trials. Figure ‚ÄãFigure77 shows the percent of subjects best fit by each strategy across the four blocks. As in Experiment 1, we found a shift in best-fit strategies, with many subjects best fit by a singleton strategy early in training, but behaving in a manner more consistent with a multi-cue strategy later in training. </p>
<p> The percentage of subjects for whom multi-cue, one-cue, and singleton strategies provided a best-fit model for each of the four training blocks. </p>
<p> Finally, we evaluated whether best-fit strategies in the last block were related to overall performance. Figure ‚ÄãFigure88 shows that subjects who were best fit by a multi-cue strategy model tended to generate a relatively high proportion of optimal responses, whereas subjects best fit by a one-cue or singleton model tended to generate a relatively low proportion of optimal responses. An ANOVA on block 4 performance with best-fit model as the independent variable confirmed a significant effect of strategy on performance [F(2,27) = 6.04, P < .010); post-hoc Tukey tests revealed that the multi-cue group significantly outperformed the singleton group (P < 0.001) and the one-cue group (P < 0.050); the singleton group did not differ significantly from the one-cue group (P > .500). </p>
<p> Percent optimal responding as a function of best-fit strategy. </p>
<p> DISCUSSION </p>
<p> In Experiment 2, we used a new version of the weather-prediction task. This version of the task was formally identical to the task in Experiment 1 in all respects, except that the actual probabilities of cue-outcome associations were slightly more discriminable. Whereas in Experiment 1, cues 1‚Äì4 were associated with sun with probabilities of .25, .43, .57, and .75, respectively, in Experiment 2 the corresponding probabilities were .2, .4, .6, and .8. These new probabilities resulted in overall slightly better performance; subjects averaged 74.4% optimal correct performance over all 200 trials in Experiment 2, compared with 62.1% correct performance in Experiment 1. Furthermore, whereas in Experiment 1, relatively few subjects reached a criterion of at least 65% correct responses over all 200 training trials, in Experiment 2, substantially more subjects were able to reach criterion performance (33% of subjects in Experiment 1, compared with 80% in Experiment 2). However, despite slightly better performance, overall patterns of learning were similar‚Äîhere, too, learning was incremental across all 200 trials, and we found a similar pattern of strategy use. These findings are consistent with fMRI findings of similar patterns of activation with both versions (Poldrack et al. 1999, 2001). This version of the weather-prediction task, therefore, appears not to differ from the initial version in any fundamental way, at least in healthy young controls. </p>
<p> General Discussion </p>
<p> The main point of our results is to demonstrate that a task widely used in the cognitive neuroscience literature may not be solved by subjects in the ways that researchers thought previously. In particular, there appears to be considerable variability in how subjects approach this task. </p>
<p> Using mathematical models of three classes of strategies, the multi-cue, one-cue, and singleton strategies, we found that data from all subjects were consistent with one of these strategies, and, in fact, 59 of 60 subjects across two experiments were fit within a tolerance level of 0.1. In both the original and the modified version of the weather-prediction task, the singleton strategy appeared to account for most subjects' data, particularly early in training. There was also evidence of a shift, with many subjects showing behavior more consistent with an optimal multi-cue strategy toward the last block of training. </p>
<p> Because both the one-cue and singleton strategies are simple and easy to verbalize, there is no particular reason to expect that subjects would use nondeclarative memory to mediate learning on the basis of these strategies. However, our finding in Experiment 1 that subjects' actual performance (assessed with models) was poorly correlated with their self reports, supports the idea that even these verbalizable rules are acquired in an unconscious, nonverbalizable way. </p>
<p> Obviously, one cannot definitely assume a given subject was using a particular strategy just because that strategy provided a best-fit model; at least one subject in Experiment 2 was not well described by any of the mathematical models we explored, suggesting that he may have been using a different strategy to approach the task. In future work, it may be interesting to apply clustering techniques, such as multidimensional scaling, to response profile data, to see if we can identify additional or alternate strategy techniques. </p>
<p> Because the weather prediction task is probabilistic and incrementally acquired, it has been assumed in the past that it therefore must depend on nondeclarative (extra-hippocampal) memory systems. In reviewing our results, we feel that it is important to note that just because a strategy can be learned incrementally, it does not necessarily follow that it must be nondeclarative, nor is it the case that just because a strategy can be easily memorized, it must be declarative. </p>
<p> For example, the one-cue strategy can obviously be learned in a nondeclarative, incremental fashion analogous to conditioning to a single cue. However, one can also easily verbalize this strategy using declarative memory: ‚ÄòRespond ‚Äúrain‚Äù whenever the triangle card is present, and respond ‚Äúsun‚Äù whenever it is not present.‚Äô Conversely, just because the singleton strategy is easy to verbalize, does not mean that a person with impaired declarative memory, such as an amnesic patient, should be unable to learn the correct response to each of four stimuli that are presented with very high frequency compared with other stimuli in the task. Thus, we argue that one should be cautious about strong claims regarding which strategies are declarative versus nondeclarative. In fact, it seems plausible to suggest that a normal healthy human may use a variety of strategies and brain substrates‚Äîpossibly in parallel‚Äîto approach a difficult categorization task. Patients with damage to one or more brain systems may be restricted in the strategies they can use to approach this task‚Äîbut to the extent that they can still use at least one effective strategy, they may be able to perform quite well in terms of overall percent optimal responding. In such a case, a gross measure of overall optimal responding may not differentiate a patient group from healthy controls, but a strategy analysis might. Future studies with various patient groups are obviously indicated to determine the extent to which strategy analysis on probabilistic category learning tasks may help elucidate not just how well patients learn, but what they are learning. </p>
<p> METHODS </p>
<p> Experiment 1A </p>
<p> Subjects </p>
<p> A total of 30 Rutgers University undergraduate students participated, and received class credit in exchange for their participation. The group included 13 males and 17 females, with a mean age of 19.8 years (SD 2.9). </p>
<p> Apparatus </p>
<p> Testing took place in a quiet room with the subject seated at a comfortable viewing distance from a Macintosh iBook laptop computer. The keyboard was masked except for two keys, labeled sun and rain, which the subject could use to enter responses. </p>
<p> Stimuli and Procedure </p>
<p> The general procedure was as described previously in Knowlton et al. (1994) (Experiment 1, Task 2), using the same software, cues, and cue probabilities as in the earlier work. </p>
<p> In brief, the subject was required to learn which of two outcomes (rain or sun) was predicted by combinations of tarot cards that appeared on the screen. There were four cards total, as shown in Figure ‚ÄãFigure1,1, each associated with each outcome according to a fixed probability (see Table ‚ÄãTable2).2). One to three cards could appear on each trial. The actual outcome on each trial was calculated according to the conditional probabilities of each outcome and card occurring together (see Table ‚ÄãTable3).3). There were 200 trials total, and the sun and rain outcomes occurred with equal frequency. </p>
<p> On each trial, the cards appeared and the subject was asked to respond with a prediction of sun or rain. Once the subject responded, the correct answer was shown. If the response was correct, a smiley face appeared, a high-pitched tone sounded, and a score bar on the right of the screen increased; if the response was incorrect, a frowning face appeared, a low tone was sounded, and the score bar decreased. Visual feedback and cards remained on the screen for 2 sec, followed by a 1-sec intertrial interval during which the screen was blank. </p>
<p> If the subject did not respond within 2 sec, a prompt appeared, Answer Now!. If the subject did not respond within the next 3 sec, the trial was terminated and the correct answer was shown. </p>
<p> Following the 200 training trials, subjects were given a questionnaire, including both open-ended and multiple-choice questions about the strategies they had used to approach the task, the individual cue-outcome probabilities, and the overall structure of the task. </p>
<p> For the purposes of data analysis, a subject was considered to have made an optimal response if the subject selected the outcome that was most often associated with the current cue pattern, regardless of the actual (probabilistically determined) weather on that trial. Thus, subjects could be scored as making an optimal response on a given trial even if their actual prediction of the weather was wrong. Two patterns (F = 0110 and I = 1001; see Table ‚ÄãTable3)3) appeared equally often with each outcome, and so the optimal response for trials on which pattern F or I appeared was undefined. Percent optimal scores were analyzed in blocks of 50 trials. Additionally, following previous studies, we analyzed data from the first 50 trials in sub-blocks of 10 trials. </p>
<p> Experiment 1B </p>
<p> Ideal response profiles were constructed for each strategy, defined as the expected response to each trial in the experiment if a subject were perfectly following that strategy (see Table ‚ÄãTable4).4). This ideal profile was compared with individual subject data by means of a least-mean-squared-error measure (see Appendix). The strategy generating the lowest error was defined to be the best-fit model for that subject's data. Note that although the scoring for the multi-cue strategy allows for 100% optimal responding, a subject reliably following one of the other strategies could obtain up to 88% optimal responding. </p>
<p> We conducted this strategy analysis for all 30 subjects over all 200 training trials. The actual probabilities of the experiment only hold true across all 200 training trials. However, on the basis of subject questionnaire responses, it appeared likely that at least some subjects had switched strategies during the course of the experiment. Accordingly, we also conducted separate strategy analyses for the individual subject data over each block of 50 trials. </p>
<p> Experiment 2 </p>
<p> Subjects </p>
<p> A total of 30 subjects were recruited from the Rutgers University community, including 17 female and 13 male subjects, with a mean age of 20.73 years (SD 3.64); participants either volunteered or received class credit for an introductory psychology course. All subjects signed statements of informed consent before initiation of behavioral testing. </p>
<p> Stimuli and Procedure </p>
<p> Stimuli were the same as in Experiment 1 and in prior studies (e.g., Knowlton et al. 1994; Experiment 1, Task 2). The two outcomes (sun and rain) were equally probable, but each of the four cards was independently associated with each outcome with a fixed probability: P(sun|card 4) = 0.8; P(sun|card 3) = 0.6; P(sun|card 2) = 0.4; P(sun|card 1) = 0.2. The associations between cards 1‚Äì4 and rain were, accordingly, P(rain|card) = 1-P(sun|card) or 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8, respectively. Trials were then constructed to adhere to these independent probabilities. Table ‚ÄãTable55 shows the number of times each combination of cards (i.e., each pattern) occurred with each outcome. The 200 trials defined in Table ‚ÄãTable55 were presented in a random, but fixed order for all subjects. </p>
<p> The apparatus, procedure, and data collection were identical to Experiment 1. </p>

<p> Strategy Analysis </p>
<p> We investigated three basic classes of strategy that subjects might be using as follows: multi-cue strategies, in which the subject attends to all four cues, one-cue strategies, in which the subject attends selectively to one particular cue (e.g., the presence or absence of a particular card), and singleton strategies, in which the subject learns how patterns containing individual cues (singletons) predict the outcome. </p>
<p> For each strategy, we constructed ideal data, defined as the pattern of responses expected across the 200 trials if a subject were reliably following that strategy. For example, ideal data for a one-cue model based on the square card would assume that the subject responded sun to all patterns in which the square card was present (A,C,E,G,I,K,M), and rain to all patterns in which the square card was absent (B,D,F,H,J,L,N). Ideal data for a singleton model would involve responding sun to singletons A and B, rain to singletons D and H, and randomly to the remaining patterns. (We also initially considered a rule in which subjects responded to multi-card singletons by summing evidence across singletons‚Äîi.e., a majority rule, if two of the three cards are associated with sun, then respond sun‚Äîbut as only one subject was best fit by this model, we do not consider it further.) Ideal data for a multi-cue rule would involve responding to each pattern on the basis of the most frequent outcome, for example, pattern A appears 19 times, 17 sun and 2 rain, so ideal data would involve responding sun each time A appears. These ideal data thus provided various models of subject performance that could be compared against actual subject response patterns. </p>
<p> In practice, no subject's response profile was perfectly identical to any of these ideal profiles. In the early trials, before any learning had taken place, a subject's responses would be expected to be random (or nearly so); later in the experiment a subject might switch strategies‚Äîor even make occasional errors in key pressing. Nonetheless, averaged over all 200 trials of the experiment and over the 4 blocks of 50 trials, many subjects' response profiles were fit quite well by at least one of the ideal data models. </p>
<p> To quantify this fit, we took the squared difference between the number of sun responses generated by a subject and the number predicted by a model, summed across all patterns; this score was normalized by dividing between the sum of squares of total presentations of each pattern, </p>
<p> in which P = pattern A‚Ä¶N; #presentationsP is the number of times pattern P appears in the 200 trials of the experiment; #sun_expectedP,M is the number of sun responses expected to pattern P under model M, and #sun_actualP is the actual number of sun responses the subject made to pattern P during the experiment. </p>
<p> The result was a number between 0 and 1 for each strategy, with 0 indicating a perfect fit between the model M and a subject's response profile. Comparing across all strategies examined, the model generating the lowest score was defined as the best-fit model for that subject. If the best fit was less than 0.1, we concluded that there was evidence that the subject's data could be accounted for by assuming that the subject was following the corresponding strategy. </p>

<p> 5Note that this particular subject's mapping of cues to outcomes is partially incorrect; as per Table ‚ÄãTable2,2, squares and diamonds were most often associated with sun, and circles and triangles with rain. </p>
<p> 6Within the singleton group, one subject was better fit by assuming that she had summed evidence from multiple singletons on those trials in which two or more cards appeared; whereas there were not enough subjects well fit by this model to justify treating it as a separate group, it is worth noting that this is a potentially more sophisticated strategy than simply learning the singletons and guessing on multi-card patterns. However, on the questionnaire, this subject reported that she had been ‚Äúmemoriz[ing] the pattern of the cards and the sequence of how it appears.‚Äù </p>

<p> PM Update: Scattered showers early tonight. Sunny and windy on Sunday. </p>
<p> Summerlike warmth will come to an end over the next few hours, as a cold front sweeps through the region. Showers and scattered thunderstorms will likely stay to our north, but we can‚Äôt rule out some disruption closer to the DMV. High pressure should settle in on Sunday, but winds will stay on the gusty side, which will keep things cooler. </p>
<p> Through tonight: Scattered showers and maybe a rumble of thunder or two will move through in the early evening hours, especially in areas just to the north of Washington. Otherwise, it will be partly cloudy overnight, with temperatures ranging from 45 to 49 degrees. Gusty northwest winds at 10-20 mph will gradually ease overnight, as well. </p>
<p> Tomorrow (Sunday): Sunny skies will dominate Sunday, but there will be a chill in the air with some gusty northwest winds. Temperatures should peak in the mid- to upper 50s, with a northwest wind at 10 to 20-plus mph. Clouds will move in Sunday night, and winds should remain elevated, with lows in the low to mid-40s. </p>

<p> It is windy, sunny, and rainy, etc today or tomorrow.' </p>
<p> Is it okay for the sentences to imply the future weather conditions? </p>
<p> (In the morining, before going to school) </p>
<p> A: Son, It is rainy today. B: What? The weather is so fine and sunny, looking outside now. A: The weather forcaseter said, "Rain will start in the afternoon." ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p> A: I cannot go outside tomorrow because it is rainy and windy tomorrow. B: Me neither. </p>
<p> Hans51Is it okay for the sentences to imply the future weather conditions? </p>
<p> The adjectives themselves can be used with any verb tense. </p>
<p> Hans51it is rainy and windy tomorrow. </p>
<p> 'IS' is wrong with the future, however, as 'present simple' used for future refers to an absolutely certain event‚Äîwhich is never true of the weather. </p>
<p> While I try to figure out meaning difference between rainy and raining, I learned that rainy implies that 'it rains a lot' and then when I decided to choose which word, should I think of amount of rain? </p>
<p> Hans51 I learned that rainy implies that 'it rains a lot' and then when I decided to choose which word, should I think of amount of rain? </p>
<p> No. 'Rainy' refers to a general weather pattern, short- or long-term. If it is a rainy day, it may nevertheless not be raining at the moment. 'Raining' refers to what is happening now. </p>
<p> Hans51Rainy: a rainy day is one on which it rains a lot </p>

<p> Generally, most of us rely on forecasts to tell us what kind of weather to expect. However, it is possible to predict the weather using your skills of observation and knowledge of weather patterns. Not only can predicting the weather be a fun hobby, it can also be a useful skill if you enjoy outdoor activities, such as hiking or camping. By learning what to look for, you can predict the weather without a forecast or technological device. </p>
<p> Detect the direction of the wind. Wind is caused when air moves from a high-pressure area to a low-pressure area. Since weather moves in from the west, westerly winds indicate good weather because they suggest the bad weather is already to your east. Easterly winds suggest that the bad weather is coming toward you.[1] X Research source </p>
<p> You can use grass or flower petals to determine the direction of the wind. Throw your grass or flower petals into the wind and watch the way that it blows or falls. </p>
<p> You can also detect the direction of the wind by wetting your finger and holding it out. The side of your finger that gets cool will tell you from which direction the wind is blowing. </p>
<p> Watch smoke from a fire. The air pressure determines what direction the smoke will go. In high pressure, the smoke will go directly up into the air. If the pressure is low, it will spiral back down around the fire. If you see the smoke spiraling back down, bad weather is likely on the way.[2] X Research source </p>
<p> When smoke spirals downwards, it means that bad weather is very close. The low-pressure system is already in place over your area. </p>
<p> Watch for calm conditions. Before a storm, the low-pressure system can push out the area‚Äôs normal wind patterns. This creates a temporary calm before the storm begins. You‚Äôll notice a lack of wind, which creates a stillness over the area. If you're near water, it will be calm and still, as well. This calm indicates a coming storm. </p>
<p> At this point, you should be able to observe other signs of a storm, such as dark clouds.[3] X Research source </p>
<p> Take a deep breath. Close your eyes and smell the air. Smells become wet right before a storm, making them stronger.[4] X Research source Before a storm, you should also notice a compost smell as plants release their waste. If you start to smell a compost scent, it likely means that a storm is coming. </p>
<p> If you are near a swamp, you will likely smell swamp gases right before a storm.[5] X Research source Swamp gas smells like rotten eggs because it comes from decaying vegetation.[6] X Research source </p>
<p> Check for humidity. High humidity often precedes a storm, so watch for signs of high humidity, such as frizzy hair, curling leaves, and swollen wood. These signs can tell you that a storm is on the way.[7] X Research source </p>
<p> Pine cones can also tell you if it‚Äôs humid because they will stay closed if the humidity is high but will open if the air is dry.[8] X Research source </p>
<p> If you live in an area that always has high humidity, rely on other observations to predict the weather. </p>
<p> Observe ocean swells. If you're near the ocean, look for ocean swells. These swells can be caused by winds that are blowing a storm system from out over the sea. This could mean that rain is on the way.[9] X Research source </p>
<p> Look at the shape of the clouds. The types of clouds in the sky can tell you a lot about the weather. In general, clouds that are white and high indicate good weather, and clouds that are dark and low mean rain or storms are on the way. </p>
<p> White, wispy clouds usually mean that the weather will be clear. </p>
<p> Flat clouds mean that the air is stable, while fluffy clouds mean that it is unstable.[10] X Research source </p>
<p> Smaller puffy clouds may look calm, but they often build over the course of the day. If you see these clouds, it could mean a storm is brewing.[11] X Research source </p>
<p> Observe the position of the clouds. Clouds that look high usually mean that they are farther away but could become a weather threat up to six hours later. Lower clouds mean that bad weather is closer. As the weather threat approaches, you will see the clouds move lower in the sky.[12] X Research source </p>
<p> Check the color of the clouds. Clouds can be various shades of white, gray, black, and brown, and each also means something different about the weather. </p>
<p> Black clouds mean that there is a coming storm that does not have strong winds. </p>
<p> Brown clouds mean that there is a coming storm that does have strong winds. </p>
<p> White clouds usually mean good weather, though a storm could be on its way later in the day.[13] X Research source </p>
<p> Gray clouds usually mean a new or a light storm. However, gray skies mean that the storm is affecting a large area and may remain for awhile.[14] X Research source </p>
<p> Watch the movement of the clouds. The direction that the clouds are traveling can tell you if weather is on the way. Additionally, you should watch if the clouds are coming together or moving apart. </p>
<p> Lowering, gathering clouds are a sign of bad weather coming. </p>
<p> Clouds that are rising and spreading out indicate that the weather is clearing.[15] X Research source </p>
<p> Check for a red sky in the morning. Weather moves from west to east, while the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. If you see a red sky in the morning, then it means that there is clear weather in the east where the sun is rising, but bad weather in the west, making the sky look red. The bad weather from the west will be moving toward you, as that is how weather patterns work. </p>
<p> The redness can appear as a bold orange to a deep red. </p>
<p> If you see a red sky in the evening, you can rest easy. This means that there are clear skies in the west coming toward you, while the bad weather is to the east moving away from you. </p>
<p> You can use the following rhyme: "Red sky at night is a shepherd‚Äôs delight. Red sky in the morning is a shepherd‚Äôs warning."[16] X Research source </p>
<p> Look for a rainbow in the west. A rainbow in the west means that the sun‚Äôs morning rays are striking moisture to your west, which is the direction from which the weather is moving. This means that a storm is moving your way, indicating bad weather later in the day. </p>
<p> If you see a rainbow in the east, then it means that the weather has already passed over you, so clear skies are likely ahead. </p>
<p> Remember the old saying, "Rainbow in the morning gives you fair warning."[17] X Research source </p>
<p> Stare at the moon. Look to see how visible the moon is. If the moon is easy to see in a clear sky, then it could mean that the weather is cooling. It may also mean that a low-pressure system is moving into the area, which clears away dust. This means rain could be on the way. If the moon is visible, look for a wide halo that spreads out from the moon. A halo happens when the moon shines through cirrus clouds, which suggests coming rain.[18] X Research source </p>
<p> Remember the old saying, "Ring around the moon? Rain real soon." A ring around the moon means a warm front is coming, which usually brings rain. The ring is caused by ice crystals that are passing over the moon.[19] X Research source </p>
<p> A double halo around the moon could signal strong winds in the coming storm.[20] X Research source </p>
<p> Another old saying is, "Clear moon, frost soon." A clear sky means that there are no clouds to hold in the earth‚Äôs heat. This means that the weather will be cooler that night and the next morning, even if it‚Äôs not cold enough to frost.[21] X Research source </p>
<p> Count the stars. If you suspect a storm is coming, look at the stars. More than ten stars means that any coming storms should be light, while fewer than ten visible stars means that the storm will be heavy.[22] X Research source </p>
<p> A lack of stars means that there is excessive cloud coverage from an oncoming weather system. If many stars are visible, then the sky is clear. </p>
<p> Look for high ant mounds. Before a storm, ants will build up their mounds and create steep sides. If you see raised ant beds, especially if they were lower before, then there may be a storm coming.[23] X Research source </p>
<p> Watch for low-flying or roosting birds. When the air pressure falls before a storm, birds feel discomfort in their ears. This causes them to fly lower toward the ground or to perch on lower tree branches or power lines. You may also observe the birds eating ground insects. This behavior suggests that a storm is coming.[24] X Research source </p>
<p> If the birds are flying high in the sky, then there will likely be fair weather. </p>
<p> If you‚Äôre near the sea, look for seagulls perched on the beach, which could indicate that a storm is coming. </p>
<p> Watch for large groups of roosting birds. </p>
<p> Birds also become quiet before a storm. Singing and chirping birds could indicate good weather. </p>
<p> Look for bird migrations. Birds can sense air pressure and will time their migrations to good weather. If you see flocks of birds migrating in the sky, then the weather will likely be good that day.[25] X Research source </p>
<p> Notice if birds eat during a storm. If a storm is going to be short, birds will usually wait for the rain to end before looking for food. If you see birds eating during a storm, then it will likely last for a long time. Birds can sense the pressure patterns, allowing them to predict the weather.[26] X Research source </p>
<p> Search for bees and butterflies. Bees and butterflies return to their homes before a storm for safety. In the case of bees, they also work to preserve the hive. If you don‚Äôt see any bees and butterflies when you would expect to - such as in a field of flowers - then there may be a storm coming.[27] X Research source </p>
<p> Check cow pastures to see if they are lying down together. Cows usually gather together and lie down in their pasture before a rainstorm. This is likely because it cools down before a storm, and cows like to be close to the ground when the weather cools. Cows lying on the ground is an indication that it may rain.[28] X Research source </p>
<p> Look for snakes. Snakes will leave their nests before bad weather, even if it‚Äôs in the middle of wintertime. Seeing snakes in unexpected places or at a time when the snake would normally be in its nest can be a sign of bad weather. </p>
<p> Snakes can even predict earthquakes. If you see a snake out of its nest behaving erratically, there could be an earthquake coming.[29] X Research source </p>
<p> Snakes usually come out of their nests in sunny weather to warm themselves. They don't like the cold because they are cold-blooded.[30] X Research source A snake out of its nest when it's not a warm, sunny day is an indication that bad weather is coming. </p>
<p> Watch tortoises if they are nearby. Tortoises will seek higher ground before a storm, so look for movement to higher locations. You may see them in the road one to two days before a rain.[31] X Research source </p>

<p> Community Q&A </p>
<p> Meredith Juncker is a PhD candidate in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center. Her studies are focused on proteins and neurodegenerative diseases. </p>
<p> In most cases, a tsunami will stop when it collides with land. The water will be absorbed into the ground. </p>
<p> How would I survive a tornado or hurricane without shelter? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> If it's a tornado, get into a ditch and get in the fetal position and wait for the storm to pass. If it's a hurricane, you need to get to high ground in case there is any flooding, though you'll need to also be careful that wherever you decide to wait it out doesn't expose you to flying debris or falling trees. </p>
<p> Usually the sky will be dark and may have a greenish tint and the air will become very still. You might see wall clouds or a cloud of debris and there will probably be hail. </p>
<p> When there are sudden, cool gusts of wind, this usually indicates convection currents caused by nearby storms. </p>
<p> There will heavy clouds, and it will be very dark, even if it is midday. The temperature will be quite warm and very humid. </p>
<p> If my dog gets scared before a storm, does that mean there is a chance of a tornado? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> Not necessarily. Dogs have keen hearing. They can hear thunder from a longer distance than humans can. </p>
<p> What kind of weather is associated with a high pressure system? </p>
<p> Community Answer </p>
<p> Usually a clear sky, dry air and sunny, as high pressure makes the air go from high altitudes to the earth. </p>
<p> Animals can't really predict the weather, although they usually can sense when a storm is nearby. </p>
<p> The best shelter from a tornado is a basement or storm cellar. If neither is available, go to an inside room without windows on the lowest level of the building. Cover yourself with something, such as pillows, a mattress or blankets. Place as many walls between you and the outside as possible. </p>

<p> Tips </p>
<p> People with arthritis often report feeling more joint pain when air pressure or temperature drop. </p>
<p> You can also check the grass! Dewy morning grass often means that the weather will be clear that day, while dry morning grass coupled with strong breezes often means a storm is coming. </p>
<p> You can use a weather barometer to measure changes in pressure. Keep a notebook and observe what else happens when the pressure changes. Be attentive, and you might come up with your own weather prediction patterns that are localized to your area. </p>
<p> Warnings </p>
<p> Some types of severe weather, like tornadoes, are very difficult to reliably predict. Be sure to tune in to your local weather forecast to find out how to get to safety if a storm is coming. </p>
<p> Predicting the weather in this manner is not an exact science. Do not risk your life or others' lives because of these experiments. </p>

<p> To predict the weather without a forecast, start by figuring out which direction the wind is blowing. Easterly winds suggest that bad weather is heading your way. Next, watch for signs of high humidity, such as frizzy hair, curling leaves, and swollen wood, which may indicate that a storm is close by. Then, check the shape, color, and position of the clouds in the sky. Dark, low clouds usually mean rain is coming! To learn how you can observe animal behavior to predict the weather, read on! </p>

<p> What do these maps represent ? </p>
<p> The probabilities for the below, near or above normal tercile categories are shown for temperature and precipitation for various lead times, ranging from months 1-3 of the forecast period to months 10-12. In each case, 4 maps and a reliability diagram are shown. The first map displays at each location the probability for the most likely category. (The map for 1-3 month temperatures is reproduced at the top of this page.) In these maps, white over Canada represents regions of "equal chance" where forecast probabilities for none of the three categories exceed 40%, and hence where the categories are nearly equally probable. The occurrence of the white colour areas over Canada is more predominant for precipitation forecasts, which are generally less skillful than temperature forecasts, and increases with forecast range at longer lead times. The increasing occurrence of areas coloured in white over Canada implies diminishing ability of the forecasting system to make reliable and accurate predictions in these regions. </p>
<p> The next 3 maps show the probabilities for each category individually. </p>
<p> Finally, the reliability diagram, also known as attributes diagram, shows, for all locations in Canada, the frequency with which each category occurs (vertical axis) versus the probability with which it was forecast (horizontal axis). Ideally, the observed frequencies should equal the forecast probabilities, in which case the dots in the reliability diagrams would lie along the diagonal dashed line. To improve this property of the forecasts, a calibration method has been applied. To use the forecasts optimally it is strongly recommended to read carefully the user guide! </p>
<p> How are these forecasts produced? The seasonal forecasts are based on a 20-member ensemble of predictions, 10 members from each of two coupled atmosphere-ocean-land physical climate models. The forecast probabilities are estimated by first computing the anomalies or departures from normal for each ensemble member and then applying the calibration procedure to these values. (Forecast probabilities prior to June 2013 were uncalibrated, and obtained by counting the ensemble members in each of the three categories and then dividing by the ensemble size.) </p>

<p> Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, Windy, which would you prefer? </p>
<p> If you can choose a specific weather for a month, which would you choose? The below would be at the highest or lowest temperature) - Sunny - Rainy - Cloudy - Windy </p>
<p> I love rain but for a month, I would choose windy :) as long as it is cooling. </p>
<p> Most Helpful Girls </p>
<p> For me it's a mixture of windy and rainy my favorite kind of weather is severe Thunderstorm... Before anyone looks at me like I'm crazy I know It's serious but most of the time seems to be the least harmful Amd never really causes much damage. </p>
<p> I don't know it's just something about it... I love to stare out the window at the rain fall and hit the window. Listening to it go pitter patter. Watching the wind blow the trees. It's just so peaceful. </p>
<p> For some reason it's relaxing to me, I can think, question, and wonder during it. I listen to soft, soothing, relaxing music during it. I really begin to think and connect and get a really good poem out of it. Last but not least I cuddle with my dog and comfort him because he's terrified of storms and especially thunder. </p>
<p> I'm not sure why but my favorite bad weather is definitely a thunderstorm... I guess it helps me relax instead of panicking like most people during it. </p>
<p> Id like it to be cool and windy. Because the state I live in is hotttt and I really don't like it. So cool and windy will make me happy along with some cloudyness. :) 30-65¬∞F are good tempatures. </p>
<p> Most Helpful Guys </p>
<p> Sunny please... it's winter here and I already see enough gray skies and rain. And long nights... So I need a little sunshine please. Pack some up and send them to me haha :-) </p>
<p> I want sunny, with low humidity and temps around 83F/28C. A gentle breeze is optional but appreciated. </p>
<p> Rain actually.. I sleep better when it's raining/storming outside. I find it soothing and it keeps me in a nice, calm and relaxful state throughout the night. </p>
<p> I'd rather it be snowy. Out of those I guess I'd choose cloudy. I HATE windy days. The wind always pushes me around. Rainy is meh unless jumping in puddles with rain boots. Sunny reminds me of hot weather and I hate it when it's hot... So cloudy. </p>
<p> ... if rainy included thunder storms hell yeah. we never seem to get good storms round here anymore, so I'm kind of achin' for one. </p>
<p> Sunny! I live in England so it'd provide some welcome respite from the dreariness! </p>
<p> i heard it always rain and gloomy like everyday, is this true? </p>
<p> Opinion Owner </p>
<p> +1 y </p>
<p> It's true I'm afraid! Not all of the time, but most of the time. That's why I feel such joy when I go on holiday somewhere sunny! </p>
<p> No but I plan to visit, gonna do a circuit of Australia (Sydney and Melbourne), Japan (Tokyo), Yangshuo (for the climbing) and Singapore! </p>
<p> Sunny with a few clouds and a soft breeze üòé about 83 degrees (Fahrenheit) and somewhat humid </p>
<p> I could take the sun for a month. Temperature wise nothing over + 20 C or under -10 C. </p>

<p> Question: Why is there wind but weather is rainy or sunny and not windy? </p>
<p> I think the graphical weather representation has more variations than the ‚Äûdominant‚Äú weather which is shown as an icon and determins weather boosts. The graphics can show combinations, such as cloudy with a bit of rain, or sunny with wind etc. We see a bit of wind quite often in the graphics, but it‚Äôs rarely the dominant weather unless it‚Äôs actually storming. </p>
<p> It means that the forecast from which Pokemon Go draws its weather information (which I believe to be Accuweather) is forecasting wind, but not of a sufficient intensity to override the other weather. From my experience, forecast wind speeds of about 24kmph tend to override any other weather status to make it windy in-game. From what I can tell, the game only draws from the hour-by-hour forecasts about once every 24 hours, in advance. It used to be around midnight NZ time. If I made a note at midnight of the hourly forecasts for the following 24 hours, the in-game weather matched 99% of the time. I haven't checked it lately, though, to see if the update times have changed. </p>
<p> That is, on purely Cloudy/Partly Cloudy/Sunny days, you can actually get Windy. </p>
<p> But if there's a Hurricane passing through, it's going to be Rain (so long as AccuWeather forecasts rain instead of Cloudy). A Blizzard? Snow, not Windy. </p>
<p> Not clear what it is on Fog; usually Fog doesn't form at all if it's Windy, so, should be pretty mutually exclusive. </p>
<p> The one thing I learned recently and was surprised about is a forecast of Mostly Cloudy w/ Showers by AccuWeather is translated into Cloudy with the secondary rain animation (sprinkling), even when it was windy enough otherwise. The rest of the day was considered Windy, and well above any necessary thresholds. </p>
<p> As title says, there is no chamce in our town to get mew2 boosted or increased spawn of dratini. Yesterday was strong wind but sunny (sunny was in PoGo too) and today is rain with wind (only rain is represent in pogo) What level of tsunami we must have to get windy weather in PoGo? :) </p>
<p> I had windy all day yesterday (no wind at all, rained all morning and sunny all afternoon) and still saw no dratini's :( </p>

<p> PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. ‚Äì Bad weather pushed back The Players Championship, with a Monday finish now a certainty. </p>
<p> The latest postponement came Saturday when The Players announced that play would not resume before noon and gates would not open ahead of that time. </p>
<p> Later Saturday morning, The Players announced play would resume at noon. Fans were encouraged to be mindful of areas where water had accumulated, as well as mounding and hills, which might be slippery. </p>
<p> All fans should dress accordingly and be mindful of areas where water has accumulated, as well mounding and hills, which might be slippery in the current conditions. pic.twitter.com/aGDa6ipa3N </p>
<p> When The Players resumed Saturday afternoon, it was sunny and windy. Fans were excited they didn‚Äôt have to bring their umbrellas or wear their ponchos. </p>
<p> A TPC spokesperson said there was an exceptional turnout Saturday despite the bad weather days prior. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúCertainly experienced a lot of traffic in Ponte Vedra, but I appreciate the people being patient with us as we go through an epic weather event,‚Äù said Jared Rice, executive director of The Players Championship. </p>
<p> The vendors were successful Saturday as well, after being shut down around noon Friday. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúThe community has been awesome. Great crowds today,‚Äù Rice said. ‚ÄúThe average wait at a concession stand was six minutes. Hospitality is having a good time here.‚Äù </p>
<p> Golf fans were excited they didn‚Äôt have to bring their umbrellas and wear their ponchos. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúNo lightning, no rain. The forecast all week said 100 percent chance of lightning and rain,‚Äù golf fan Corey Paul said. </p>
<p> One fan, Gary Gibson, came all the way from Scotland to watch this year‚Äôs Players. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúWe had to go see the golfers. I mean, look at the weather. It‚Äôs fantastic,‚Äù Gibson said. </p>
<p> Ad </p>
<p> A four-hour weather delay Thursday led to a truncated opening round. Friday‚Äôs weather was even worse, with play getting suspended at 11:15 a.m. and the tournament unable to restart again because of steady rain and standing water across the Stadium Course. Play was then suspended at 3 p.m. </p>
<p> PGA Tour chief referee Gary Young said that the tournament is planning for a Monday finish. Young said that he feels confident that the event can wrap up even if The Players went into a three-hole playoff. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúWe are very confident at this point ‚Äî we‚Äôre into a Monday finish,‚Äù Young said. ‚ÄúWe know that. If our calculations on everything hold together and we‚Äôre able to start tomorrow, we certainly expect to be finished with the championship on Monday.‚Äù </p>
<p> There was more than an inch of rain Thursday before the first player even set foot on the course, and rain was steady throughout the early part of Thursday‚Äôs first round. It cleared up for a 3:15 p.m. restart and a good portion of golfers were able to get a chunk of their first round in. Only 66 players finished the opening round. Twelve players didn‚Äôt even hit their first tee shots. </p>
<p> Ad </p>
<p> Weather is expected to be an issue throughout the rest of the golf tournament, including a cold front forecasted for Sunday. </p>
<p> Sunday is supposed to be colder with high temperatures only in the 50s. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúTomorrow‚Äôs supposed to be record lows, so I‚Äôm a little bit scared of cold weather,‚Äù golf fan Jake Johnson said. </p>
<p> But the executive director of TPC said despite the weather, the competition has been great. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúNortheast Florida weather is giving the players everything they can handle. It‚Äôs a great competition,‚Äù Rice said. </p>
<p> Bad weather isn‚Äôt good news for the business side of the tournament though. Two years ago, the pandemic caused the final three rounds of The Players to be canceled. Bad weather this year forces the more than 20 restaurant vendors to lose money. </p>
<p> Ad </p>
<p> Despite fickle Florida weather, there hasn‚Äôt been a Monday finish at The Players since 2005. Fred Funk won that tournament, which was blasted by downpours and 35-mph winds. Funk played 32 holes on Monday and hit a five-foot par putt to win it. Had he missed that putt, the tournament would have gone to a playoff and finished Tuesday. </p>

<p> Rain, Snow & Windy Saturday </p>

<p> Rain to clear over the long weekend, but windy conditions are brewing </p>
<p> Associate professor in meteorology at the University of Pretoria Liesl Dyson said the recent conditions were due to tropical moisture moving over the country. </p>
<p> Cars driving on wet road in the rain with headlights </p>
<p> Weather forecasters expect some of the heavy downpours experienced across South Africa this week to clear up over the long weekend but warn more wet and windy conditions are brewing. </p>
<p> Associate professor in meteorology at the University of Pretoria Liesl Dyson said the recent conditions were due to tropical moisture moving over the country. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúIn the past week or so, a tropical weather system called an Africane was situated over southern Angola and Mozambique,‚Äù she said. </p>
<p> Dyson said an Africane was a large-scale, hurricane-like low that occurred over the southern subcontinent of Africa and supplied ample moisture for rainfall in South Africa. She also said that in the past few days, a cold front had passed over the southern parts of the country. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúThe combination of the two systems caused the heavy rainfall,‚Äù she said. </p>
<p> But South African Weather Service forecaster Tokelo Chiloane said temperatures in Gauteng were expected to rise to the mid-20s this weekend. She said the warm conditions would last until Sunday followed by a significant cooling into Monday. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúLight winds are forecast for the weekend making the conditions perfect to spend [time] outside,‚Äù she said. </p>
<p> This week the South African Weather Service issued several yellow storm warnings for parts of Limpopo, KwaZulu Natal, Mpumalanga and Gauteng. </p>
<p> Tshwane Emergency Management Service spokesperson Charles Mabaso said no flood incidents had been reported in the metro as of yesterday. </p>
<p> And meteorologist at Vox Weather Annette Botha said no weather warnings were issued for Gauteng and the surrounding area for the coming weekend. </p>

<p> Rainy, windy weather temporarily shuts down operations at all three Mt. Hood ski areas </p>
<p> GOVERNMENT CAMP, Ore. (KPTV) ‚Äì The wet, windy weather coming to the Portland and Mt. Hood areas has caused all three ski resorts to pump the brakes on operations for Monday. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúWe have a weather forecast that is bringing high winds, a lot of moisture, we call it an atmospheric river and more commonly known as a pineapple express so there‚Äôs just a whole lot of moisture that‚Äôs lined up for the Cascades,‚Äù said Dave Tragethon, of Mt. Hood Meadows. </p>
<p> Tragethon said they made the call earlier than usual because of the forecasted wind and rain. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve opted to take the unusual step in announcing that we‚Äôre going to suspend operations for Monday,‚Äù he said. </p>
<p> Not long after Meadows decided to temporarily suspend operations for the day, Timberline and Ski Bowl followed suit. Tragethon said at Meadows, if they did try to operate, chances are they would have to close early. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs largely because of the experience that would not be very good on Monday and there‚Äôs some safety considerations too,‚Äù he said. He also said they‚Äôre concerned about people traveling to and from the mountain in these conditions. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúWe feel it‚Äôs best for our team and for our guests to batten down the hatches on Monday,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLet this storm blow through and we‚Äôll see you on Tuesday.‚Äù </p>
<p> All three ski areas plan to resume regular operations Tuesday, conditions permitting. </p>

<p> Spring arrives with mild and windy late-March weather, followed by late-week temperature drop and rain </p>
<p> The first full day of spring arrived to Massachusetts Monday with relatively mild temperatures forecast for a late March day. </p>
<p> After the official Spring Equinox Sunday at 11:33 a.m., Monday marked the first complete day of the new season. The Northern Hemisphere is now more tilted toward the sun than the Southern Hemisphere is, providing it with longer daylight hours. </p>
<p> Today is the official start of Spring: the Spring/Vernal Equinox! 11:33 AM Eastern this morning marked the time when the day-to-night line, called the terminator, was perfectly vertical from pole to pole. #SpringEquinox #FirstDayOfSpring pic.twitter.com/0RyI5FCkNt </p>
<p> For the first day of spring, Boston and Springfield were each expected to hover in the mid-50s, the National Weather Service said. Worcester was forecast to hit 53 degrees by the afternoon. </p>
<p> The temperatures are cooler than expected for the time of year, the weather agency said. Despite clear skies above Massachusetts, the state is also forecast to receive wind gusts up to 35 miles per hour. The National Weather Service said the day would be ‚Äúsunny but blustery.‚Äù </p>
<p> [Monday] Good morning Southern New England! Clear skies early this morning with wall to wall sun today. Still fairly mild by late March standards, but it will be breezy with northwest winds between 25 to 35 mph. </p>
<p> Wetter spring weather is forecast to arrive to the state later in the week. The weather agency said Massachusetts could see ‚Äúsoaking rains‚Äù from Wednesday night through Friday. </p>
<p> Temperatures will also taper off Wednesday and Thursday, with highs in the 40s. But with nighttime low temperatures dropping into the 30s Wednesday, the northernmost areas of the state could see a wintry mix with the arrival of the rain, the National Weather Service cautioned. </p>

<p> Spring Weather Forecast 2022: Rain or Sun? Frost or Flowers? </p>
<p> Subhead </p>
<p> See Our Predictions for the Start of Spring and Beyond! </p>
<p> Michael Steinberg </p>
<p> February 9, 2022 </p>
<p> For spring 2022, we expect warmer-than-normal temperatures. Find out more about weather predictions for your region from The Old Farmer‚Äôs Almanac meteorologist Michael Steinberg. </p>
<p> ADVERTISEMENT </p>
<p> The Almanac‚Äôs Spring Weather Forecast </p>
<p> Spring officially begins, of course, with the spring equinox, which arrives on Sunday, March 20, at 11:33 A.M. Eastern Time. At this time, the Sun stands directly over Earth‚Äôs equator, and we can wake up knowing that we are inching ever closer to the longest day of the year, the summer solstice. </p>
<p> But let‚Äôs not get too ahead of ourselves dreaming of summer weather just yet. First, let‚Äôs talk about what to expect for spring. </p>
<p> What Weather Will Spring Bring Across the United States? </p>
<p> This spring, we‚Äôre expecting to see warmer-than-normal temperatures across much of the United States, except for in Florida and the Desert Southwest, where we‚Äôre predicting that temperatures will be slightly below normal for spring. </p>
<p> Hopefully, by the time Easter arrives on April 17, we‚Äôll have left wintery weather far behind us! </p>
<p> Spring Showers to Bring Plenty of Flowers </p>
<p> Rainfall will be above normal in parts of the South, including Georgia, southern Florida, and southern Texas, as well as parts of the Midwest (Minnesota and the eastern halves of North and South Dakota). </p>
<p> Also expect more rain than normal in a large swathe of the western U.S. stretching from the Intermountain region into the Pacific Northwest, and from Arizona westward into southern California. </p>
<p> Hawaii is also expected to experience above-normal rainfall this spring. </p>
<p> Rain is predicted to be near normal elsewhere in the country. </p>
<p> Springtime in Canada </p>
<p> In Canada, we expect spring temperatures to be above normal across most of the country, but near normal in Atlantic Canada. </p>
<p> Precipitation will be below normal from Atlantic Canada westward through Quebec and above normal elsewhere. </p>
<p> Ladies and Gentlemen, Start Your‚Ä¶ Seeds! </p>
<p> Good news! Warmer-than-normal spring temperatures could mean an early start to the gardening season in many regions. </p>
<p> No matter where you are, be sure to consult our Planting Calendar for suggested seed-starting and planting dates in your area‚Äîand keep an eye out for frost! </p>

<p> I'm amused when I read forecasts that say, higher or lower then normal. There is no normal anymore. </p>
<p> Hoping that climate change doesn't kill my 2 favorite seasons going forward...Fall & Winter....this year no snow in the NYC NE area....Fall was terrible with its lack of color. </p>
<p> The weather conditions of each season make them distinctive and also are so necessary for many perennials and even wildlife. We‚Äôre with you, BigSteve. Thanks for writing! </p>
<p> when will the Northeast see some snow or a blizzard ( states like Pennsylvania, New York, Baltimore, etc. ) ? </p>

<p> Stardew Valley: Every Type Of Weather And Its Unique Effects </p>
<p> Stardew Valley's farmers need to be prepared for all sorts of weather, especially since most of them come with unique effects. </p>
<p> Like any good simulation game, Stardew Valley has randomized weather that changes from day to day, all through the seasons. Other than giving the game a realistic sense of weather, it affects things like farming, fishing, and other game aspects. </p>
<p> The weather changes from day to day as well as with the seasons and it's handy to know when bad weather is around the corner. Thankfully there's the TV screen that shows the weather prediction for the next day, which helps players coordinate their plans for the day ahead. In addition, there are also Rain Totems that players can utilize to usher on a rainy day when needed. </p>
<p> Here's a handy guide to all the weather types in Stardew Valley and the various effects each type has. </p>
<p> 8 Sun </p>
<p> Bright sunshine is the most common type of weather in Stardew Valley, taking up the bulk of Spring, Summer, and Fall, and about half of Winter. On bright, clear days, there are often lots of wild, forageable items spread throughout the map in any of the three seasons. </p>
<p> Additionally, all common fish are available to catch, besides ones that are specific to certain times of the day. Everyone's schedules are pretty steady on sunny days as well, so if players need to get in touch with certain townsfolk it will be a lot easier to find where they are. What can be better than strolling around town and tending crops on a warm, sunny day? </p>
<p> 7 Rain </p>
<p> Rainy days are both convenient and gloomy. What's nice is the rain automatically waters all outdoor crops, which can save players loads of time. But all crops in the greenhouse are unaffected by the rain and still need to be watered. When it rains, all animals will stay inside their barns, which makes total sense. </p>
<p> In addition, during rainfall specific types of fish can be caught, which makes it a great time to round out some Fishing achievements. Rain also alters some of the townsfolk's schedules, so pay attention to where they are when it rains. For example, Sebastian goes to the beach when it rains, as fitting to his character. </p>
<p> 6 Wind (Spring) </p>
<p> Wind, also known as pollen, looks different in the Spring than it does in the Fall. It's basically a normal, sunny day but with pretty flower petals falling from the sky, replicating the effect of wind blowing. </p>
<p> Wind doesn't change too much about the game, besides the aesthetic of the day. It's a nice, stylistic touch that brings texture and quality to Stardew Valley. </p>
<p> 5 Wind (Fall) </p>
<p> Similar to Wind in the Spring, Wind in the Fall is just like a normal day except with leaves falling and blowing around. Again, it brings a really nice aspect to the game and creates an ambiance that is perfect for Fall. </p>
<p> Characters' schedules are not altered and foraging is the same as a regular, sunny day. Windy weather is simply an aesthetic feature in the game that provides no changes to any of the features. </p>
<p> 4 Storm </p>
<p> Stormy weather includes all the same attributes as Rainy weather, except with a few more features. Storms in Stardew Valley are characterized by lightning strikes that occur throughout the day. The lightning can cause trees to fall and crops to be destroyed, which is definitely not a great thing for a well-put-together farm. </p>
<p> The irony is that Storms will still water outdoor crops, even though there's a possibility it can destroy them. Storms also usher in special fish that can only be caught on these days, which makes them great days to get away from the farm and pull out the fishing rod. In addition, only on Stormy days will the Old Mariner appear, just in case players are on the path towards marriage. </p>
<p> 3 Snow </p>
<p> Snowy days make up most of the Winter season when it's not otherwise sunny. Its transparency can be changed in the Options menu, which is a nice feature, just in case players want it to be extra snowy. This type of weather doesn't change too many features of the game, but it is worth noting that Winter seeds still need to be watered on these days. </p>
<p> Falling snow doesn't have the same effect as falling rain, so Winter seeds need to be watered throughout the winter. </p>
<p> 2 Festival </p>
<p> Fitting for Festivals, the weather type on these days will always be clear and sunny, even for the Festivals in the Winter, Feast of the Winter Star, and the Festival of Ice. This is a nice aspect of the game, as these Festivals are times to take stock of the game or just have fun and not be focused on day-to-day tasks. </p>
<p> Sunny, clear weather is appropriate for the Festival days, especially in the Spring and Summer. While it does take away the randomness and accuracy of the game, it does make for very pleasant Festivals. </p>
<p> 1 Wedding Day </p>
<p> One would think that Wedding Days would be sunny and bright, like the Festivals, but unfortunately, the weather follows the randomized algorithm like any other day. This means it's possible that a players' Wedding Day could be stormy, rainy, or even snowy. </p>
<p> If a Wedding Day falls on a Festival Day, the little heart icon will not appear, which is also kind of a bummer. While the randomized weather makes for a more accurate depiction of Weddings, it would always be nice for a bright, sunny day. </p>

<p> Storm Watch: Sunny, pleasant Friday before stormy Saturday </p>
<p> Mar 11, 2022, 3:26amUpdated on Mar 11, 2022 </p>
<p> By: News 12 Staff </p>
<p> Friday will be a sunny and mild day before a bout of rainy and windy weather moves in Saturday. </p>
<p> But before the storm, News 12 Meteorologist Steve Teeling says Friday will be another nice day with partly sunny skies and highs near 50 degrees. </p>
<p> Teeling says Saturday will be rainy and windy to start, with the rain changing over to wet snow during the afternoon before ending. Minor accumulations are possible, especially in northern areas. </p>
<p> The wind stays very gusty in the afternoon and overnight with some of the winds gusting over 50 mph. Some damage and power outages are also possible. </p>
<p> Sunday will be mostly sunny, windy and cold with highs only in the 30s. </p>
<p> OVERNIGHT: Mostly clear and cold. Low of 30. </p>
<p> FRIDAY: Mostly sunny and pleasant. High of 50. </p>
<p> SATURDAY: Rainy and windy with a thunderstorm possible. Turning colder with the rain ending as wet snow. Minor accumulations possible by day's end. Very windy during the day and into the overnight. High of 47. </p>

<p> Timing the snow, ice and rain </p>
<p> Thursday-Thursday night </p>
<p> Snow is likely on Thursday from eastern Kansas into parts of Missouri, Illinois, northern Indiana, northern Ohio and Lower Michigan. </p>
<p> NOAA's Storm Prediction Center said the snow could fall at the rate of 1 to 2 inches per hour in portions of the Midwest. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, a soaking rain will drench areas from the Deep South into the Ohio Valley and interior Northeast on Thursday. The rain might be heavy enough in some spots to result in localized flash flooding. </p>
<p> According to NOAA's Weather Prediction Center, the greatest risk of flash flooding through Thursday night stretches from portions of the mid-Mississippi and Ohio valleys to western Pennsylvania, upstate New York and Vermont. </p>
<p> Forecast for Thursday, Feb. 17, 2022. </p>
<p> (FOX Weather) </p>
<p> High winds are also expected over a large portion of the South, Midwest and Northeast. In parts of the Central Plains and Midwest where snow is falling, that could result in blowing and drifting snow with low visibility. This would make driving conditions even more dangerous than they already would be from the snow alone. </p>
<p> The rain and gusty winds will reach the East Coast Thursday night, including the Boston-to-Washington Interstate 95 corridor. </p>
<p> Enough cold air might arrive overnight for the rain to change over to a period of snow or ice in portions of the Ohio Valley, interior Northeast and northern New England. However, areas near Interstate 95 will likely stay warm enough for all rain. </p>
<p> Forecast for Thursday night, Feb. 17, 2022. </p>
<p> (FOX Weather) </p>
<p> Friday </p>
<p> Rain will continue along the East Coast into early Friday morning before the storm pushes off the Eastern Seaboard later in the morning. </p>
<p> Some lingering snow is also possible in the interior Northeast and northern New England on Friday morning. </p>
<p> However, strong, damaging winds will impact portions of the Northeast coast Thursday night into Friday morning. </p>
<p> High Wind Warnings have been issued by the NWS for parts of New England and Long Island due to the potential for gusts up to 65 mph. Winds of that magnitude can cause tree damage and power outages. The highest risk of widespread power outages and downed trees is from eastern and southeastern Massachusetts into Rhode Island. </p>
<p> Wind Advisories have also been posted for many other areas of the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, where gusts up to 50 mph are possible. That could trigger a few power outages and break some tree limbs. </p>
<p> Wind alerts are in effect across the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. </p>
<p> (FOX Weather) </p>
<p> Snow, ice and rain forecast </p>
<p> A narrow band of 6-plus-inch snow totals is predicted from parts of eastern Kansas to southeastern Lower Michigan, the St. Lawrence Valley of upstate New York and far northern Maine. Up to a foot of snow is not ruled out in some of those areas in the Midwest. </p>
<p> There will likely be a very sharp cutoff in snowfall totals north and south of that heavier narrow band. </p>
<p> Snow forecast through Friday morning, Feb. 18, 2022. </p>
<p> (FOX Weather) </p>
<p> There could also be some light ice accretion from portions of the mid-Mississippi Valley into the eastern Great Lakes. That would cause any untreated roads, especially bridges and overpasses, to become slippery. </p>
<p> Localized tree damage and scattered power outages are also possible in the areas shaded in a lighter pink on the map below, but we do not expect a widespread, disruptive ice storm in this region. </p>
<p> Threat for a glaze of ice in the Midwest and interior Northeast. </p>
<p> (FOX Weather) </p>
<p> On the warm side of this storm, at least an inch of rain is expected over a broad area from the Deep South to the Ohio Valley, southern Great Lakes and parts of the interior Northeast. </p>
<p> Locally higher rainfall totals between 2 and 3 inches are possible in some locations, particularly in the Ohio Valley. </p>
<p> Rain forecast through Friday, Feb. 18, 2022. </p>
<p> (FOX Weather) </p>
<p> Rain forecast through Friday, Feb. 18, 2022. </p>
<p> (FOX Weather) </p>
<p> The rain could lead to flooding in parts of those regions. </p>
<p> As a result, Flood Watches have been hoisted by the NWS from southern and eastern Missouri to the Ohio Valley, southern Great Lakes, northern Pennsylvania, upstate New York and Vermont. </p>
<p> Flood Watches are in effect through Friday, Feb. 18, 2022. </p>
<p> (FOX Weather) </p>
<p> Flood Watches are in effect through Friday, Feb. 18, 2022. </p>
<p> (FOX Weather) </p>
<p> In addition, ice jams are a concern on rivers in the southern Great Lakes and interior Northeast due to warmer temperatures ahead of the storm followed by locally heavy rainfall when the storm arrives. </p>
<p> Snowflakes were seen falling in Denver. Some areas of the Mile High City picked up several inches of snow Wednesday. </p>
<p> The Denver metro area then picked up 3 to 6 inches of snow Wednesday into Wednesday night as the storm dropped south and eastward through the Rockies. The higher elevations west of Denver received up to 8.8 inches. </p>

<p> Historic Temperatures for 29th March in Sunny Beach </p>
<p> Sunny Beach is Bulgaria's most popular seaside resort, sitting in an enviable location on the Black Sea coast. The large, purpose built, resort is located 35 km north of the larger coastal city of Bourgas and close to the ancient town of Nessebar. </p>
<p> Sunny Beach, as its name suggests, has a wonderful climate. With around 300 days of sun a year and summer temperatures of up to 28¬∞C, it definitely deserves the title. Most of Bulgaria has a continental climate, but Sunny Beach witnesses a more moderate climate due to the influence of the Black Sea. </p>
<p> The weather could be classified as moderate continental or maritime, though it also exhibits qualities of a Mediterranean climate, with hot dry summers and cooler mild winters. Rainfall stays around the same throughout the year, with a few days of rainfall per month on average. </p>
<p> Sunny Beach lies in close proximity to mountain ranges and the fresh air that blows down from the mountain peaks is devoid of pollution. As a result, the World Health Organisation recognises the Sunny Beach region as having one of the healthiest microclimates in the world and the climate is thought to be very favourable to those with asthmatic and respiratory conditions. </p>
<p> The resort is extremely popular with tourists looking for a relaxing beach break. Sunny Beach is home to over 500 hotels, which sleep more than 110,000 tourists, and there are over 130 restaurants to fill the thousands of bellies that come with them. The resort town is home to a very small permanent population and mostly shuts down out of season. </p>
<p> Sunny Beach is home to a spectacular 8km long golden sandy beach that is 30 to 60m wide in parts. It stretches around an east-facing semicircular bay. The water is shallow far from the beach making it family-friendly. The beach has also been awarded a coveted Blue Flag, a testament to its cleanliness and good management. It is one of the only places along the Black Sea coast where you can still find sand dunes. </p>
<p> Summer Weather in Sunny Beach </p>
<p> Temperature </p>
<p> Summer is the best time to visit the area of Sunny Beach, as the weather is fantastic and the town bustles with activity. It is also the hottest time of the year. June and September see an average temperature around 20¬∞C which rises to an average daily temperature of 22¬∞C to 23¬∞C in July and August. </p>
<p> In terms of what you will actually experience, this means that in early and late summer you can expect it to get into the low 20s, while in the peak months of July and August you're sure to see temperatures in the high 20s every day. The highest temperatures experienced are generally in July which has a maximum temperature of 28¬∞C. While this sounds quite hot, the breeze off the Black Sea provides relief from the heat in the afternoons so it shouldn't be too uncomfortable. </p>
<p> Sea Temperature </p>
<p> The sea temperature is a pleasant 21¬∞C to 24¬∞C during the summer, which is slightly cooler than in the Mediterranean. </p>
<p> Sunshine </p>
<p> Summer is also the sunniest time of the year in Sunny Beach. June, July and August consistently see 12 hours of sunshine every day, which allows plenty of time for soaking up the rays on the beach just don't forget your sun cream. </p>
<p> Rain </p>
<p> Rainfall is moderate in the summer but falls on only a few days each month. August is the driest month with just 30mm and 4 wet days. </p>
<p> Autumn Weather in Sunny Beach </p>
<p> Temperature </p>
<p> Autumn arrives in Sunny Beach in October. While summer is the most popular time for tourists to visit, early autumn can still be quite pleasant and benefits from being much quieter than the peak tourism season. Temperatures start to decrease in September and by October, averages are around 17¬∞C, falling to 10¬∞C, however, highs can still reach a temperate 19¬∞C at the start of the season. </p>
<p> Sunshine </p>
<p> Sunshine also decreases in autumn, but there's still 6-7 hours of sunshine to be seen every day. </p>
<p> Sea Temperature </p>
<p> While you may still be able to catch a few rays of the resort's beautiful long sandy beach, it wouldn't be advised to swim in the sea at this time of year, as average sea temperatures hover between 15¬∞C and 19¬∞C, which can feel quite chilly. </p>
<p> Rain </p>
<p> It can rain any time of the year in Sunny Beach and rainfall varies little across the year, unlike in Mediterranean resorts which see no rain in the summer and heavy rain in winter. However, November is the wettest month of the year with 56mm and 7 wet days on average. </p>
<p> Rainfall levels are moderate, slightly lower than in London, but unlike in the UK rain falls infrequently in heavy downpours. The locals will tell you when it rains, it pours, so you may be stuck inside for a few hours waiting for the downpour to finish. Afterwards the sky clears and you will be treated to days and days of sunshine. </p>
<p> Winter Weather in Sunny Beach </p>
<p> Temperature </p>
<p> Winters in Sunny Beach get quite cold with an average daily temperature of 2¬∞C in January, and 3¬∞C and 4¬∞C in February and December respectively. Low temperatures can even fall below zero, with the coldest month being January when the weather can fall to -1¬∞C </p>
<p> Sunshine and Rain </p>
<p> Hours of daily sunshine fall to 5 or 6 hours, and the sea temperature cools right down to 7¬∞C at its lowest. Rainfall is around average for the year, with between 41 and 48mm of rainfall each month. </p>
<p> Most tourists come to Sunny Beach to enjoy the beautiful beach and high temperatures of the summer season, and as a result, the winter, with its cold weather, is very quiet. In fact, most of the resort's hotels, bars and restaurants will be closed. If you're looking to visit the resort outside of peak summer season, late spring or early autumn would be best. </p>
<p> Spring Weather in Sunny Beach </p>
<p> Temperature </p>
<p> March marks the beginning of spring in Sunny Beach. The sunshine and high temperatures that Sunny Beach is known for start to arrive in spring, but haven't quite reached their potential. </p>
<p> However, late spring can be good times to visit the resort as there aren't as many tourists, accommodation is cheaper and the temperatures are still pleasant. April and May sees average temperatures of 12¬∞C and 17¬∞C respectively, while highs can reach 21¬∞C by the end of the season. Night times are refreshingly cool, with lows between 7¬∞C and 12¬∞C and cooling sea breezes. </p>
<p> Sunshine and Sea Temperature </p>
<p> While spring and autumn are quite similar in terms of weather, spring is much sunnier than autumn, with 9-12 hours of sunshine, so is a good choice if you're looking for a tan. However, the sea doesn't really warm up until June, so swimming might be off the cards. </p>
<p> Rain </p>
<p> Rainfall is quite stable throughout the month, but does peak in April, the second wettest month of the year, when there's 54mm and 8 wet days. These April showers pass quickly though. </p>

<p> Sunny, rainy, cloudy, windy or a mixture of it - why do you like this weather? </p>
<p> I'm for some months in Malaysia now and i usually live in Germany. With this location change there is also a weather change. Now i don't have spring, summer, autumn and winter. It's all the time summer . The only difference to our summer in Germany is that it's very humid weather in Malaysia. You go out during the lunch time, the sun is burning on your head and the sweat builds a river around your face down to the neck . This is what i don't like. Too sunny and too humid, when you're clothes will be wet after some minutes already. So i choose to go for shopping in the morning before 10 am or in the afternoon after 5 pm when the sun doesn't heat up the air so much and when some clouds are hanging in the sky. For me the best weather is a mixture from sunny and cloudy, then you can be sure that you don't sweat or get too fast a sunburn. (in Germany i like the summer time with temperature not above 25 degrees, otherwise it's too hot and sweaty, time for the swimming pool, yippie!) [b]Which weather do you prefer in your country/foreign country/holidays, why? Do you hate certain weather conditions?[/b] </p>
<p> none of the above.well i like sunny because its too relaxing and i can wear whatever i like and if it is too warm its easy to cool down,just drink plenty of water or going swimming. </p>
<p> Hello bombshell, that's a good example what we could do when it's getting sunny and hot outside, relaxing and swimming. If i would go without water somewhere here in Malaysia, i would be very dizzy after some hours. Here you need to drink more than the usual 2 liters water a day when you sweat that much. Have a great time in myLot! </p>
<p> I don't mind any weather really.The only time it gets me down is when it is really wet for a long time or really hot for two long time.It is nice to get some snow sometimes but as long as it does not last two long,Normally in England it is wet and cold this time of the year,mind you it rained most of last summer it was the wettest for years. </p>
<p> Hello suzzy3, in the end you mind some of the weathers . Sure, if it's rainy all day long and you want to go out, i don't like that, too. Don't want to get a cold because of this. Snow has the disadvantage that you have to carry it away to get along the way to the street or the house. Enjoy your time in myLot! </p>
<p> I like it best when it is somewhat cloudy and breezy, but not too cold. I like it like this because I live in the south where it is really hot, but I am more of a cold-natured person. I love the winter over the summer, and I get really sweaty in the summer, so I prefer the winter because of this. </p>
<p> Hello luvandpower, i think i like the time when it's turning from spring to summer (May) and from summer to autumn (September). In these months it's usually not too cold and not too hot and less windy than in the months before summer and after summer. Have a great time in myLot! </p>
<p> I hated it when I lived in the desert Southwest. It was sunny nearly all the time, hot most of the year and the weather rarely changed. Most people there thrived and loved the constant sun but I got severely depressed. When my marital status changed, I ran back home to the Midwest where we have four wonderful seasons. By the time I'm tired of one season, the next one comes along and it is heaven for me! I don't like the weather to be the same all the time. </p>
<p> Hello dragon54u, sometimes it's quite nice not to have the change of the seasons. In Germany it's usually very cold in the mornings when i went to work during spring and autumn (winter, too ) and at lunch time it could be really warm outside. What to wear on such days ha ha. It's easier in Malaysia, just take the shirt and a short trouser (when you go into cinema, take long cloths and a jacket, the air con can be very cold ) and go. Have a great time in myLot! </p>
<p> I love it when it's windy. I just feel so much better when it is. Like I'm free of everything, that nothing can get the best of me, like anything magical could happen. It's almost like flying, without the fear of heights! I dislike hot and humid. You can only take off so many clothes. The bugs are out in force, and too many of them want to suck your blood. (And they aren't handsome like vamps in movies!) </p>
<p> Hello snowcat46, i have problems when it's windy. Then i have to protect my ears otherwise they will get sick, even in the car when the air condition is on and blows into my ears, i could be sick after some days . That's why i need it usually warm, a warm wind would be ok, like you have it in some regions. The bugs or mosquitos are already here in Malaysia, this week i got bitten by them several times a day, very itchy, luckily mostly on my feet. Enjoy your time in myLot! </p>
<p> Hello carinio, i like it when the rain is over, then the air is really fresh again and the heat is away for half an hour. Time for a good walk in the cloudy sunshine . Have a great time in myLot! </p>
<p> I love the sunny weather. I like feeling heat on me, instead of anything else. Idon't like rain, it makes me so tired and grumpy, and I can just tell it's going to be a bad day. When it's sunny, you can go out and do a lot. you don't have to be cooped up all day in your house. Where I live it doesn't get overly hot. We have all four seasons, and summer has always been the best. I don't feel all sticky and sweaty. </p>
<p> I like it when it is hot in the evening and cool Around 60 degrees at night. That is perfect for me. I grew up in a wrestling room so the heat is nothing to me. I love it! </p>
<p> I love it when it is sunny, but not humid. I think the worst weather is windy or cold! Can't really do much outside when he wind is blowing like crazy, you either have to hold everything down or it blows away! Can't even have a nice hairdo on these day! </p>
<p> I like winter and fall and spring as not to hot. Some of the winter I can live with out but it is still ok. I live in the USA. So where I live I get all four. Summer I don't care for when hot. spring I like everything is turning green. and then fall when the leaves change colors and then of course winter when it gets all white and pretty. Oh and the cold I could live without but then it wouldn't be winter. You have a good day. Your friend onlydia </p>
<p> i like cloudy.. because it's neutral.. neither hot nor cold.. im living in a tropical country and the main weather here is summer.. and the stroke of the sun makes my tempered hot, I easily get irritated!.. so when it gets cloudy, it makes me feel relax, calm.. i want to go out when it's cloudy but i always bring my umbrella with me.. incase that cloud will produce a rain.. </p>
<p> hey, you are just gone the opposite site from mine. I come to Russia from Malaysia I can understand what you are saying about the humid and hot weather, also that is why i do not like the summmer in Malaysia too. I prefer summer in Russia or Europe, they are almost the same, dry and nice cool breeze and the sun go below 30 degree. which is so much better than Malaysia's summer they could go above 30 degree. hehe, so In Russia I prefer Summer, but I hate the winter here, is sometimes too cold and everywhere would be covered by thick snow and slipeery. after all there are the fun part like we could go outdoor activities like iceskating and iceskiing. it makes me want to go back to malaysia though or travel to europe just to escape the winter. i would choose over summers in malaysia for sure than staying back for cold winter. </p>
<p> hiya cornyman, I most definitely like a sunny day, not to hot, not to cold, so spring and autumn tend to be my favorite times of the year. I have arthritis in my knee and can usually tell when its going to rain. My knee starts to throb. The humidity from the summer months and the dampness from the winter months causes me a lot of pain and agony. You never mentioned snow in your post, so I would like to make a little comment on it if I may...I don't like the snow at all. We've had quite a bit of snow this year. Great if you're an outdoors person and like to ski, but I'm not. I find it difficult to walk in the snow because of my bad knee, so I have to be extra careful at this time of year when walking. Anyways, time to Bring On Spring...Such a lovely time of year when everything starts to come to life again. ~proudnana~ </p>
<p> i go out on a cloudy weather..i love before the rain aroma of indian soil which makes you feel nature fresh.... </p>
<p> Hi Cornyman, I like the weather to be sunny with some cloudy and windy. I will go back to my home town today, and I will start to drive about 2 or 3pm, and it needs about 4 or 5 hours to drive. So this is the weather I like when I am driving. </p>
<p> I am from India so well i will prefer winter sesion as because it would be cool and well i prefer going out any where it would be better, in summer its too hot nearly the temperature reaaches to 45 degree. so well for me i like winter then all other seasions. </p>
<p> I live in Maine, USA and it always seems to be winter here . . . which I don't really care for. I don't mind bundling up and being snuggly, but I don't like being cold whenever I want to go anywhere. I also really don't like driving on roads that are covered with ice and snow all the time. Yuck. I love it when it's spring, and the weather is cool enough to wear a comfortable sweater. I also love the blooming flowers, the trees coming back to life, and the freshness of the air. </p>
<p> I prefer summer rainy days. I wouldn't mind just going out there and playing in the rain. It really is fun. And its a good nap day. </p>
<p> Sunny is my weather. On sunny days, I feel light hearted, quick in thinking and swift in doing. I take full advantage of the weather to do lots of washing. The clothes get dry quickly, so pleasing to a housewife. The worst weather is just before the rain. Because of humidity and low air pressure, my body gets sore all over. Strange enough, once it rains, I will get better. </p>
<p> I like the sunny/ cloudy weather because it¬¥s more comfortable but makes me feel a little depressed don¬¥t know why. Makes me want to stay the whole day on bed. Here in Fortaleza where I live is always too sunny. So I am used to it, not so comfortable because it¬¥s too hot but makes me feel so alive and this is good. </p>

<p> Sunny, very warm and windy weekend ahead </p>
<p> CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas ‚Äî A weak boundary moved through the Coastal Bend yesterday afternoon and reinforced another round of some dry air in South Texas. </p>
<p> This has resulted in cool mornings and warm afternoons. Today will be no exception to that as we start the day with temperatures mainly in the 40s and 50s and afternoon highs will soar well into 70s along the coast and 80s and 90s for our inland communities. </p>
<p> We‚Äôve had increased fire danger over the last couple of weeks and, luckily, for today we‚Äôll see a little less wind that will result in elevated fire weather conditions. However, we do not have any fire weather watches or red flag warnings in place. Still, the community should continue to do their part by reducing any outdoor activities that involve sparks and/or flames. Vegetation is still dry and with the dry air that‚Äôs in place, a wildfire can easily spread if ignited. </p>
<p> The upcoming weekend looks fantastic. We‚Äôll have afternoon high temperatures well above seasonal average in the mid to upper 80s along with increasing wind. That increasing wind will, of course, raise fire concerns, but it will be coming in off the Gulf and that will slowly begin to increase humidity over the region as well. </p>
<p> By early next week, winds will be gusting to obnoxious levels, and we‚Äôll see sustained values around 25-35 MPH with gusts approaching 40-45 MPH. </p>
<p> The 6WEATHER Team is keeping a lookout for some rain chances and as we head into the middle of next week, another upper-level storm system will approach from the west. At this time, it doesn‚Äôt look to dig far enough south to give us big rain chances. However, we‚Äôll keep a few isolated showers, favoring our northern regions, by late Tuesday and into Wednesday. </p>
<p> Today: Cool AM, mainly sunny and very warm PM with less wind; still elevated fire danger‚Ä¶High: 87‚Ä¶Wind: SW/SE 10-20 MPH. </p>
<p> Tonight: Increasing clouds and increasing humidity, still cool and pleasant‚Ä¶Low: 54‚Ä¶Wind: SSE 5-10 MPH. </p>
<p> Saturday: Mainly sunny skies with a few more clouds and increasing winds which will lead to elevated fire danger‚Ä¶High: 87‚Ä¶Wind: SSE 15-25 MPH & gusting. </p>
<p> Sunday: Still plenty of sunshine with warm temperatures, windy and elevated fire danger‚Ä¶High: 85‚Ä¶Wind: SSE 15-25 MPH. </p>
<p> Monday: Gusty winds resulting in high fire danger along with very warm temperatures and lots of sunshine‚Ä¶High: 83‚Ä¶Wind: SSE 15-30 MPH & gusting. </p>
<p> Tuesday: Partly to mainly cloudy skies, gusty winds resulting in high fire danger; keeping an eye on storm system out west to result in a few isolated showers for northern areas late in the day‚Ä¶High: 83‚Ä¶Win: SSE 15-30 MPH. </p>
<p> Wednesday: Early morning isolated showers for northern areas, Pacific front moves in from the west, still very warm and windy out ahead of boundary with early afternoon clearing‚Ä¶High: 87‚Ä¶Wind: WNW 15-25 MPH & gusting. </p>
<p> Have a great weekend be safe! </p>

<p> 33 Words and Phrases for Talking About the Weather in English </p>
<p> Afraid of thunderstorms? </p>
<p> Like to dance in the rain? </p>
<p> Find the sunshine beautiful? </p>
<p> Many of us keep the Weather Channel bookmarked and ready on our computers or phone. We know how important it is to stay up-to-date on the latest weather news. </p>
<p> In this post, you‚Äôll learn all the terms you need to describe sunny days, stormy days and all those in between‚Äîas well as why the weather is considered such a hot topic. </p>
<p> Even at more formal occasions, like business meetings or other professional settings, weather is a popular topic for small talk. </p>
<p> That might be due to the fact that the weather is often different from day to day and from place to place, making it a relevant subject for everyone. To fully participate in these conversations, you‚Äôll need lots of English words and phrases in your vocabulary. </p>
<p> Also, knowing weather-related terms is important for your safety! Imagine you‚Äôre in a local restaurant and the waiter casually tells you, ‚ÄúBe careful of that fog when you go over the bridge.‚Äù You‚Äôll be glad you know what the word fog means! </p>
<p> How to Talk About the Weather in English with All the Right Vocabulary </p>
<p> There are so many adjectives you can use for describing the weather. Some of them are very similar in meaning (i.e., hot and warm) and a little harder to distinguish, while others are completely different (i.e., rainy and sunny) and easier to remember. </p>
<p> In addition to learning these terms, you should consider practicing them often‚Äîsmall-talk with native English speakers is the perfect opportunity! </p>
<p> Now let‚Äôs get to those common terms you‚Äôll need to talk about all kinds of weather. </p>
<p> 16 Vocabulary Words You‚Äôll Need to Talk About the Weather </p>
<p> Hot / Warm </p>
<p> When we say it‚Äôs hot, we‚Äôre referring to very high temperatures, like you find in the middle of summer when the heat can get quite uncomfortable. When it‚Äôs warm though, temperatures are fairly high but bearable. </p>
<p> When the weather is warm, I prefer light clothing like t-shirts. </p>
<p> Today is so hot that I‚Äôve been sitting under the fan all day. </p>
<p> Cold / Cool </p>
<p> Cold refers to very low temperatures, close to freezing‚Äîthe type of weather that requires a heavy coat to go outside. With cool, however, we‚Äôre talking about fairly low, spring-like temperatures when you may only need to wear a sweater out. </p>
<p> On cool days like today, you should be fine with a light jacket. </p>
<p> Don‚Äôt forget your coat; it‚Äôs cold outside. </p>
<p> Sunny / Rainy </p>
<p> Sunny weather means there‚Äôs lots of sunshine. Its opposite is rainy weather, which means lots of rain. </p>
<p> On sunny days, I like to take the kids to the beach. </p>
<p> Rainy days are the best time to stay home and read a book. </p>
<p> Clear / Cloudy </p>
<p> A clear day is bright with no signs of bad weather. A cloudy day, however, means the skies are filled with clouds with little or no sun. </p>
<p> Isn‚Äôt it great that we‚Äôre having such clear days this week? </p>
<p> It looks cloudy; you should bring an umbrella in case it rains. </p>
<p> Dry / Humid </p>
<p> When it‚Äôs dry, there‚Äôs no rain or moisture in the air. But when it‚Äôs humid, the air is moist and contains a large amount of water vapor. Humid weather usually makes us perspire (sweat) more. </p>
<p> Bush fires are common around here when the weather is dry. </p>
<p> The weather‚Äôs been so humid lately it‚Äôs impossible to go outside without breaking a sweat. </p>
<p> Foggy / Misty </p>
<p> These two adjectives refer to hazy conditions caused by small droplets of water in the air that make it difficult to see. Fog (noun) forms closer to the ground and is thicker and more difficult to see through. Mist (noun) usually forms on hills and mountains and isn‚Äôt as thick. </p>
<p> Be sure to turn on your headlights when driving through foggy areas. </p>
<p> It‚Äôs misty up in the mountains in the mornings. </p>
<p> Gusty / Windy </p>
<p> These adjectives describe the wind. Gusty suggests a sudden brief burst of wind while windy refers to a stronger than usual wind blowing. </p>
<p> It‚Äôs been gusty all afternoon and my umbrella was blown away. </p>
<p> As we were walking along the beach, it started to get windy. </p>
<p> Thunder / Lightning </p>
<p> These two nouns are often used together when referring to storms. Thunder is the loud booming sound which usually follows a flash of lightning in the sky. </p>
<p> Whenever there‚Äôs thunder and lightning, my dog rushes into the house in fear. </p>
<p> 17 Questions and Phrases to Talk About the Weather </p>
<p> Whether you‚Äôre at the coffee machine or waiting your turn at the post office, chances are you might get into a casual conversation with the person next to you about what‚Äôs going on outside. </p>
<p> Here are some phrases to help you prepare. </p>
<p> How‚Äôs the weather? / What‚Äôs it like out there? </p>
<p> Both of these are good questions to ask if you haven‚Äôt gone outside in a while, and you‚Äôre wondering if things have changed. </p>
<p> Or maybe you‚Äôre still debating about whether or not you want to venture (go) outdoors, so you might ask this to someone who comes inside. </p>
<p> What‚Äôs the temperature like (out there)? </p>
<p> This question is asking about degrees in Fahrenheit or Celsius. However, people are typically looking for an approximate temperature: </p>
<p> It‚Äôs around 40¬∞. </p>
<p> Of course, an answer like the following is still acceptable: </p>
<p> It‚Äôs really (hot/cold/warm/cool). </p>
<p> What‚Äôs the weather forecast? </p>
<p> If you‚Äôre planning a trip or event, you might want to know the weather ahead of time. Forecast simply refers to what kind of weather is expected in the coming days or weeks. </p>
<p> What a [beautiful] day! </p>
<p> Use other adjectives like nice or gorgeous to make your descriptions more interesting. </p>
<p> It‚Äôs [warm and sunny] outside. </p>
<p> This is a simple sentence using two or more descriptive adjectives. </p>
<p> It‚Äôs warm and windy outside. </p>
<p> Blue skies is a phrase meaning a sign of good weather: </p>
<p> There‚Äôs nothing but blue skies outside. </p>
<p> We couldn‚Äôt ask for [better] weather. </p>
<p> Here the use of the comparative adjective better suggests that the weather is so good that it couldn‚Äôt get any better. You could use other comparative adjectives like nicer or more beautiful. </p>
<p> We couldn‚Äôt ask for nicer weather this week! </p>
<p> This is the (best/worst) weather we‚Äôve had all [season/week/year]! </p>
<p> The superlative adjective best is used to show that this weather is simply the best and nothing else can be better. Here‚Äôs another example: </p>
<p> This is the most beautiful weather we‚Äôve had all week! </p>
<p> This is the worst weather we‚Äôve had all spring! </p>
<p> [Awful] weather, isn‚Äôt it? </p>
<p> Using the question form can be quite refreshing especially when you expect the person to agree with you. You could use similar adjectives like nasty or terrible instead. </p>
<p> Nasty weather today, isn‚Äôt it? </p>
<p> It‚Äôs [boiling] hot! </p>
<p> The word boiling is used here as an adjective, not as a verb, to create an image of how hot it is. You could also use adverbs like extremely or really. </p>
<p> It‚Äôs [freezing] outside! </p>
<p> In this simple sentence, you may use any verb in its -ing form to describe the weather such as pouring (raining very heavily) or sizzling (very hot). </p>
<p> I can‚Äôt believe this [weather]! </p>
<p> Here‚Äôs a simple way to express your surprise. Feel free to use any other suitable noun such as storm or wind. </p>
<p> It‚Äôs raining cats and dogs! </p>
<p> This is a popular idiom (expression) for saying that it‚Äôs raining heavily. Have fun with it. </p>
<p> It looks like [rain]. </p>
<p> Here you‚Äôre saying it looks like it might rain in the near future. It could be that you can see dark clouds or hear thunder. You could use other nouns like snow or a storm. </p>
<p> [A storm] seems to be [coming/heading] this way. </p>
<p> The phrase seems to be suggests that a storm is likely to be coming. You could also say: </p>
<p> Heavy rain seems to be heading this way. </p>
<p> The weather will be warming up soon. </p>
<p> Warming up means the temperatures will be rising and it‚Äôs getting warmer. The opposite of that would be: </p>
<p> The weather will be cooling down soon. </p>
<p> It‚Äôs expected to be [hotter] than last year. </p>
<p> The phrase expected to be suggests that you think it‚Äôll happen. Use a comparative adjective here to compare the weather now with another time in the past. You could use other comparative adjectives like colder or less windy. </p>
<p> So there you have it‚Äîa great list of weather words and phrases to get you talking about the weather like a native speaker. I expect you‚Äôll warm up to (get used to) these sentence structures pretty quickly and use them in your own words. </p>
<p> While knowing this vocabulary is a big step forward, understanding the nuances of how native speakers actually use these terms is even more important. That‚Äôs where a resource like FluentU can come in. This language learning program uses authentic English videos to teach you new words as well as culture by focusing on context. </p>
<p> So remember to actually practice the words, phrases and questions in this post so you can feel comfortable actually using them in conversations. </p>

<p> The 20 funniest and most fitting names in weather </p>
<p> Meteorologists and weather presenters boast some of the most colorful names of any profession. In some cases, the names stem from the showmanship which is part of their jobs. But in many cases, their given names are coincidental, suggesting perhaps they were always destined for weather greatness. </p>
<p> Here are the top 20 names in weather and meteorology‚Ä¶ </p>
<p> Ray Ban </p>
<p> He holds no relation to the popular sunglasses brand, but worked as an on-air meteorologist on The Weather Channel in the 1980s and later served as executive vice president. He has since retired and provides consulting services to the weather media industry. </p>
<p> Richard ‚ÄúHeatwave‚Äù Berler </p>
<p> ‚Äú‚ÄòHeatwave‚Äô is the nickname that was given to me by my meteorology classmates in my freshman year of college when they saw that I liked it hotter than Florida,‚Äù Berler says in his station bio. He is the chief meteorologist at the NBC affiliate in Laredo, Texas. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> Story continues below advertisement </p>
<p> Sam Champion </p>
<p> ‚ÄúChampion is his real name and has been for generations,‚Äù notes the San Francisco Chronicle. Champion was a weathercaster at ABC and Good Morning America for 25 years before jumping to The Weather Channel, where he is managing editor. He has a prime time interview-format show, called ‚Äú23.5 degrees with Sam Champion‚Äù, debuting next week. </p>
<p> Sonny Daye (deceased) </p>
<p> If ‚ÄúSonny Daye‚Äù seems like a name too good to be true for a weatherperson, it is. Daye, who presented the weather in the 1970s and 1980s, actually was named Leon Fred Pettersen. He passed away in 2012. </p>
<p> ‚Äú[Y]es, ‚ÄúFreeze‚Äù is her real name!,‚Äù says her bio. She is a meteorologist at the ABC affiliate in chilly New York City. </p>
<p> Sunny Haus </p>
<p> Haus‚Äô actual name is Steve Wolhenhaus, but he was ‚Äúforced‚Äù to take on the stage name ‚ÄúSunny Haus‚Äù for the NBC affiliate in Minneapolis in the late 1980s, according to the Star Tribune. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúThat Sunny Haus to me is absurd,‚Äù Wolhenhaus said. ‚ÄúI mean it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous. ‚Ä¶ Right now it‚Äôs a little painful [too]. You kick yourself in the head. I obviously didn‚Äôt have to accept that.‚Äù </p>
<p> Wolhenhaus left the TV weather business and runs the private weather company, Weatherology, which is based in Minneapolis. </p>
<p> This name has celebrity written all over it. A local TV time icon in Los Angeles, Mountain was a weathercaster at its ABC affiliate for 27 years and CBS affiliate for five before retiring. </p>
<p> Previously he worked in Houston. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt deny that KHCW‚Äôs Casanova Nurse is one of the best names in Houston broadcasting right now,‚Äù Houston media commentator Mike McCuff wrote at the time. </p>
<p> Story continues below advertisement </p>
<p> Dallas Raines </p>
<p> A larger than life Los Angeles personality, this ABC meteorologist is known for some of his on-camera moves including ‚ÄòThe Crouch‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Whirl‚Äô, ‚ÄòThe Swing‚Äô, and ‚ÄòThe Pump.‚Äô </p>
<p> Leon ‚ÄúStormy‚Äù Rottman (deceased) and Rob ‚ÄúSunny‚Äù Roseman </p>
<p> According to his station bio: ‚ÄúEarlier in his career a colleague saw footage of Schwartz being blown around in a storm and dubbed him ‚ÄòHurricane.‚Äô The nickname stuck and he has been known as Hurricane ever since.‚Äù Schwartz, with his trademark bow-tie, is the chief meteorologist at the NBC affiliate in Philadelphia. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúHis birth name is Philip Howard Spiceland but his parents always called him Flip,‚Äù writes the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Spiceland worked on-camera as a weathercaster for CNN for 21 years and the Atlanta NBC affiliate for seven. </p>
<p> He left TV and now works for the United Way in public relations. ‚ÄúHe said when he calls companies to remind them about United Way contributions, people have called the area director to make sure it wasn‚Äôt a joke,‚Äù the Atlanta Journal Constitution says. </p>
<p> From his name to his hobbies, everything about Sundgaard seems to trace to his high latitude roots. He likes traveling to Scandinavia, listening to ‚Äúanything by Coldplay‚Äù and is a meteorologist at the NBC affiliate in Minneapolis. </p>
<p> Harry Wappler (deceased) </p>
<p> How great is it when a TV station can name its weather radar after its weathercaster? The CBS affiliate in Seattle, where Wappler worked for 30 years, called its radar the ‚ÄúWappler Doppler‚Äù. Wappler is remembered as ‚Äúthe dean of Northwest weathercasters‚Äú. He passed away in 2010. </p>
<p> Elizabeth ‚ÄúBetsy‚Äù Weatherhead </p>
<p> Holding a Ph.D. in geophysical sciences and an esteemed researcher, Weatherhead boasts plenty of weather brain power. She works at the University of Colorado, specializing in ‚Äúthe evaluation of forecasting techniques, developing new measurement approaches, and statistical analyses of data‚Äù. </p>

<p> Weather: Heavy rain, strong winds, thunderstorms for Northland, Auckland, North Island </p>
<p> 20 Mar, 2022 12:22 AM5 minutes to read </p>
<p> Strong winds in Auckland have already caused issues for boaties, and there's worse to come as northeasterlies buffet the coastline. Video / Matthew Davison </p>
<p> NZ Herald </p>
<p> Heavy rain, severe gales and thunderstorms are set to lash parts of Aotearoa from today as a low-pressure system moves in from the Tasman Sea. </p>
<p> Strong winds in Auckland have already caused issues for boaties, and there's worse to come as northeasterlies buffet the coastline. </p>
<p> The Coastguard was called to several water-related incidents in the early hours of this morning. </p>
<p> One vessel had been unable to anchor and another grounded after it was pulled from its anchorage by the winds. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> MetService this morning upgraded its forecasts, adding heavy rain warnings for Auckland, Coromandel and the Bay of Plenty. </p>
<p> Severe thunderstorm watches are also in place for Northland and Auckland in addition to heavy rain warnings, while severe gales are possible in Auckland. </p>
<p> The rain could create surface flooding and slips, and strong winds could snap tree limbs and whip up rough seas along the east coast, according to forecasters. </p>
<p> Parts of Northland are already getting rain, but the deluge is forecast to really set in from midday, when an orange heavy rain warning is in place. Some areas could see a total 100-140 mm of rain by 9am Monday, MetService's severe weather update says. </p>
<p> "Downpours can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips," MetService warns. </p>
<p> "Driving conditions could be hazardous, with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain." </p>
<p> A severe thunderstorm watch for Northland lasts from 1pm today to 3am Monday. </p>
<p> Severe thunderstorms could see localised downpours of 25-40mm/h, and patches of torrential rain of more than 40mm/h. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> "While possible tornadoes may cause some structural damage, including damage to trees and power lines, and make driving hazardous," MetService said. "If any tornadoes occur, they will only affect very localised areas. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, Auckland can expected a cloudy Sunday with scattered showers, but rain will develop from the north this afternoon. Strong northeasterly winds are forecast, with gusts of 90km/h possible from later today. </p>
<p> Red sky in the morning, sailors warning. High cloud covering large parts of the country this morning, this has made for a very picturesque start to the day. But as this blog explains is a precursor to some wet weather https://t.co/7rxS0loQbG. Thanks @raveen_das for the shot ^KL pic.twitter.com/zZv1jnrZLd </p>
<p> Heavy rain warnings, strong winds could hit gale strength later this evening </p>
<p> The heaviest rain in Auckland and Great Barrier Island is due from 10pm tonight, particularly north of the Harbour Bridge. </p>
<p> A heavy rain warning is in place from 10pm until 2pm Monday with 80-110mm of rain possible over that time. The city is also under a severe gale watch for the same time period. </p>
<p> The Coastguard was called to several water-related incidents in the early hours of this morning. </p>
<p> Advertisement </p>
<p> An emergency call was made by a yacht near Okahu Bay in the WaitematƒÅ Harbour at 4.53am after they were unable to anchor their vessel because of strong north-easterly winds and a damaged rudder. </p>
<p> Pilot Vessel Wakatere and volunteers from Coastguard Auckland came to the yacht's assistance and towed it to Wynyard Quarter. </p>
<p> A yacht also called for assistance at 3.28am after strong winds pulled it from its anchorage in McKenzie Bay and it ended up grounding on Calliope Bank. </p>
<p> Quick actions of the skipper meant the vessel was able to self-rescue, a Coastguard spokesman said. </p>
<p> The Coromandel Peninsula and Bay of Plenty west of ≈åp≈çtiki are also under heavy rain warnings for Monday, while Kaikoura, Waikato, Waitomo, parts of Gisborne, Taumarunui, Taup≈ç, parts of Taranaki and Tasman west of Motueka are under heavy rain watches. </p>
<p> Niwa is also warning eastern coastal areas will be buffeted by strong northeasterlies today and tomorrow, with potential for tree limbs to come down and rough seas to be whipped up. </p>

<p> üõë An atmospheric "stop sign", or blocking high pressure system to the east, will keep it near the country til Thursday! pic.twitter.com/M993IHJWEy </p>
<p> The rainmaker will also affect the northwestern edge of the South Island, particularly Buller. But the east coast and lower part of the South Island are expected to remain dry, MetService forecasts. </p>
<p> Weatherwatch said the forecast for early next week was for "unstable" weather, with downpours likely and a chance of thunderstorms. </p>
<p> "This is the result of very moist warm air at the surface and cold upper air," the forecaster said. </p>
<p> "The exact placement of these storms at this stage is a little hard to define but anywhere about the upper and western North Island looks to be in with a chance, especially as frontal zones and troughs move through. </p>
<p> "Monday and Tuesday still look to have reasonably strong wind dynamics so a small tornado is also a possibility." </p>

<p> Contents </p>
<p> Weather types </p>
<p> Sunny/Clear </p>
<p> A sunny day, or clear sky during nighttime, is when there are clouds above the horizon. If one is at the top of a mountain or travel in a plane, possible clouds and fogs don't count as long as they remain below the horizon level. This also means that the sky is always sunny/clear above the highest altitude at which clouds can generate, which is about 85,340 meters (53 miles). Sunny days are bought by anticyclones. </p>
<p> Sunny weather can help temperatures to rise under the Sun's influence but a clear sky during the night allows temperatures to significantly drop, especially in winter, as heat is radiating from the surroundings and there is no cloud cover to keep it from escaping to space; the decrease in temperature keeps going until an hour after sunrise. Thus, sunny weather causes the most important variations in temperatures within the same air mass. </p>
<p> Sunny/clear weather is commonly found in deserts. Tops of mountains also enjoy plenty of sunny days since few clouds reach them; this is why the most powerful telescopes were built in mountains. However, sunny/clear weather is quite rare for the rest of the world. There is practically no sunny/clear day under the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone since it rains almost on a daily basis. </p>
<p> Partially cloudy </p>
<p> Partially cloudy weather is when some clouds are hovering above the horizon level; however, most of the sky remains clear and there is no precipitation of any kind. The clouds may temporarily drop the temperature when they hide the Sun during the day, which is particularly helpful during a heatwave. </p>
<p> Cloudy </p>
<p> Cloudy weather is when a significant amount of clouds is covering the sky (at least half the sky). A cloudy day may result in some weak showers, snowfalls, or even thunderstorms, although a thunderstorm temporarily overcasts the sky as it happens. </p>
<p> Overcast </p>
<p> Overcast weather is when the sky is completely covered by a cloud blanket. Days are significantly dimmer and nights are completely dark without artificial sources of light. If cirrus or cirrostratus are covering the sky, the Sun or Moon may remain visible, and daytime is slightly brighter than with a stratus cover; however, the latter is far more common than the former. Depending on the type of clouds and time of the day, an overcast sky may appear white, light grey, grey, or dark blue during sunrises/sunsets. </p>
<p> The cloud cover prevents temperatures from either dropping or rising too sharply, decreasing the differences in temperatures between the different parts of the day. Sometimes, the temperature can remain the same the whole day. </p>
<p> Rain </p>
<p> Rain is the condensed moisture of the atmosphere above falling under the form of liquid droplets. It is an extremely important phenomenon that allows life to flourish on continents; without regular rains, the land turns into a hot desert. However, strong rains can also cause catastrophic floods, capable of destroying areas as large as an entire metropolis. In addition, rain causes other side effects such as slippery roads, longer braking distances, decreased visibility (pseudo-fog)... Episodic rains that last only a few minutes are called showers. </p>
<p> Rain intensity is often measured in millimeters (or inches); an mm of rain corresponds to a liter of water over a square meter. Typical rains give less than 5 mm (0.1 in) per hour; however, there are also torrential rains that can give way more than a hundred millimeters (4 in) per hour; the record of rain amount in an hour is 305 mm (12 in)! </p>
<p> Drizzle </p>
<p> Drizzle is similar to rain, but the droplets are very small and hardly noticeable with the naked eye. Drizzles are always weak, but they also limit visibility. Drizzle may precede or turns into a fog. </p>
<p> Snow </p>
<p> Snow is atmospheric water that froze and fell to the ground, covering it. It happens when the temperature of the air falls at 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F). Snow remains as long as the temperature of the ground doesn't go beyond 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F). </p>
<p> Snow may be appreciated by children, but it causes much worse problems than rain, as it makes roads impassable and walking difficult, may block the entrances of houses, and may even destroy cars and rooftops with the weight of the snow accumulated on it. Snowfalls also decrease visibility way worse than rain, and if accompanied by strong winds, we talk of blizzards. In mountains, large packs of snow may slide over the slope they lie in, causing an avalanche that is the deadliest event associated with snow. Also, snow melting can cause some floods: for example, a meter tall (3 feet) snow blanket melting usually turns into a 10 cm (4 in) puddle. Despite this, snow is important during the cold season as mountain stations rely on it to bring in tourists. </p>
<p> The height of the snow blanket is often measured in centimeters (or inches). Snow can already cause accidents at 1 cm (0.4 in), and driving may become impossible at 10 cm (4 in); walking becomes particularly difficult beyond 15 cm (6 in). However, some snowfalls can bring up to a meter (3 foot) of snow, especially in mountains. </p>
<p> Snow is characteristic of mountains and remains permanent at higher altitudes (‚Äúeternal snows‚Äù). Snow also happens quite frequently under continental climates during the cold season, such as in Eastern Europe and Russia. It is however much rarer in mild climates and only happens during a limited window of time, usually around the coldest month of the year, although early or late snow can also take place there if an exceptionally cold front was to sweep over said regions. It never falls under hot climates, especially around the equator. </p>
<p> Stormy </p>
<p> A thunderstorm is a type of weather characterized by lightning. There are produced by the largest and tallest clouds that can spawn, the cumulonimbus. Thunderstorms are also accompanied by strong gusts of wind, heavy rainfalls, and sometimes hail and tornadoes, which are the most destructive meteorological event. A thunderstorm, regardless of its intensity, is always a dangerous phenomenon that should be taken seriously as lightning can cause great bodily harm, and sometimes even kill, anyone unfortunate enough to be hit with. </p>
<p> Thunderstorms can happen everywhere but are extremely rare around the poles. In mild climates, they happen especially during late spring, summer, and early autumn. They are very frequent in mountains during the whole year, as well as in tropical and equatorial climates. </p>
<p> Tornadoes </p>
<p> Tornadoes are rotating air columns spinning at a very high speed. They are born under supercell thunderstorms, which are a specific kind of cumulonimbus that is spinning on itself. Tornadoes act as a sort of ‚Äúnatural vacuum cleaner‚Äù, aspiring then projecting everything it can take on its path. Tornadoes swallow dust and debris that make them visible the day and, depending on the materials swallowed, make them light grey, grey, or even brown. The night, tornadoes are normally invisible making them much more dangerous and threatening, but lightning can reveal their existence and position. Tornadoes make also a lot of sounds, especially the strongest ones, which can help identify them with little to no visibility. </p>
<p> Tornadoes are ranked by the Enhanced Fujita scale, which takes into consideration the damages caused by the tornado, to determine its speed. Most tornadoes do not produce winds faster than 200 km/h (124 mph), although these winds can already kill an unprotected person and destroy a house. </p>
<p> The 1999 Bridge Creek tornado produced the strongest winds officially recorded on Earth, at 512 km/h (318 mph), which is about 40% of the speed of sound. However, the 2013 El Reno tornado, which was the largest tornado that ever occurred (with a diameter of 4.2 km (2.6 miles)) may have produced winds as strong as 541 km/h (336 mph), which is approximately 44% of the speed of sound. Both of these tornadoes destroyed everything in their paths, although the El Reno tornado, fortunately, didn't cross urbanized areas. </p>
<p> Since tornadoes are extremely dangerous, it is important to be on the lookout for one if supercells are predicted for your area. Tornadoes can occur pretty much everywhere in the world, but they mostly appear within mild climates. </p>
<p> Thundersnows </p>
<p> Thundersnows are extremely rare variants of thunderstorms, in which snow falls instead of rain or hail. Thundersnows tend to be very weak compared to common thunderstorms, and also last shorter, although lightning can still pose a deadly threat. </p>
<p> Fog </p>
<p> Fog is literally a cloud at ground level, which raises ambient humidity to its maximum, and considerably decreases visibility. The threshold of visibility at which we talk of fog is a kilometer (0.6 miles), but some fogs can decrease visibility up to 20 meters (65.6 foot). If visibility is greater than 1 km (0.6 miles), we talk of a mist. Fogs can happen anywhere, even in deserts, but happen more frequently in cold, humid climates. Depending on the moment of the day, they sport various shades of grey, varying from light grey at solar noon, to dark grey at the sunset. </p>
<p> Fogs make biking and driving particularly dangerous, especially if the visibility is less than 100 meters (328 feet). In some countries, speed limits are reduced when a fog happens. For instance, in France, the speed limit is reduced to 50 km/h (31 mph) if a fog decreases visibility to less than 50 meters (164 foot). Regardless of the speed limits, many drivers choose to drive fast which can cause severe accidents, especially on highways. In some countries, meteorological warnings are emitted if a fog is predicted to take place. </p>
<p> Hurricanes </p>
<p> Cyclones, hurricanes, and typhoons design the same phenomenon, for different parts of the world. They are structured and large systems of clouds under which winds blow at more than 119 km/h (74 mph). They possess a zone of calm, sunny weather, called the eye, in which pressure is at its minimum. Winds are the strongest and most devastating around the eye. </p>
<p> Hurricanes form over hot spots of water in the ocean (which must be at 26.5 ¬∞C (80 ¬∞F) minimum; the higher, the stronger will the hurricane be), and also cannot form near the equator (precisely at less than 5¬∞ of latitude of the equator), since they must use the Coriolis' force to organize into a round-shape storm. They eventually either converge to terrestrial lands in which they cause damages but lose their strength, or more rarely disappears in the ocean if the water becomes too cold to sustain them. </p>
<p> Hurricanes can cause devastating damages over large areas (unlike a tornado), especially in small islands and coastal areas. In addition to the winds, hurricanes also deliver strong rains, and coastal areas are impacted by hurricane surges, which are an elevation of the sea level as pressure drops under a hurricane. The elevation can climb up to 6 meters (20 foot), which is sometimes deadlier than the hurricane's winds themselves, as seen with Katrina. </p>
<p> Sandstorms </p>
<p> Sandstorms are large surges of sand and dust carried away by strong winds, which take the form of a dull brown wall seen from far away. Sandstorms are normally not lethal but the amount of sand makes any outdoor activity very difficult, and breathing may become unbearable with the number of particles in the air. Sandstorms usually happen in hot deserts, but exceptional weather patterns can allow sandstorms to sweep over non-desertic regions. </p>

<p> Storm Aiden: Heavy rain and winds hit UK </p>
<p> Heavy rain and strong winds are hitting the UK as Storm Aiden sweeps in from the west, bringing risks of flooding. </p>
<p> The Met Office says all of the UK will get wet and windy weather thanks to the storm on Saturday and the tail edge of a hurricane on Sunday. </p>
<p> Yellow weather warnings for rain are in place for Ireland and the west coast of England, Scotland and Wales, with wind warnings in some areas. </p>
<p> There could be power cuts and travel disruption in those areas. </p>
<p> Yellow weather warnings for rain are in place until 19:00 GMT on Saturday for Ireland and the west coast of England, Scotland and Wales, where travel disruption and potential power cuts are expected. </p>
<p> There is also a yellow warning for wind in place in Northern Ireland and western parts of Wales, Scotland and England. </p>
<p> The bad weather could last much of the weekend, and people have been urged to pay attention to the weather forecast as well as flood alerts and warnings in their area. </p>
<p> Martin Young, deputy chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said: "As the heavy rain and strong winds from Storm Aiden sweeps eastwards on Saturday, another system quickly follows on Sunday that contains the remnants of ex-Hurricane Zeta, bringing further heavy rain and strong winds. </p>
<p> "Given that this is falling on already saturated ground from what has been a wet October, there is an increased risk of flooding in some warnings areas." </p>
<p> Another yellow warning for rain covering Wales and north-west England is in force from 18:00 GMT on Sunday to 06:00 on Monday, and some communities could be cut off by fast flowing and deep floodwater. </p>
<p> Hilly areas could see 40-60mm (1.6-2.4 inches) of rain on Saturday, with 20mm-40mm ( 0.8-1.6 inches) in lower-lying areas. </p>
<p> Gary White, the duty tactical manager for Natural Resources Wales, said flooding was likely up and down the country over the next few days. </p>
<p> Very strong winds could also affect north-west Scotland between noon and 21:00 on Sunday, including the possibilities of power cuts and delays for high-sided vehicles and public transport. </p>
<p> The Met Office said there could be gusts of 60-65mph (97-105km/h), up to 70mph (113km/h) on exposed coasts and hills. </p>
<p> During the day they will ease across England and Wales but they will stay strong across Scotland and Northern Ireland into the evening, and there could be gusts of 75mph (121km/h) across the Western Isles and up to 70mph on the west coast. </p>
<p> Lifeguards rescued a man at 05:00 GMT on Saturday morning after his yacht was capsized by a "large freak wave" off the Isles of Scilly, south-west England. </p>
<p> Falmouth Coastguard's helicopter and an RNLI lifeboat rescued the French man and his 34-foot yacht six miles from the coast. </p>
<p> Ian Guy, duty controller at the National Maritime Operations Centre, said the yachtsman described being hit by a "large freak wave" which capsized, rolled and disabled the vessel. </p>

<p> Speaking to Express.co.uk, weather forecaster Jim Dale said that the UK can expect the hot weather to come in "fairly early" this year, with temperatures reaching their highest point in the middle of the month. This is much higher than the UK average for the month, in which temperatures typically reach a daily high of around 12C in April and a low of 4C. But Mr Dale told Express.co.uk that spikes in temperature like this are becoming increasingly likely as a result of global warming. </p>

<p> Speaking about the impact of global warming on UK temperatures, Mr Dale, senior meteorologist at British Weather Services, said: "Longer-term, given what's happening globally in terms of the temperature profiles in the southern hemisphere and what's also happening in the United States, I would not be surprised if we started to see some big highlights - in whichever direction it goes, either cold or hot. </p>

<p> "It's too difficult to be certain at this moment, but I would not be surprised to see the Summer deliver the same kind of heat stress at times." </p>
<p> Mr Dale said that the UK will begin to see some milder weather at the end of February, but it will be mixed in with colder spells. </p>

<p> Weather forecast UK latest ‚Äì Britain to be COLDER than Iceland as Met Office reveals EXACT date snow to fall this week </p>
<p> BRITS are set for snow and ice as early as THIS week as temperatures are to become colder than ICELAND. </p>
<p> Temperatures have soared to 21C in the past few days, but parts of the UK could dip to as low as -3C before the snow starts to settle. </p>
<p> From Wednesday a band of snow will move down from the north and blanket Scotland and the northern parts of England in around four inches of snow. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúIt will be markedly colder than what we‚Äôve just seen, daytime temperatures falling by half, and some areas will even struggle to hit 8C (46.4F), which will signify the biggest change in conditions.‚Äù </p>
<p> Met Office forecaster Alex Burkhill said of the extreme change in weather: ‚ÄúWednesday will be the most extreme in terms of wintry weather, as a cold stream of air will start to push southwards bringing unpredictable wet and windy conditions, even snow or sleet. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúOvernight into Thursday and Friday, many areas will fall considerably lower than freezing, towards minus 4C (24.8F) and minus 5C (23F). It looks like most places will be impacted; parts of northern England, northern Wales and central England are expected to be the worst affected. </p>

<p> Showers, likely wintry at times, will affect many northern and eastern areas. These showers could be heavy at times. </p>
<p> Elsewhere, many areas are likely to be dry, with frost widespread by night. </p>
<p> High pressure is likely to decline through the weekend, with spells of rain possibly pushing southeast across the country by the end of the weekend or the beginning of the following week. </p>
<p> Further spells of rain, with milder temperatures, interspersed with colder, showery interludes, will likely follow for the rest of the period. </p>
<p> A change is on the way‚Äô </p>
<p> Met Office Chief Meteorologist Paul Gundersen said: ‚ÄúAlthough the UK has had a good deal of fine and settled March weather in recent days, a change is on the way from the middle of next week with colder air spreading down from the north and the increasing likelihood of rain for most areas. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúOn the hills in the north, there‚Äôs a chance of this falling as snow, although we‚Äôll gain more certainty on that in the coming days. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúWith the influence of some unsettled weather, we‚Äôll be seeing a marked drop in temperatures for most with colder air arriving from the north. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúThis will see maximum temperatures drop into single figures for many areas, and below freezing overnight.‚Äù </p>
<p> Drop in temperatures poses risk to nation‚Äôs gardeners </p>
<p> The drop in temperatures is a risk for some of the nation‚Äôs gardeners. </p>
<p> The Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Guy Barter said: ‚ÄúColder weather will slow plant growth and inhibit plums and pears pollination as insects fly less in cold dull weather. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúHard frosts don‚Äôt seem likely so magnolias and fruit flowers should escape serious damage. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúLimited rain will help new sowings of peas and carrots for example and newly planted lettuces and other plants but should not greatly delay sowing and planting once conditions improve. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúTender plants, petunias and tomatoes for example, won‚Äôt be put outside for another month at least but lower light affects greenhouses and will slow their growth.‚Äù </p>
<p> Marked shift in weather during the coming weeks, says expert </p>
<p> Met Office Chief Meteorologist Neil Armstrong said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be seeing a marked shift in the weather for the UK in the coming week as the warm weather is displaced south. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúTemperatures will drop as cold air sweeps south with single figure maxima for most places from mid-week, and bringing with it the unsettled weather that we‚Äôll see for much of the week. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúSome clear spells are still around later in the week, with the best of any sunshine likely to be in the south later in the week.‚Äù </p>

<p> Band of snow to move southwards from Wednesday </p>
<p> From Wednesday a band of snow will move down from the north and blanket Scotland and the northern parts of England in around four inches of snow. </p>
<p> By Thursday it will have moved over northern parts of England, possibly dumping up to nine inches according to WX Charts. </p>
<p> Two or three inches of snow will settle on the ground in Wales later in the week, and Northern Ireland should also see some flurries. </p>
<p> This afternoon's weather 'looking rather messy' </p>

<p> Odds SLASHED on April being wettest EVER </p>
<p> Ladbrokes has slashed the odds for the second time this week on next month going down as the wettest April EVER. </p>
<p> Having been a 2/1 shot on Monday, the bookies now make it just 6/4 for this year to play host to a record-breaking wet April. </p>
<p> Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: "Things are about to get a whole lot wetter as far as the latest odds are concerned, with a record-breaking April potentially on the cards." </p>

<p> "Overnight into Wednesday and Thursday, many areas will fall considerably lower than freezing, towards -6C." </p>
<p> Two or three inches of snow will settle on the ground in Wales later in the week, and Northern Ireland should also see some flurries. </p>
<p> Unpredictable wet and windy conditions this week </p>
<p> Official Met Office charts show temperatures dipping as low as -1C in Loch Rannoch, Scotland, on Thursday morning. </p>
<p> However forecasters have warned the mercury could plunge as low as -6C in parts as a bone-chilling cold front pushes down from the north. </p>
<p> Alex Burkill, a Met Office forecaster, said: ‚ÄúWednesday will be the most extreme in terms of wintry weather, as a cold stream of air will start to push southwards bringing unpredictable wet and windy conditions, even snow or sleet. </p>
<p> "Overnight into Thursday and Friday, many areas will fall considerably lower than freezing, towards -4C and -5C. </p>

<p> What to plant in April </p>
<p> Speaking to Express, gardening guru Chris Bonnett, from GardeningExpress.co.uk, explained that April is the time of the year when our green spaces really begin to ‚Äùcome to life‚Äù. </p>
<p> A must for the ultimate brunch staple, Eggs Benedict, chives are to be planted in the sunny month of April as well. </p>
<p> ‚ÄùTry planting chives and other herbs and letting them germinate on a sunny window sill or in the greenhouse,‚Äù the whizz said. </p>
<p> He also added: ‚ÄùTake care though to sow them sparingly, thinning them out if they become overcrowded.‚Äù </p>
<p> The last chance to do these gardening jobs (2/2) </p>
<p> While your garden will start to thrive with warmer weather, you will also notice an increase in pests such as slugs. </p>
<p> William said you should be preparing preventative measures for this before April arrives. </p>
<p> He explained: ‚ÄúThis can be done using natural deterrents like coffee grounds, wood ashes, or sand but can also be done by purchasing products that keep away the slugs using chemicals.‚Äù </p>
<p> The last chance to do these gardening jobs (1/2) </p>
<p> William Mitchel from Sutton Manor Nursery told Express.co.uk that there are a number of last-minute jobs to tackle in March. </p>
<p> William said that you should cut back your plants to make your outdoor space not only visually attractive but also to allow for newer shoots to come through. </p>
<p> He explained: ‚ÄúIt is very important to get rid of, or cut back any overgrown grasses or perennial plants that have built up over the winter months and become an eye-sore.‚Äù </p>
<p> You should prune flower shrubs like buddleia, clematis, hebes and hydrangeas, and take off dead flowers so you are left with healthier outward-facing bulbs. </p>

<p> UK weather forecast LIVE: SNOW ‚Äòreturn next week‚Äô with freezing Icelandic air to send temperatures plunging as low as -7 </p>
<p> A 'WINTRY blast' is coming from Iceland to the UK this weekend with chilly -8C winds and more rain. </p>
<p> The Met Office has warned that "more changeable weather conditions" are expected over the next 5 days. </p>
<p> Later in the week this could reach as low as -7C and Brits have been urged to 'dig out their winter coats' to prepare for the chilly conditions. </p>
<p> Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Frank Saunders, said: ‚ÄúA cold front, followed by cold arctic Canadian air, has now pushed south across the country and has brought a spell of windy, showery and cold weather. </p>

<p> Driving in sun glare during the winter </p>
<p> Here are our tips so you can drive safely in the Winter sun. </p>
<p> If you‚Äôre not properly prepared, it can cause serious accidents, and if the sun is in your eyes, you may not see pedestrians, cyclists or fast breaking traffic. </p>
<p> To improve vision and reduce the risk of accidents when there is sun glare: </p>
<p> Keep a pair of sunglasses in the car, preferably polarising ones </p>
<p> Use the sun visors to provide better contrast for your eyes </p>
<p> Clean your windscreen thoroughly, both inside and out </p>
<p> Check and replace your windscreen wiper blades if they‚Äôre worn, damaged, or more than a couple of years old </p>
<p> Slow down if you‚Äôre dazzled </p>
<p> If the sun‚Äôs in your eyes it‚Äôs likely to be blinding drivers behind you too, which means you need bigger gaps to allow for delayed braking reactions </p>
<p> Up to 30mm of rain to hit England and Wales today </p>
<p> Up to 30mm of rain is expected to hit England and Wales today, with snow also coming in flurries as temperatures plunge to -7C later in the week. </p>
<p> Wednesday is expected to bring cloud and rain, continuing into Thursday, with the band of rain moving east on Friday. </p>
<p> The Met Office added there are no storms with the potential of becoming named on the horizon. </p>
<p> It comes after the country was battered last week by Storm Eunice and Storm Franklin. </p>
<p> A major incident was declared earlier this week with evacuations taking place amid expected floods. </p>
<p> UN climate change report likely to paint a grim vision‚Äô for big cities </p>
<p> Mark Watts, executive director of the C40 Cities group of mayors taking action on climate change, warned the latest report was likely to ‚Äúpaint a grim vision‚Äù for big cities from London to Lima. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúCity residents are already on the front line of a worsening vulnerability to climate impacts such as deadly flooding, sea-level rise, wild fires, extreme storms and unbearable urban heat. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúIt is clear we are now in the climate crisis, not waiting for it. We can still overcome climate breakdown and build a thriving future, but urban adaptation efforts must outpace this new climate reality.‚Äù </p>
<p> He said national leaders must work with mayors to invest in cities‚Äô defences and richer countries must deliver on finance commitments to poorer nations to ensure no city is left behind. </p>
<p> High-pressure system to dominate from Tuesday </p>
<p> On Sunday, an area of low pressure passing to the northwest of the UK, moving towards Iceland, is expected to bring further strong winds and rain to the northwest of the country. </p>
<p> After a spell of rain for all on Monday, it looks like a high-pressure system will settle across the UK and dominate our weather from Tuesday. </p>
<p> This means it will be less windy and less changeable, although, clear skies at night could potentially give us some frosty starts. </p>

<p> New UN report set to paint stark picture of climate change impact </p>
<p> A new UN science report is set to send what may be the starkest warning yet about the impacts of climate change on people and the planet. </p>
<p> The assessment is the second in a series of three reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the latest review of climate science, which takes place every six or seven years for governments. </p>
<p> It is being published on Monday, a little over 100 days after the Cop26 summit agreed to increase action to try and limit global warming to 1.5C (2.7F) to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. </p>
<p> The outcomes of the UN talks in Glasgow were described as keeping the temperature goal alive, but only with a weak pulse, by conference president Alok Sharma. </p>
<p> The first in the series of reports was described as a ‚Äúcode red for humanity‚Äù by UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres when it was released last summer before Cop26 setting out the unequivocal and unprecedented impact humans were having on the planet. </p>
<p> The latest assessment, which looks at the impacts of climate change, efforts to adapt to rising temperatures and vulnerabilities is expected to be even more worrying. </p>
<p> A draft leaked last year warned of the risk of crossing dangerous thresholds or ‚Äútipping points‚Äù, where things such as melting of ice sheets or permafrost, or rainforests becoming grassland, become irreversible, with huge consequences. </p>
<p> Weather outlook for Tuesday to Thursday </p>
<p> Mostly dry with sunny spells on Tuesday, but cloudier with some rain in the south, this extending north during Wednesday, with rain at times through Thursday. </p>
<p> A ‚Äòwintry blast‚Äô set to come </p>
<p> A ‚ÄòWINTRY blast‚Äô is coming from Iceland to the UK this weekend with chilly -8C winds and more rain. </p>
<p> Brits should be a ready for a ‚Äòweather lottery‚Äô start to the weekend as some areas woke up to freezing conditions and high winds, while others will enjoy a brighter, milder day. </p>

<p> Meteogroup forecast for Monday </p>
<p> Monday will start overcast for most, as a band of rain, heavy at times, will affect most in the morning, apart from parts of eastern England. </p>
<p> Through the afternoon, the band of rain will slowly move eastwards, clearing Northern Ireland. </p>
<p> The heaviest rain will be over Wales and northern England. Moderate winds. </p>
<p> UK weather outlook for Tuesday and Wednesday </p>
<p> Tuesday will be mostly bright, with some morning rain for south-eastern parts but a dry start in other areas. In the afternoon, rain will continue in the south and it will stay dry and bright in other areas. </p>
<p> Wednesday will be dry and bright for northern England and Scotland, with rain in other areas </p>
<p> Monday‚Äôs weather forecast </p>
<p> An overcast start for most, as a band of rain, heavy at times, will affect most in the morning, apart from parts of eastern England. </p>
<p> Through the afternoon, the band of rain will slowly move eastwards, clearing Northern Ireland, with the heaviest rain over Wales and northern England. Moderate winds. </p>
<p> What is a snow squall? </p>
<p> According to the US National Weather Service (NWS), a snow squall is a short but very aggressive period of heavy snow. </p>
<p> It starts with towering clouds developing, which are followed by moisture released in the form of snow. </p>
<p> Snow squalls tend to be accompanied by strong winds and usually last no longer than an hour. </p>
<p> These wintertime showers form when the air near the ground is much warmer than the air above. </p>
<p> The extreme conditions also usually occur during the day and you can see snow build on the ground really quickly. </p>
<p> It was only in 2018 that the term became official and warnings were attached but a snow squall can also be referred to as a whiteout. </p>
<p> In December 2019 a snow squall ravaged through Manhattan and Central Park, which picked up 0.4 inches of snow in just 40 minutes. </p>
<p> Odds slashed on coldest March on record </p>
<p> Bookmaker Coral has slashed the odds on next month being the UK‚Äôs coldest ever March to just 2-1 (from 5-1), as forecasters continue to warn of freezing conditions. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúTemperatures are not going to soar anytime soon, despite spring being just around the corner, and we have now slashed the odds on next month going into the record books as the coldest March we have ever endured,‚Äù said Coral‚Äôs Harry Aitkenhead. </p>
<p> Four million households can claim ¬£25 a week energy bill help </p>
<p> AROUND 4million households are eligible for a ¬£25 cold weather payment when temperatures drop below zero. </p>
<p> The benefit is to help struggling Brits pay for energy bills during spells of freezing weather. </p>
<p> The latest government figures show that 3.9million Brits are eligible to receive the ¬£25 grant as energy bills rocket. </p>
<p> However, they‚Äôll only get it when the temperature falls below zero for seven days in a row. </p>
<p> There have been six triggers in Britain since November last year. </p>
<p> All of the payments have been in Scotland so far, with 394,000 eligible recipients. </p>
<p> The data shows that five of those were in December 2021, with another payment made in January. </p>
<p> You can check whether you‚Äôre owed a payment by searching for your postcode on the Department for Work and Pensions website. </p>
<p> Weather outlook for Sunday to Tuesday </p>
<p> Mainly fine Sunday, but a little rain far west, becoming windy in the northwest overnight. </p>
<p> Spell of rain Monday, then blustery showers following in the northwest; becoming fine again elsewhere. </p>
<p> Driving safely on ice: what do you do if your car is sliding? </p>
<p> If your front wheels begin to slide, take your foot off the accelerator and allow the vehicle to slow. </p>
<p> If you still do not have control of your vehicle after a few seconds, lightly press the brake. </p>
<p> However, if your back wheels are the ones causing the sliding, gently turn your wheel in the direction you are sliding while taking your foot off the accelerator, but do not brake. </p>
<p> Generally, the key for not sliding is gradually slowing down. </p>

<p> Peterborough Cathedral is seen in front of wind turbines and brickyard chimneys on a lovely start to the day just after sunrise in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. </p>
<p> We‚Äôre beginning to see signs of a change now, with a rise in pressure making it more spring-like over the past few days, especially across England and Wales. </p>
<p> However, netweather has warned that this is unlikely to last. </p>
<p> The new working week begins dry and bright towards East Anglia and the South East, but most of England and Wales see some rain or at least a shower before the day is out, as a front works its way steadily from the North West. </p>
<p> Met Office issues 12 flood alerts ahead of torrential rain </p>
<p> The Met Office has issued twelve flood alerts and warnings ahead of the torrential rain in the South West and parts of the north this evening. </p>
<p> The North Sea near Bridlington and the South West near to the River Severn have flood warnings in place, while other areas are being hit with a flood alert. </p>

<p> Weather 'chopping & changing' </p>
<p> The Met Office said the unsettled blustery weather will stay around over the coming days, especially in the north west, although conditions are not expected to be as severe as during the past week. </p>
<p> A number of weather fronts are set to cross the North, and bring bouts of wet and windy weather - while southern and eastern areas are in line for the best of the fine weather over the weekend. </p>
<p> It described the jet stream, which has been driving storm systems across the North Atlantic Ocean in recent weeks, as still being very active but these winds are shifting further north and may allow for more settled weather to arrive next week. </p>
<p> Meteorologist Alex Deakin said the weather will "remain pretty lively over the next certainly four or five days, chopping and changing day-on-day". </p>
<p> Take extra care today </p>
<p> The Met Office has urged people to take extra care when driving or walking, and warned of possible longer journey times on roads and railways due to the overnight frost. </p>
<p> More snowfall is expected to hit hilltops in some parts, while gusty winds mean blizzards are possible on higher routes. </p>
<p> Saturday is expected to be breezy, while people in the northwest have been told to brace for further strong winds and heavy rain on Sunday. </p>
<p> After a spell of rain across the UK on Monday, calmer weather is forecast from Tuesday, though clear skies could bring frosty mornings, the Met Office said. </p>
<p> Spring's here? </p>
<p> WARMER weather is expected this weekend as the Met Office lifts snow and ice warnings. </p>
<p> The south is set for a warmer weekend with sunshine and temperatures of around 50F, as Met Office lifts its snow and ice warnings. </p>
<p> Cloudy and patchy light rain is expected to continue through Saturday and Sunday. Then from Monday, most of Wales and swathes of England will be lashed by heavy rainfall. </p>
<p> 1.4 million households were left without power </p>
<p> Storms Dudley, Eunice and Franklin left 1.4 million households without power, some for up to 72 hours, and dozens of properties near the River Severn were evacuated. </p>
<p> One severe flood warning, meaning there is a danger to life, has been issued for the River Severn at Wribbenhall, Bewdley, where levels could overtop the defences, the agency said. </p>
<p> Around 400 properties have flooded across different parts of the country as a result of the heavy rain. </p>
<p> Environment Secretary George Eustice said 40,000 homes had been protected by flood defences, as he was quizzed on flooding and the lack of permanent defences on the River Severn at the National Farmers‚Äô Union conference. </p>
<p> Driving in sun glare during the winter </p>
<p> Here are our tips so you can drive safely in the Winter sun. </p>
<p> If you‚Äôre not properly prepared, it can cause serious accidents, and if the sun is in your eyes, you may not see pedestrians, cyclists or fast breaking traffic. </p>
<p> To improve vision and reduce the risk of accidents when there is sun glare: </p>
<p> Keep a pair of sunglasses in the car, preferably polarising ones </p>
<p> Use the sun visors to provide better contrast for your eyes </p>
<p> Clean your windscreen thoroughly, both inside and out </p>
<p> Check and replace your windscreen wiper blades if they‚Äôre worn, damaged, or more than a couple of years old </p>
<p> Slow down if you‚Äôre dazzled </p>
<p> If the sun‚Äôs in your eyes it‚Äôs likely to be blinding drivers behind you too, which means you need bigger gaps to allow for delayed braking reactions </p>
<p> Demisting your windscreen properly </p>
<p> Start the heater off cold and then slowly increase the temperature, this will stop the car becoming full of hot ‚Äúwet‚Äù air. </p>
<p> Make use of the air-con if you have the feature as this will prevent condensation. </p>
<p> Similarly with a clever climate control system, these features will automatically adjust to achieve the best results. </p>
<p> If you do not have air-con or climate control leave your windows slightly open to clear the windscreen faster. </p>
<p> Driving safely on ice: what do you do if your car is sliding? </p>
<p> If your front wheels begin to slide, take your foot off the accelerator and allow the vehicle to slow. </p>
<p> If you still do not have control of your vehicle after a few seconds, lightly press the brake. </p>
<p> However, if your back wheels are the ones causing the sliding, gently turn your wheel in the direction you are sliding while taking your foot off the accelerator, but do not brake. </p>
<p> Generally, the key for not sliding is gradually slowing down. </p>
<p> SUBZERO ‚Äòpolar airstream‚Äô to blast Britain </p>
<p> Following the Met Office issuing a yellow weather warning for snow and ice, a subzero ‚Äúpolar airstream‚Äù is set to blast Britain. </p>
<p> According to Netweather forecaster Nick Finnis, the ‚Äúcold and showery‚Äù airstream will bring with it ‚Äúsignificant accumulations‚Äù of snow, strong wind, hail and thunder. </p>
<p> Mr Finnis said the snow could settle ‚Äúeven at lower levels‚Äù. </p>
<p> He said: ‚ÄúA cold and showery polar airstream has moved in from the west across many areas overnight behind a cold front clearing SE England at breakfast time. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúFrequent snow showers are piling in across Scotland, N. Ireland and northern England‚Ä¶settling even at lower levels.‚Äù </p>
<p> Warning of snow & ice </p>
<p> THE MET Office has warned of snow and ice warnings, as temperatures could drop as low as -8C for parts of the country today. </p>
<p> Brits have told to take care when driving ‚Äúdifficult conditions‚Äù as forecasters warn that ‚Äúchopping and changing‚Äù weather is set to stick around for up to five days. </p>
<p> Yellow weather warnings are in place for Northern Ireland, Scotland and north-west England until around 9.30am on Friday, with icy stretches likely to form on untreated roads. </p>
<p> Maps from WXCharts show that temperatures could dip to as low as -8C in western Scotland and be bitterly cold around the country with the mercury close or below zero. </p>
<p> UK weather outlook for Sunday and Monday </p>
<p> On Sunday outbreaks of rain will spread eastwards across Scotland. Mainly dry further south with variable cloud and a chance of showers. </p>
<p> It will be an unsettled day on Monday as a band of thick cloud and rain will track south-eastwards across the country and will be locally heavy and persistent. </p>
<p> Today's forecast </p>
<p> Much of southern and central England and Wales will be dry during the day with spells of sunshine however there will be variable cloud cover in the west. </p>
<p> Scotland, Northern Ireland and northern England will be mainly cloudy with a chance of showers or some spots of light rain and drizzle expected. </p>
<p> Weather from across the Atlantic </p>
<p> Meteorologists have said the adverse weather is due to a strong jet stream driving weather systems across the Atlantic. </p>
<p> Met Office chief meteorologist, Andy Page, said: ‚ÄúAs Storm Franklin clears the UK and pushes into the near continent this afternoon the windy conditions will gradually ease and showers become fewer, leaving some dry, sunny weather for many. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúHowever, a band of rain and strong winds will reach the northwest overnight and this weather front moves south and east through Tuesday, petering out as it does so. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúThursday is potentially the coldest day of the week with a frost to start for some. Gusty winds and heavy rain continue to move south and east across the country, clearing the Southeast of England by lunchtime. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúWintry showers are expected mainly over the hills in the north again, but there could be some snow to low levels at times.‚Äù </p>
<p> The O2 ‚Äòcould be closed for MONTHS‚Äô </p>
<p> THE O2 could be closed for months as gigs at the venue are postponed after Storm Eunice ripped its domed roof to shreds. </p>
<p> Employees now say the venue, which houses dozens of bars and restaurants, a shopping centre and a massive live music venue, could be closed for months while repairs are made. </p>
<p> One told the Mirror the roof over the shops ‚Äúwas whipped off‚Äù with a ‚Äúhuge whooshing sound‚Äù. </p>
<p> Another said they understood at least part of the building will be shut for weeks to come. </p>
<p> RAC: Lives were saved by drivers staying home during Eunice </p>
<p> Millions of drivers heeded warnings to stay off the roads when Storm Eunice hit, new figures show. </p>
<p> The RAC said ‚Äúlives were saved‚Äù as the Department for Transport revealed that car traffic in Britain fell to 69% of pre-coronavirus pandemic levels on Friday February 18, down from 91% during the previous day. </p>
<p> Strong winds caused by Storm Eunice caused dangerous conditions on the roads, with three people killed in incidents involving fallen trees and other debris. </p>
<p> Several major road bridges were closed, including both crossings over the River Severn between England and Wales, and the Queen Elizabeth II bridge, which is part of the Dartford Crossing linking Essex and Kent. </p>
<p> RAC spokesman Simon Williams believes the reduction in traffic limited the number of fatalities. </p>
<p> He said: ‚ÄúThese statistics show that lives were saved as millions of motorists heeded the warnings to only drive if absolutely essential. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúIt seems like all the developments around working from home in the pandemic made a massive difference in an extreme weather event like Storm Eunice as many employees clearly were able to stay off the road and continue being productive away from their workplaces.‚Äù </p>
<p> Tips to avoid freezing and bursting pipes </p>
<p> Make sure you know where your stop tap is and check it‚Äôs working </p>
<p> If you are leaving your house during the freezing temperatures, leave your heating on and set the thermostat to 14 C </p>
<p> Make sure all roof and vulnerable pipes are insulated and your boiler is serviced </p>
<p> Make sure you have the name and telephone number of your nearest WaterSafe qualified plumber to hand. Keep it by the boiler or stop tap </p>
<p> Get a neighbour to look in occasionally if you go away </p>
<p> Massive sinkhole forces locals to flee their homes </p>
<p> A MASSIVE sinkhole forced locals to flee their homes after swallowing up a garden as the terrifying Storm Eunice battered Britain. </p>
<p> The garden in Keighley, West Yorkshire was obliterated by the treacherous weather, as flood warnings were put in place across the country. </p>
<p> Horrifying footage shows the huge hole which suddenly appeared outside the home on Sunday, consuming the entire contents of the outdoor area. </p>
<p> Four million households can claim ¬£25 a week energy bill help </p>
<p> AROUND 4million households are eligible for a ¬£25 cold weather payment when temperatures drop below zero. </p>
<p> The benefit is to help struggling Brits pay for energy bills during spells of freezing weather. </p>
<p> The latest government figures show that 3.9million Brits are eligible to receive the ¬£25 grant as energy bills rocket. </p>
<p> However, they‚Äôll only get it when the temperature falls below zero for seven days in a row. </p>
<p> There have been six triggers in Britain since November last year. </p>
<p> All of the payments have been in Scotland so far, with 394,000 eligible recipients. </p>
<p> The data shows that five of those were in December 2021, with another payment made in January. </p>
<p> You can check whether you‚Äôre owed a payment by searching for your postcode on the Department for Work and Pensions website. </p>
<p> Environment Secretary quizzed over flooding </p>
<p> Environment Secretary George Eustice said 40,000 homes had been protected by flood defences, as he was quizzed on flooding and the lack of permanent defences on the River Severn at the National Farmers‚Äô Union conference. </p>
<p> He said: ‚ÄúThe Severn has had some issues particularly around Bewdley and Ironbridge and also some issues as well around Shrewsbury, but actually the defences that we have put in place have been very successful, as they were two years ago, protecting those communities. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúWe know there are around 40,000 homes that have been protected by the flood defences put in place and on the Severn in particular we have these rather innovative demountable barriers that enable you to use the river normally most of the year. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúAnd then when the flood risk arises, we put up temporary barriers alongside the river, and those have been remarkably successful at reducing the flood risk particularly along the Severn, and have been again this time.‚Äù </p>

<p> Weather outlook for Sunday to Tuesday </p>
<p> Mainly fine Sunday, but a little rain far west, becoming windy in the northwest overnight. </p>
<p> Spell of rain Monday, then blustery showers following in the northwest; becoming fine again elsewhere. </p>
<p> Short weather summary for Saturday </p>
<p> The Met Office said: "Northern UK rather cloudy with patchy rain or drizzle; some breaks in lee shelter. </p>
<p> "Elsewhere drizzle clearing Cumbria then largely sunny. </p>
<p> "Windy in west and north, gales across northwest Scotland." </p>

<p> Heavy downpours and gusts are expected to hit the west of the UK in the coming days, with night time temperatures set to plummet below freezing for some parts of the country. The north west of the country will be hit the hardest, with the Scottish Highlands expected to see some snowfall overnight on Wednesday into Thursday after it was battered by gale force winds up to 70mph this morning. </p>
<p> Related articles </p>
<p> Snowfall could reach up to 5cm in Scotland by Thursday while the Republic of Ireland could also see some snow covering as temperatures drop. </p>
<p> The west of the UK and the north west of England are also expected to feel a chill in the coming days as stormy conditions close in towards the end of the week. </p>
<p> Parts of the Republic of Ireland and areas in north west Scotland may be hit by heavy rain from Wednesday into Thursday, while rain is also forecasted in areas of England's south west coast on Friday into Saturday. </p>
<p> Weather forecasters have predicted conditions will worsen as the weekend nears, with a brutal pressure collision bringing wet and stormy weather to west of the UK while the east of England enjoys calmer and warmer weather. </p>
<p> Brian Glaze from the weather outlook told Express.co.uk: "The weather is looking mixed through the coming days. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúWith the UK sandwiched between high pressure to the east and areas of low pressure to the west there is uncertainty in the forecast. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúThis weekend wet and very windy conditions will probably push into the west of the UK. Generally the wettest conditions will be in the west and in the east it could feel quite spring like at times in the next week." </p>
<p> Stormy conditions are expected to close in on the UK bringing more wet and windy weather. (Image: GETTY‚Ä¢MAGICSEAWEED) </p>
<p> Britons are set to be hit with yet more rain in the coming week. (Image: GETTY) </p>
<p> BBC weather forecaster Carol Kirkwood noted on Wednesday that gusty winds will last throughout the rest of the week in the west where heavy rain will also close in on areas. </p>
<p> She noted that ‚Äúheavy and persistent rain‚Äù would pour down across Scotland and Northern Ireland while a ‚Äúcold undercurrent‚Äù coming in across the North West would see temperatures drop. </p>
<p> The BBC warned that showers, hail and thunderstorms could be seen in parts of the north and north west on Thursday night. </p>
<p> Forecasters have warned that the stormy weather gripping the west on Wednesday into Thursday will taper off briefly before another storm approaches on Friday, bringing rain and showers from the west. </p>
<p> Alyssa Smithmyer, a meteorologist from AccuWeather, told Express.co.uk: ‚ÄúToday, a frontal boundary is lingering across the central UK and bringing outbreaks of rain to the western and central regions. Across Northern Ireland and western Scotland today, blustery winds will gradually taper off as the front shifts eastward. </p>
<p> The BBC warned that more wet weather would close in on Friday. (Image: BBC Weather) </p>
<p> Snow is forecast for parts of Scotland and Ireland. (Image: WXCharts) </p>
<p> ‚ÄúOn Thursday, a few showers will persist across the west and central areas but be much lighter in nature than on Wednesday. By Friday, another frontal boundary will arrive across the UK and bring another round of rain and showers. The rain will spread from west to east and arrive along the eastern coastlines later in the day.‚Äù </p>
<p> Meanwhile, the east and south of the country will enjoy sunny periods and warmer temperatures than parts of the west as areas get a long-awaited taste of springtime. </p>
<p> Areas of the south and east could see highs of up to 15 degrees on Thursday with warmer conditions than usual before the stormy conditions close in this weekend. </p>
<p> Jim Dale, senior meteorologist at British Weather Services told Express.co.uk: ‚ÄúWe are in a kind of yo-yo period now, a transition between winter and spring, when it‚Äôs not unusual to see a changeable, mixed type of weather. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúSo you can get a good day like it was in most places yesterday and then it turns and you get a wet day and wind involved, like some winds in Northwest Scotland today, for example.‚Äù </p>
<p> Although milder temperatures are expected into next week, Mr Dale warned that the unpredictable time of the year meant that weather could change rapidly and plunge Britain back into winter. </p>
<p> There are concerns more storms could batter the UK as it recovers from three in February. (Image: GETTY) </p>
<p> He said: ‚ÄúAt this time of year you can go in any direction very quickly, depending on the synoptics, the wind direction, the air stream involved. So it doesn't take much to tip us over one edge or the other and that's about where we are at the moment.‚Äù </p>
<p> Mr Dale said it was possible that the UK could be hit by yet more dramatic weather as the country still reels from being battered by three consecutive storms last month. </p>
<p> Storm Dudley, Storm Eunice, and Storm Franklin caused mass disruption across the UK, prompting the Met Office to issue multiple red alerts warning of a potential ‚Äúdanger to life‚Äù. </p>
<p> The Met Office issued four flood alerts on Tuesday for Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Devon and other areas as the country still struggles to recover from the damage caused by the storms. </p>
<p> Mr Dale said: ‚ÄúDon't think for one second that we can't get winter back in through the north because it can happen - even up to early April time there's every chance that you can get a wintry blast, which occasionally does happen.‚Äù </p>
<p> He added: ‚ÄúNormally this time of year the turbulence usually ramps up. We've just had some of that, so we probably had our fill for a little while. That isn't to say that we can't get another storm. That can happen, there's no doubt about that.‚Äù </p>

<p> HONOLULU (HawaiiNewsNow) - Light to moderate trades will prevail with localized leeward sea breezes and land breezes during the next couple. Showers will favor windward and mauka areas through mid week, with scattered leeward and interior shower development expected each afternoon and early evening. Trade winds will strengthen Wednesday night, bringing a return of more typical trade wind weather with windward showers and the occasional leeward spillover. Moderate to breezy trades will hold in place Thursday through early next week, with potentially windy conditions over the weekend. </p>

<p> Weather Alert: Fire danger, rain, thunderstorms, strong winds, and snow! </p>
<p> Lots of active weather coming to southern Colorado today and tonight from fire danger to thunderstorms and yes, even snow overnight. </p>
<p> Today‚Äôs Forecast: Almost every type of weather is coming to southern Colorado today with a mix of fire danger, strong winds, rain, thunderstorms, and yes, even snow! </p>
<p> We start the day with scattered snow showers over the mountains and rain showers up near Denver. Rain will hang out in Denver through the morning but areas south of the Palmer Divide should mostly stay dry. </p>
<p> Rain and thunderstorms will drop in from the north this afternoon with most of the lightning and thunder happening east of I-25 where there is more storm energy. </p>
<p> Snow will start falling after 7 pm tonight at the high elevation areas, falling down to 7,000 feet through the evening with pockets of heavy snow overnight. Monument Hill is an area where overnight travel could be treacherous due to 40 to 50 mph wind gusts and bursts of heavy snow. </p>
<p> Snow is tricky tonight! We're coming off a warm day & strong winds overnight might rip apart some of the snowflakes with downslope drying effects. The best accumulations will happen over 7,000 feet and into the Wet Mountain Valley. Monument Hill is the wild card tonight #cowx pic.twitter.com/cyVKkJV658 </p>
<p> Snow showers will move south overnight, meaning as snow stops falling up in the Pikes Peak Region by midnight, it could still be falling south near Walsenburg and Trinidad. </p>
<p> Colorado Springs forecast: High: 61; Low: 30. Active weather day in Colorado Springs with windy and rainy conditions through the afternoon with rain changing to snow overnight. Rain and thunderstorms in the afternoon won't be severe, but there could still be areas of heavy rain through the end of the day. Rain will change to snow overnight but accumulations will be anywhere from 0 to half an inch over most of Colorado Springs. Wind gusts tonight could range from 40 to 50 mph, so visibility from active snow could be an issue for late-night drivers. </p>
<p> Pueblo forecast: High: 69; Low: 33. Warm and dry across Pueblo in the early afternoon but rain and thunderstorms will move in through the end of the day. We won't see any severe weather today but there could be pockets of heavy rain through the evening. Rain will try and change to snow overnight as temperatures drop, but even if we do see snow over Pueblo, we won't see any accumulation. Wind gusts tonight could be in the 40 to 50 mph range. </p>
<p> Canon City forecast: High: 67; Low: 34. Rain showers with thunder and lightning are possible late today with rain changing to snow overnight. We shouldn't see any accumulation in Canon City tonight but south into the Wet Mountains, we could get several inches. Wind gusts tonight will be in the 20 to 30 mph range. </p>
<p> Woodland Park forecast: High: 50; Low: 20. Rain will move back into Woodland Park this afternoon with a quick change to snow this evening as temperatures fall below 40 degrees. Snow could be heavy at times with accumulations of 2 to 5 inches, mainly in the grass, through tomorrow morning. It'll be windy tonight with gusts in the 20 to 30 mph range, which could really low visibility for late-night drivers. </p>
<p> Tri-Lakes forecast: High: 40s; Low: 20s. Rain and thunderstorms are possible this afternoon with rain changing to snow after 7 pm tonight. The Tri-Lakes are and Monument Hill have the highest uncertainty for snow forecasting tonight, as the weather models are really split on how much snow could fall. Snow totals in Monument, Black Forest, and Palmer Lake will likely be anywhere from 1 to 4 inches through tomorrow morning, but 40 to 50 mph wind gusts could create hazardous travel conditions for overnight drivers. </p>
<p> Plains forecast: High: 60s & 70s; Low: 30s. Warm and windy with high fire danger across the plains with Baca County under a Red Flag Warning through the afternoon. Cool air will move across Highway 50 later in the afternoon with rain to follow from the end of the day into the overnight hours. We shouldn't get any snow to fall across the plains but we'll see widespread wind gusts in the 30 to 50 mph range. </p>
<p> Walsenburg and Trinidad forecast: High: 60s; Low: 30s. We're going to see really windy conditions today along the southern I-25 corridor from Walsenburg to Trinidad and especially west up into the mountains and the Wet Mountain Valley. Rain will move into the region late today and tonight with rain changing to snow after 10 pm tonight. Snow totals will be pretty low along I-25, generally less than 2 inches for most locations, but 40 mph wind gusts could make overnight driving conditions very dangerous due to low visibility. </p>
<p> Mountains forecast: High: 50s; Low: 20s. Scattered rain and snow showers will fall over the mountains from the morning through the overnight hours. We'll see snow fall down to most towns this evening with 1 to 4 inches up around Woodland Park, 1 to 3 inches in Rye, 3 to 6 inches in San Isabel, and 3 to 6 inches down near La Veta through early tomorrow morning. </p>
<p> Extended outlook forecast: Wednesday morning will be very windy with snow showers leaving the state to the south. We'll be much drier along and east of I-25 tomorrow with just a few scattered rain or snowflakes through the afternoon. </p>
<p> Thursday will be warmer and dry with a chance for scattered showers on Friday. ____ </p>

<p> PHILADELPHIA - Temperatures are crashing on Monday compared to the warmer weekend weather we experienced. Highs will peak in the upper 30s and it will still be quite a windy day. </p>
<p> Beginning Monday morning, wind chills will be in the 20s. A bonus point for Monday is that the skies will be sunny as well. </p>
<p> The monthly average temperature for February was 39.8 degrees, which is approximately 4.2 degrees above normal, meaning it was a warmer than average month so far. </p>
<p> There isn't any precipitation anticipated for Monday as well. </p>
<p> The sunny skies continue Tuesday, but we lose the wind. The Philadelphia region will also lose the chill. </p>
<p> Highs jump up to the upper 40s, which is the average high for the time of year. Highs will stay near 50 for the rest of the workweek. </p>
<p> The weather is pretty quiet this week. We're just tracking a few sprinkles Wednesday and Thursday afternoon. </p>

<p> South Korea has the 4 seasons, and I like fall the most. I have the alergic to the flowers and plants, so my allergic coryza always become worse and worse. Summer is hot, and I feel bad and annoying when it becomes a monsoon, especially like these days. In here, it was rainy all day even today. Cloudy, rainy, hot, and even damp. Winter is too cold, too. But in Fall, the autumn breeze and some beautiful red and yellow leaves make me feel hopeful. I think this is intended that I'm a boy, but autumn is the best season to read books and novels. I can concentrate in one thing in fall, and the cool wind is very pleased. I love fall, and I want the fall to come more faster. I wish September comes more earlier and faster. I hate summer the most, and this is summer!!!!!! </p>

<p> Weather Forecast: Cold and windy to start the week </p>
<p> MISSOULA ‚Äî The arctic front has made its way through all of western Montana, cold air is now firmly in place and will continue through the rest of the week. </p>
<p> Snow showers will continue for west-central and southwest Montana Monday morning. Combine the snow with gusty winds and a difficult commute to work can be expected this morning with snow and blowing snow. Snow has tapered off in the Flathead Valley and along the continental divide in the Glacier region, however, strong gusty northeast winds will continue to bring blowing snow and low visibilities through the morning hours. </p>
<p> EXTENDED COVERAGE: Winter weather returns! </p>
<p> A secondary push of very cold air will move into all of western Montana this afternoon and continue into Tuesday. This deep arctic air will continue to bring strong gusty northeast winds across the entire Northern Rockies. Extremely cold air with these winds will result in a lengthy period of very low wind chills of 15 to 30 degrees below zero. Even more dangerous wind chill readings of 30 to 40 degrees below zero are likely along the continental divide which includes the Glacier NP region, the Seeley/Swan valley, and the Butte/Blackfoot Region. These extremely cold wind chills will start this evening and continue into Wednesday. </p>
<p> Winter returns to Missoula! </p>
<p> Here is a look at potential wind chill tonight into Tuesday morning: </p>
<p> Missoula: -22 to -28 Kalispell: -25 to -30 Butte: -30 to -35 West Glacier: -34 to -39 Seeley Lake: -35 to -40 </p>
<p> The coldest morning of the week will be Wednesday morning with actual temperatures (not including wind chill) being 10 to 15 degrees below zero across western Montana. Even colder air is expected along the divide with temperatures around 15 to 25 degrees below zero. </p>

<p> How's the Weather Out There? Forecasting the Chaos of Weather </p>
<p> ByTim BrookesRepublished from the pages of National Geographic magazine </p>
<p> ‚Ä¢ 25 min read </p>
<p> ShareTweetEmail </p>
<p> One Saturday afternoon last summer, Carrie and Jason Guyette were married on an island on the Vermont side of Lake Champlain. The forecast had been good‚Äîpartly cloudy, a west wind of 5 to 10 miles (8 to 16 kilometers) per hour‚Äîbut the weather was even better. The sky was cloudless, the light falling across the lake in rays of silver and blue. "It was the perfect day for a wedding," recalls Suzanne LaBombard, the mother of the bride. </p>
<p> After the newlyweds kissed, the weather began to change. "The wind shifted round to the north and began to pick up," says Jason, "but it wasn't really anything to worry about." The bride and groom climbed into an open carriage for a tour of the island, but after a while the wind was strong enough for the bride to start worrying about her veil, and the driver about her horses. They turned back. "I could see the distinct edge of the front‚Äîit looked about two miles south," says Jason. </p>
<p> They returned to the tent, where most of the 200 guests had gathered for the reception. The flaps were whipping, and one or two small pegs were uprooted, but even so, there seemed no reason to worry. The tent, 60 feet by 120 feet (18 meters by 36 meters) in size, was anchored by stakes driven 4 feet (1.2 meters) into the ground. "This thing's not going anywhere," the DJ told Jason. </p>
<p> The groom turned, took four paces, and heard a ferocious whoosh behind him. A single devastating gust ripped the tent out of the ground and lifted it over his head. Six-foot stakes flew through the air like javelins. China and glass shattered. A 30-foot (9-meter) main pole swept across the lawn as the family and guests ducked or flung themselves to the ground. </p>
<p> The gust, which lasted just seconds, had the freakish capriciousness of a tornado. It slammed the tent back down so hard that stakes were driven into the earth again. "It was so fast it was uncanny," Jason says. Seven people were hurt by flying stakes and glass. The groom's step-grandmother was rushed to a hospital in Burlington, where she died of her injuries. </p>
<p> Weather moves on a grand scale, in fronts and storms that can span half a continent. But it is also intensely personal and extremely local. The brilliant weather at the wedding, the terrifying storm at the reception‚Äîthis is weather on the scale that matters to us. So we demand of meteorologists the near impossible: Understand the drama of the entire planet's atmosphere, and tell us what to expect here. Today. At 4:30 p.m. </p>
<p> Thanks mainly to keener instruments and more powerful computers, forecasters are extending their reach into the uncertain future. These days a forecast of the daily high temperature five days in advance is likely to be about five degrees (2.8 degrees Celsius) off in the United States, two degrees better than in 1975. Flash flood warnings have improved from 7 minutes in 1987 to 47 minutes in 2004. Had 2005's barrage of hurricanes along the Gulf Coast and Florida struck 30 years ago, landfall predictions three days ahead could have been off by as much as 475 miles (764 kilometers). By last year the average error had been cut by nearly 300 miles (483 kilometers), allowing more selective evacuations. </p>
<p> Yet because the tiniest changes in the atmosphere can produce radical changes in weather, the perfect forecast is tantalizingly elusive. We may never be able to anticipate a hurricane's every move. And the smallest, fastest changing weather events, like that wedding-day storm, may always be capable of blindsiding us. </p>
<p> "Forecasting is still an inexact science," says Charles McGill, who works in the Burlington office of NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS). A day before the wedding, the office had predicted storms for late in the evening, but not for that afternoon. "Maybe someday the forecast models will be good enough to pinpoint when and where individual thunderstorms will occur, but I think that day is a long way away." </p>
<p> All it takes to create weather is air and solar heating. Then things get complicated. Some of the sun's energy is reflected by clouds; some heats land masses and oceans. Air warmed in the tropics becomes less dense, rises, and heads toward the Poles. Along the way it cools, its freight of moisture condensing into clouds and falling as precipitation. Earth's rotation causes the air currents to swerve right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern. Mountain ranges, ocean currents, and the high-altitude jet streams meandering around the globe at 200 miles an hour (320 kilometers an hour) or more all shape the broad circulation pattern. Add local variations in temperature, humidity, and pressure, and the result is the weather we feel on the cheek or read in the clouds. </p>
<p> Much of the physics involved has been understood for decades, even centuries. Yet those forces combine in so many ways, obeying so many variables, that weather is like a summer cumulus: Its stately progress across the sky seems entirely predictable, but each wisp and tentacle seems to have a life of its own, erratic and seemingly random. </p>
<p> Prediction efforts began where they were most needed. In 17th-century Britain, for example, Edmond Halley of comet fame mapped the trade winds and the Asian monsoon as an aid to sailors. Typhoon-prone Japan has a mountainous landscape that crowds its people and industry near the coasts, where they are vulnerable to landslides and storm surges. As a result the Japan Meteorological Agency has become a leader in forecasting typhoons in the western North Pacific and the South China Sea. </p>
<p> In North America the impetus for forecasting was savage weather, such as a storm that damaged a house of worship in Connecticut and inspired a sermon titled "God Sometimes Answers His People by Terrible Things in Righteousness: A Discourse Occasioned by that Awful ThunderClap Which Struck the Meeting-House in N. London, August 31st 1735." The United States, with its vast landmass and range of climates and terrain, suffers from hailstorms, blizzards, flash floods, and the world's highest incidence of tornadoes‚Äî492 of them in May 2004 alone. Fifty million people live in coastal counties prone to hurricanes. Accurate forecasting can mean the difference between prosperity and ruin, life and death. </p>
<p> To predict what the weather will be, you need to know what it is right now‚Äîwhat meteorologists call current conditions. This is one of meteorology's toughest tasks. At weather stations like the Mount Washington Observatory, at 6,288 feet (1,917 meters) on the highest peak in New Hampshire's White Mountains, current conditions are observed the old-fashioned way: by going out into them. </p>
<p> Guidebooks like to call Mount Washington "home of the world's worst weather," and the boast seemed plausible one winter night. The wind was peaking above 90 miles (145 kilometers) an hour‚Äîhurricane force. Chunks of rime ice were crashing against the observatory windows. Steve Bailey, one of the weather observers, suited up, hung a small flashlight around his neck, and picked up an empty precipitation can‚Äîa hip-tall metal cylinder for catching rain or, tonight, snow. </p>
<p> He was setting off to collect and replace another can that had been out in the weather for six hours, a hundred yards from the observatory on the ice-clad mountaintop. "If the winds equal your weight, they can knock you down," he said, laughing. "I'm going to run." </p>
<p> I took off after him, and‚Äîwham! The wind stopped me dead. It felt like solid air. Bailey's flashlight was a glowworm, somewhere ahead in the dark, but by now he had switched cans and was running back, hugging the other cylinder. </p>
<p> Indoors, with boots, coat, mittens, and goggles off, he picked up his slide rule. "There's a lot of talking to yourself in this job. Dew point of 23.4 converts to what in Celsius? Height of cloud above station ... 7,000 to 8,000 feet [2,134 to 2,438 meters]... air pressure ... three point one ... patchy cloud cover ... high today was 29.9 ... depth of snow on the ground ... that's a real guess." </p>
<p> After 15 minutes, Bailey was ready to send his report‚Äîthis extraordinary weather compressed into code and numbers‚Äîto the National Weather Service. He turned to the monitor and typed in a data string. </p>
<p> The modem twittered. </p>
<p> The dispatch from Mount Washington joined the blizzard of data that descends each day on the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), nine forecasting offices that come under the umbrella, so to speak, of the National Weather Service. (Europe also combines some meteorological efforts, at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts outside London, which specializes in forecasts that look ahead from two days to more than a week.) </p>
<p> Each day the NWS takes in 192,000 observations from surface stations, 2,700 observations from ships, 18,000 from weather buoys, 115,000 from aircraft, about 250,000 from balloons, and 140 million from satellites. Other data, in countless bytes, arrive from instrument networks abroad. Yet all this isn't enough. </p>
<p> The computer models that are the mainstay of current forecasting require even more data, in tidier form: readings from points on a uniform grid extending around the globe and up into the atmosphere, updated every hour or, better, every minute. That's unattainable in the real world. Satellites have trouble seeing through thick clouds and can't map winds in detail. Weather stations, balloons, aircraft, and ships aren't evenly spaced around the globe, and in many areas‚Äîvast swaths of poorer continents such as Africa‚Äîground readings are sparse. </p>
<p> To fill out those observations and create a perfect starting point, meteorologists take their best recent picture of the atmosphere and project it forward in time. The result is a "forecast" of the present, which helps fill the data gaps, completing a snapshot of the current weather at every point on the imaginary global grid. It's generated with the same computer tools that allow meteorologists to look into the future‚Äîan approach called numerical modeling. </p>
<p> The time machine is a computer model of the atmosphere, built not from air and water vapor but from data and equations. The equations describe the key processes that govern weather, such as airflow, evaporation, Earth's rotation, and the release of heat as water condenses or freezes. When meteorologists plug in data on atmospheric conditions, then run the equations, the model predicts how the atmosphere will evolve. It lets forecasters ask: If this is what the atmosphere is doing now, what will it be doing in one minute? And then again one minute after that? </p>
<p> "You keep taking these baby steps forward in time," solving and re-solving the equations, explains James Hoke, director of NCEP's Hydrometeorological Prediction Center, which does the nation's general-purpose forecasting. At each step, the model computes weather conditions at all points on that imaginary global grid. The process lets meteorologists generate a full picture of current conditions, then carry it forward in time to create a forecast. Some models push as far as 16 days into the future, though by that point the accuracy is so diluted that about all they can say is whether the temperature will be above or below the normal monthly average. </p>
<p> Even baby-stepping into the future takes bruteforce computing. "We've always known what equations we should use," says Stacy Stewart of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. But early computers couldn't run a model fast enough for useful predictions. "You'd get forecasts three days after you needed them." </p>
<p> NCEP's computer center in Gaithersburg, Maryland, now crunches numbers in one of the most powerful weather-forecasting engines in the world, a supercomputer called Blue. (A backup, housed elsewhere, is called White, and researchers refine their models on a third machine called Red.) Resembling a warehouse filled with high-tech filing cabinets, the new machine isn't running at full speed yet. But by 2009 it will handle 8.6 trillion calculations‚Äî15,000 years' work with a handheld calculator‚Äîin a second. </p>
<p> Yet even the most sophisticated computer models drastically simplify the real atmosphere. Most track conditions at points tens of miles apart, even though actual weather can vary widely within only a couple of miles‚Äîthe size of a thunderstorm. The models also have biases: Some do better with hurricanes, while others are better at predicting winter weather, such as ice storms. Forecasters try to compensate by consulting different models, like patients getting second opinions. All that means extra number crunching. </p>
<p> Something called the butterfly effect adds to the burden. In 1972 Ed Lorenz, a meteorologist at MIT, used the atmosphere to illustrate chaos theory‚Äîthe idea that tiny fluctuations can, over time, have outsize effects. He suggested that the gentlest breeze from a butterfly closing its wings on one side of the planet could cause a storm on the other. It's an exaggeration, with a measure of truth: Factors so small that they get lost‚Äîin measurement gaps or errors, or in the models' shortcuts‚Äîcan make a major difference in the weather. </p>
<p> A small wind shift, for example, might send a storm veering miles from its predicted course. In winter "a difference of a fraction of a degree can make all the difference in the world as to whether you get all rain, or all snow, or freezing rain, or sleet," Hoke says. "That small difference has a huge impact on millions of people." </p>
<p> To address the butterfly effect, forecasters rely on a strategy called ensemble forecasting. Starting with one basic set of initial conditions, they run multiple forecasts‚Äîas many as 50 at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, the world leader in ensemble forecasting. Each begins with a slightly different "perturbation"‚Äîa change in wind speed, a degree in temperature, a percentage point in humidity. The forecast becomes statistical: In, say, 43 of the 50 computer runs snow develops, while in seven it rains. That's why so many forecasts use words such as "possible" or "likely," and speak of the percentage probability of precipitation. </p>
<p> Computers don't have the last word. After the models have their say, their output is converted to user-friendly graphics and, in the U.S., sent to the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC), on the fourth floor of a nondescript building in Camp Springs, Maryland. There flesh-and-blood meteorologists second-guess the machines. </p>
<p> One fall day Bruce Terry was the lead forecaster on duty, sitting at a workstation flanked by computer screens. The windows were shaded to keep out glare, hiding the weather outside. All the action was on the screens. On one a radar readout showed a blue-green smear curving up from the southern plains states toward the Ohio Valley; another displayed a satellite view of the same region, veiled in gray cloud. On that particular day Terry's job was to decide where the rain would fall, and how much. Forecasting precipitation, he said, is one of his greatest challenges. </p>
<p> At least it wasn't summer, when thunderstorms, too small for the computer models to capture, deliver most of the rain. "You'll have an inch of rain here, but five miles [eight kilometers] down the road you get nothing," said Terry. Precipitation forecasts are easier in the cool seasons, when weather systems tend to be large and well organized, like this one. </p>
<p> He stared at the screen some more. "It's really important to be able to recognize the biases in the models," he said. Right now, comparing the rain on the screen with model forecasts, Terry sensed a bias was at work. "In the first six hours of the forecast, the models never seem to have enough precipitation." His experience told him this storm system was ripe for heavy rain. A patch of low pressure was lingering over the southern Rockies, drawing wet air from the Gulf of Mexico and supercharging the storm with moisture. </p>
<p> The computer had given him its best guess, but now it was time to follow his instincts. He frowned and used his computer drafting tool to sketch in corrected precipitation estimates, calling for heavier rain. By morning, he forecast, the core of the storm would be drenching Washington, D.C., and the leading edge would be over New England, promising snow. The next day, commuters would find he was right. </p>
<p> "You noticed Bruce was bald?" his colleague Pete Manousos joked. "He pulls his hair out when he does his forecasts." </p>
<p> In fact, what the HPC staff such as Bruce Terry produce is not, officially, a forecast, but "guidance" or "advice" for the 125 local NWS Weather Forecast Offices. It's also grist for commercial forecasters‚Äîpurveyors of weather "products" such as glossy maps and satellite images for radio, newspapers, TV, and websites. Some even sell specialized forecasts to windsurfers wondering which beach has the best conditions, or to orchid growers needing advance warning of frost. </p>
<p> Other forecasters are looking beyond weather to its ripple effects on the infrastructure, environment, and economy. Pilot projects in several states combine winter storm forecasts with data on roads and traffic to help highway departments dispatch the right number of plows and salt trucks to the right highways at the right time. And in Florida, researchers are turning weather prediction into forecasts of fire. </p>
<p> In a conference center at Florida State University, two dozen meteorologists, computer modelers, and foresters lean forward in excitement as Phil Cunningham, a meteorology professor at the university, starts a video. The screen shows a small wildfire nibbling at a Florida woodland. Low flames blacken palmetto and gallberry undergrowth, and a few trees smoke. </p>
<p> Within seconds the smoke pall starts to rotate. Suddenly the flames at the center seem to twist together, then leap upward. An astounding thing is growing, a "fire whirl" that spirals above the treetops, tight and vivid as a tornado. </p>
<p> Wildfires are a major threat to the sprawling suburbs of Florida, where land once cleared for crops now grows scrub and trees, and in the subtropical climate grows them very efficiently. "I've seen trees put on five feet [1.5 meters] in a year," says Gary Achtemeier, a Forest Service research meteorologist. A long dry spell between December and May, followed by the most intense lightning season in the mainland U.S., adds to the danger. </p>
<p> Deliberate fires, called prescribed burns, can reduce the risk, but only if the weather is right. Hot winds can send the fire spiraling out of control. Calm weather is better‚Äîexcept when a temperature inversion traps the smoke at ground level. Then it can mix with water vapor to form a lethal "superfog" that can steal along low drainages and throw a curtain across a highway. </p>
<p> "Typically these superfogs develop when there's a clear sky, light winds, and unlimited visibility. People are driving 60, 70 miles [97, 113 kilometers] an hour, and they come into one of these drainages, and"‚ÄîAchtemeier snaps his fingers‚Äî"they can't see beyond the hood of their car." </p>
<p> So Cunningham is combining weather forecasts with computer simulations of fire to predict how a prescribed burn might behave. That's not simple, because fire makes its own weather. The fire's updraft, for example, sucks in air and generates winds that fan the flames. But the researchers hope to create a tool for telling foresters where and when to burn, and how the smoke will spread. "In five to eight years," says Al Riebau, the Forest Service's national program leader for atmospheric sciences, "parents of asthmatic children may be able to check on their laptops to see if any smoke is going to be heading their way." </p>
<p> And what's the forecast for forecasting ordinary weather‚Äîthe cold fronts, drizzle, and sunshine that are the backdrop to most people's lives? Steady improvement, says Richard Anthes, president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder. By 2025, he says, "numerical predictions in the zero to two-day time frame will be essentially perfect. If the forecast says 12 inches [30 centimeters] of snow, the actual amount will be in the 10- to 14-inch [25- to 35-centimeter] range." Forecasts of temperatures and storms a week out will be as reliable as two- to three-day forecasts are today‚Äîwhich is to say, right most of the time. </p>
<p> More detailed models and faster computers will drive some progress. Computing-intensive pilot projects in some major U.S. cities, for example, are already forecasting thunderstorms up to 24 hours ahead, to within a couple of miles useful for airports, though not good enough to guarantee a storm-free picnic or wedding. But better data will be the real key, say meteorologists. </p>
<p> New generations of satellites will help fill the gaps that now hamper forecasts. Starting in December, if plans hold, a joint U.S-Taiwan system called FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC will probe the atmosphere by eavesdropping on radio signals from the global positioning system's satellite beacons. The six COSMIC satellites will pick up GPS signals that have passed into the atmosphere and back out to space. By analyzing how air temperature and moisture affect the speed of the radio waves, COSMIC will create a global map of these atmospheric properties. </p>
<p> Other satellites will sample the atmosphere with light. A technology called LIDAR (an acronym for "light detection and ranging") works like a light-based radar gun, clocking wind by sending out a laser pulse and catching its reflections from air molecules and dust particles. A satellite-borne LIDAR could track winds over the oceans, where measurements are patchy‚Äîand where hurricanes and typhoons begin their march to shore. </p>
<p> "If you can cut the uncertainty in the predicted landfall site of a hurricane to a hundred kilometers [62 miles]," says Jim Ryan, a physicist at the University of New Hampshire who is developing a LIDAR, "you can start talking about more intelligent evacuations, instead of sounding alarms over half the eastern seaboard." Next year Ryan hopes to launch a balloon-mounted LIDAR‚Äîa first step toward a satellite version. </p>
<p> Near the foot of Mount Washington one frigid New Hampshire night, as the last blush of sunset silhouetted the birches, Ryan supervised a LIDAR test. Inside the small, domed observatory an operator threw a switch, and a brilliant pale green line leaped up into the dark sky. Whenever a fleck of dust drifted into the beam, it seemed to spark. </p>
<p> Every few seconds the laser fell dark, then lit up again‚Äîthe finger of meteorology probing the heavens over and over. </p>

<p> Tonga is a beautiful area of the world, and one of the few places where people can get into the water with humpback whales. These gentle giants travel here in July from all around the world so that they can breed and bear their young in waters where there are no orcas or large sharks. Humpbacks have few predators when they are full grown, but the calves are vulnerable to these predators when they are small. Swimmers were filming this incredible animal near the island of Vava'u, enjoying a spectacular display as the humpback rolled at the surface. But a blur of motion caught the eye of the swimmer with the camera as she they finished watching the whale. Too fast to be seen clearly, the swimmer was only aware of the fact that something large and incredibly fast had passed close by. Watching the footage later and slowing it down revealed that a large sailfish had passed between the whale and the swimmer. Sailfish are the fastest swimmers in the ocean. Their top speed is the topic of debate, with some sources citing that they can reach 125km/h (68mph), while others say that 35km/h is the highest recorded speed. They use this great speed to spear and injure fish with their long and sharp bill. Impaling or slashing fish causes them to swim much slower, allowing the sailfish to capture them. This is a particularly effective means of attack when more than one sailfish attacks a school of smaller fish, such as sardines. This swimmer was not in any serious danger, but the thought of such a large fish coming past like a torpedo with a harpoon on the front was intimidating. It is rare for a swimmer to catch sight of a sailfish as they will avoid humans, and it is even more rare for a person to capture an event like this on video. </p>

<p> Weather Forecasts </p>
<p> The weather symbols and types of weather measurements described below are common parts of weather forecast maps. </p>
<p> Warm and Cold Fronts </p>
<p> On weather maps, blue lines show where cold fronts are located. The blue triangles along the line point in the direction that the front is moving. Red lines show where warm fronts are located. The red half circles along the line indicate the direct that the warm front is moving. </p>
<p> High and Low Pressure Systems </p>
<p> Air pressure affects the weather. Areas of high pressure are usually where weather is calm and sunny. Areas of low pressure can be stormy. Air pressure is indicated on weather maps with a blue "H" at each center of high pressure and a red "L" at each center of low pressure. The most detailed weather maps also include pressure measurements and contour lines that connect areas of equal pressure. </p>
<p> Cloud Cover </p>
<p> Cloud cover can be shown in weather forecasts in different ways. Often clouds are shown in a satellite image of the region. Infrared (IR) satellite images can be used to help identify whether the clouds are high or low in the troposphere. But satellites can only see the clouds from above. Clouds are identified from below at weather stations. Maps of weather station data will represent cloud cover at each station with a circle. The circle is empty if skies are clear. It's filled in with white if the sky is cloudy and half-filled if the sky is partly cloudy. Citizen scientists also make cloud observations which can help with weather forecasting and climate research. For example, citizen scientists using the GLOBE Observer Clouds app make sky observations that get added to a global database. </p>
<p> Wind and Wind Direction </p>
<p> Weather station maps indicate wind direction and speed with little arrows attached to each weather station point. The more barbs at the end of each arrow, and the longer they are, the harder the wind is blowing. Each long barb is 10 knots (about 11.5 miles per hour or 18 kilometers per hour). Each short barb is half that amount. A barb that looks like a triangle is blowing at 50 knots (about 58 mph or 80 kph). The Windy.com map (website and app) shows winds worldwide according to data from several weather models. </p>
<p> Air Temperature </p>
<p> Weather maps typically indicate temperature with colors with orange and red for the warmest temperatures and blue and purple for the coldest temperatures. In maps of weather station data, the number to the upper left of each station is the air temperature in degrees F (for U.S. maps) or degrees C (for other countries). </p>
<p> Dew Point </p>
<p> The number to the lower left of each station is the dew point temperature in degrees F (for U.S. maps) or degrees C (for other countries). The dew point is a measure of moisture; it shows how much you'd have to cool the air to get a relative humidity of 100 percent. The higher the dew point, the more water vapor there is for producing rain or snow. </p>
<p> Barometric Pressure </p>
<p> The number to the upper right of each station is the barometric pressure. Since the pressure goes down with altitude, this reading has been adjusted to show the pressure as if the station were at sea level. The typical sea-level pressure is a little bit more than 1000 millibars. (The number is in kilopascals (kPa), which is the same as millibars). </p>
<p> The number has been compressed to fit the map by lopping off the first one or two digits (which are always a "10" or a "9") and omitting the decimal point before the last digit. For example, the code "085" would mean 1008.5 millibars, while 954 would be 995.4 millibars. </p>
<p> On a map of barametric pressure, you'll find lines, called isobars that go around centers of high and low pressure. They connect places with equal barometric pressure, so you can see where the highs and lows are. The wind usually follows the isobars, with a slight trend in the direction of the low pressure area. </p>

<p> Sunny weather: sunshine hours </p>
<p> Sunshine is the most important element of a holiday for most - it's why we go away, seeking warm rays on our work weary faces. However, do you know where to go for guaranteed sunshine? </p>
<p> Sunshine hours: Where & when is it sunniest? </p>
<p> Here we talk you through our definition of sunshine hours to help you make the most of our climate guides, as well as where in the world you will find glorious sunny days with temperatures that suit you, whenever you want to travel. </p>
<p> About sunshine hours </p>
<p> Sunshine hours are the average number of hours in a day when the sun is shining brightly. This is different to daylight hours, which is the time from sunrise to sunset. Sunshine hours are the figures you really want to know about when you're hoping to book a holiday to a lovely, sunny destination. </p>
<p> We use data gathered daily over a 30-year period, which allows us to calculate an average daily figure and see patterns throughout the year. As a result, we know when there is more or less cloud, and can then determine when it is likely to be sunny and how long for. </p>
<p> We have put the emphasis on sunny holiday destinations - places people want to go sunbathing or exploring on their time off. On top of this, we're only really talking about places that are sunny and warm or hot, not sunny and cold. </p>
<p> The South Pole, for example, has 19 hours of sunshine per day from November to January but as this isn't a big holiday destination, we have left areas such as this out of our regional breakdown. </p>
<p> Where will you find the most sun? </p>
<p> Sun, sun, sun - it's what we Brits crave most, especially when it comes to holidays. To help you find your dream destinations with plenty of sunshine, we've broken the sunniest places into regions, many of which make fabulous holiday destinations at one time or another throughout the year. </p>
<p> Unsurprisingly, you'll typically find the most amount of sunshine in the summer months, be that from May to September in the northern hemisphere, or November to March in the southern hemisphere. Read on to find out more about destinations with the most sunshine hours from the list below. </p>
<p> Desert regions </p>
<p> It's crucial to point out that while the desert regions are without doubt the sunniest, most are also the hottest, and therefore not necessarily ideal holiday destinations for everyone, especially in summer. </p>
<p> Popular resorts around Egypt's Red Sea, such as Sharm el Sheikh and Marsa Alam, and Luxor and Aswan around the Nile, are the closest desert regions to the UK. </p>
<p> Here, you'll find up to 12 hours of bright sunshine per day in summer, while even in winter that figure rarely drops below eight hours of sunshine - great if you're looking to escape the winter chill at home. </p>
<p> Did you know? If you travel to these regions either side of summer, you're sure to find plenty of sunshine at a more manageable temperature </p>
<p> A hop, skip and a jump southeast takes you to the world's most glamorous destination, Dubai, which sees the most amount of sunshine in May and June with an average of 11 hours per day, while winter months hardly ever drop lower than eight hours from December to March. </p>
<p> Similarly, Las Vegas in Nevada, USA, sees an impressive 13 hours of sunshine from May to July and no less than eight hours of sunshine per day from November to January. </p>
<p> While this may sound ideal, if you want to make the most of those long, sunny days you should also consider the temperature; Las Vegas in the height of summer is one hot city that many would find pretty hot, let alone Dubai, which is near unbearable for some between June and September. </p>
<p> Mediterranean climate regions </p>
<p> Arguably the finest climate, the mediterranean regions see dry, hot, sunny summers, and mild, sunny winters - conditions synonymous with the Mediterranean. </p>
<p> These regions stretch far and wide from the Mediterranean itself to other parts of Europe, the Canary Islands, Cape Town, California, and more. </p>
<p> Did you know? Turkey & Greece have more sunshine in summer than anywhere else with a mediterranean climate </p>
<p> Out of these places, the eastern Mediterranean, Turkey and Greece in particular, see the most amount of sunshine year round with a whopping 14 hours on average at the height of summer. </p>
<p> Cyprus follows closely behind with 12 hours of sunshine each day. Even in winter, when the UK peaks with around one hour of sunshine in December, these destinations see no less than five sunshine hours each day. </p>
<p> Destinations in the western Med also bask in lots of sunshine, especially in summer. The Algarve, Malta, Malaga, and Alicante are just a few examples, while the Canary Islands really stand out owing to their location much further south. </p>
<p> The weather in the Canaries is renowned for its consistency throughout the year, with few fluctuations. With an average of 10 hours per day in summer and six in winter, it's easy to see why it's such a hit with those after reliable sunshine, year round - the peak season actually runs during the winter months, not the summer months as you might expect. </p>
<p> Did you know? You can pitch two destinations against each to compare sunshine hours throughout the year with our interactive weather tool </p>
<p> Much like the Canaries, Cape Town's mediterranean climate makes it hugely popular in winter. Given its position south of the equator, the city's summer months run from roughly the beginning of November until the end of February when Cape Town enjoys 10 to 11 hours of sunshine each day. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, Florida may well be called the Sunshine State but it's pipped to the post by California. </p>
<p> The western US state is bathed in sunshine year round, from San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco to Yosemite National Park, there's an annual average of five to nine hours per day in winter, rising to nine to 12 hours per day during summer months. </p>
<p> Tropical winter sun regions </p>
<p> There are a handful of tropical regions in the northern hemisphere which have dry winters, making them ideal for a little beach time. </p>
<p> The Caribbean is the most obvious place to start thanks to its warm, sunny weather - all within a direct eight to 10 hour flight of the UK. </p>
<p> The Caribbean is idyllic in winter, and Barbados is the sunniest island as it is a touch further south than most, while Dominican Republic follows closely behind. Both have around 3,000 hours of sunshine per year and roughly eight to nine hours per day. </p>
<p> In the Indian Ocean, the Maldives, much like the Caribbean, has some of its best weather from January to May with eight to 10 hours of sunshine a day. February and March are the sunniest months, and November the least although it still has an average of nearly seven hours a day. </p>
<p> Did you know? Both the Caribbean and the Maldives have masses of sunshine during their summer wet seasons when it's also cheaper to go </p>
<p> Over on India's west coast, Goa is another top tropical destination with lots of winter sun, and more budget friendly than many places in the Caribbean or the Maldives. </p>
<p> After the summer monsoon come the dry months from December to March, offering around 10 hours of sunshine per day. </p>
<p> Then there's Thailand, much loved by backpackers, luxury travellers and sun seeking holidaymakers alike. It's sunniest from the beginning of December to the end of March, with February seeing the most sunshine. </p>
<p> If you fancy travelling south of the equator there are a select few destinations that have equally great winter weather with loads of sunshine although you would have to visit during the northern hemisphere's summer. </p>
<p> Bali, Mauritius and countries in southern Africa provide similar sunny conditions with dry weather at the opposite time of year from those places above. </p>
<p> Bali is particularly good, with a dry sunny season that runs from June to October with generally 10 hours of sunshine a day especially in July, August and September. </p>
<p> Mauritius is a little cooler as it's further south, but with seven hours of sunshine from May to September it's ideal if you like don't like it too hot. </p>
<p> Finally, South Africa, Botswana and Namibia all have dry seasons from May to September with pleasant daytime temperatures and an impressive nine to 11 sunshine hours per day. </p>
<p> Naturally sunny regions </p>
<p> When it comes to finding sunshine, it's all about location, location, location. For example, the south of France has more than double the sunshine hours than the north of Scotland - the fact is, some places in the world enjoy more reliable weather conditions than others owing to their location. </p>
<p> Did you know? Inverness sees on average 1,245 hours of sunshine per year, while Nice gets around 2,690 hours </p>
<p> A few examples of places with naturally good weather include Florida, which is renowned for its year round sunshine thanks to rarely dropping below seven hours per day even in winter. </p>
<p> Hawaii, rising up out of the Pacific, is tropical with a dry summer season, and favoured by the sun gods with an average of 10 hours per day in July, dropping no lower than six hours in December. </p>
<p> Did you know? Locals think March to be the best month to visit Florida as it's sunny and warm without being too hot or prone to showers </p>
<p> Kenya and Tanzania too are blessed with ample hours of sunshine from January to December. Both straddle the equator, and despite two wet seasons, there is still a lot of sunshine. </p>
<p> For example, the Kenyan coast sees eight to nine hours of sunshine during its summer months from September to March. </p>
<p> In the popular game reserve areas of the Masai Mara in Kenya and Serengeti in Tanzania, there's never less than seven hours a day throughout the whole year - perfect for spotting leopards and watching loafing lions. </p>
<p> The world is full of places with lashings of sunshine hours. It's up to you how far you want to travel and when you want to go - once you know this, all you have to do is take your pick from the available options. </p>

<p> We kick off the week with rain </p>
<p> Plan on a soaker to kick off the workweek. It'll be rain most of today but as temps dive this afternoon, rain changes to snow. Plan on slushy snow, maybe heavy at times, through the night. </p>
<p> Round one: Another round of rain is en route! Monday morning is soaked with widespread and heavy rain. The heaviest rain is expected from 2 a.m. through 9 a.m. with scattered and lighter rain during Monday afternoon. Rain totals will be around half an inch to two inches with locally higher amounts by Monday night. Flooding will be possible on Monday as well. </p>
<p> Round two: As temperatures fall, wrap-around moisture is expected to transition from rain to snow showers by Monday afternoon and lingers into Tuesday. A round of lake effect snow will also be possible during this time. As of right now, snow totals look minor, less than two inches. Be sure to check back this weekend for the latest information! </p>

<p> 2021‚Äì2022 Winter Weather Forecast </p>
<p> Presenting the winter predictions from The 2022 Old Farmer‚Äôs Almanac! </p>
<p> The 2022 Old Farmer‚Äôs Almanac is now available! Pick up a copy of North America‚Äôs #1 Almanac and oldest continuously published periodical in stores across the United States and Canada. </p>
<p> Every year, the first questions that folks ask us are ‚ÄúWill this winter be a cold one?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhen will it snow?‚Äù Courtesy of the new 2022 edition, here are highlights from our annual winter weather predictions! </p>
<p> ‚ÄúA Season of Shivers‚Äù Predicted for the U.S. </p>
<p> Brrr! The 2022 Old Farmer‚Äôs Almanac comes with a winter warning: Prepare for a ‚ÄúSeason of Shivers.‚Äù This winter will be punctuated by positively bone-chilling, below-average temperatures across most of the United States. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúThis coming winter could well be one of the longest and coldest that we‚Äôve seen in years,‚Äù says Janice Stillman, editor of The Old Farmer‚Äôs Almanac. For 230 years, the Almanac has been helping readers to prepare for winter‚Äôs worst with its 80 percent‚Äìaccurate weather forecasts. </p>
<p> In some places, the super cold of the coming winter will also bring lots of snow. This extreme wintry mix is expected in areas of New England as well as throughout the Ohio Valley, in northern portions of the Deep South, and in southeast New Mexico. </p>
<p> Above-average snowfall is also in the forecast along a track from eastern Montana southward through the western halves of the Dakotas and into northeastern Colorado. While temperatures in this midcountry strip will be relatively normal, snowfall will be abundant, with several storms predicted throughout the winter. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, most western areas will remain relatively dry, with all but the Pacific Coast itself and portions of the Southwest experiencing the frigid cold predicted for much of the rest of the country. </p>
<p> Get Ready to ‚ÄúWeather the Storms‚Äù Across Canada </p>
<p> Canadians should be prepared to ‚ÄúWeather the Storms,‚Äù as winter will be punctuated by a series of storms leaving them snowed in, sleeted on, slushed about, soaked, and otherwise generally soggy. </p>
<p> ‚ÄúThis coming winter won‚Äôt be remarkable in terms of temperature, but for our Canadian friends who will end up just wanting to dry out, it will be a long season indeed,‚Äù says Editor Janice Stillman. Whether snow, sleet, or rain arrives will depend on location, location, location! </p>
<p> Snowfall will be above normal from western Atlantic Canada and eastern Quebec out through northern Ontario and the northern Prairies and into Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, and the Yukon. A series of back-to-back storms from mid-December to late January could leave Atlantic Canada snowed under for several weeks. </p>
<p> With slightly above-average temperatures throughout the season in all but the northernmost portions of the Prairies, winter storm clouds may sometimes bring rain or freezing rain across the nation‚Äôs midsection. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean that snow is completely out of the forecast: Major snowstorms are predicted for the Prairies in late November, mid-January, and early March. </p>
<p> This winter‚Äôs white-and-wet forecast will see colder-than-average temperatures from western Quebec into southern Ontario. While storms throughout the season are expected to bring plenty of rain, freezing rain, sleet, and flurries, snowfall itself will be below average overall. </p>
<p> The only place in Canada that won‚Äôt have many storms to weather is British Columbia, which should expect below-average precipitation and above-average temperatures throughout the season. </p>
<p> Find more regional forecasts for Canada and the U.S. below‚Äîand learn more about what‚Äôs inside The 2022 Old Farmer‚Äôs Almanac! </p>
<p> How Does the Almanac Predict the Weather </p>
<p> By tradition, The Old Farmer‚Äôs Almanac employs three scientific disciplines to make long-range predictions: solar science, the study of sunspots and other solar activity; climatology, the study of prevailing weather patterns; and meteorology, the study of the atmosphere. We predict weather trends and events by comparing solar patterns and historical weather conditions with current solar activity. </p>
<p> For the 2021‚Äì2022 weather predictions, the important factors which shape the weather include a weak La Ni√±a, a continued warm phase in the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), a neutral to positive phase in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in the early stages of its warm cycle. In addition, we are in the early stages of Solar Cycle 25, which is expected to bring very low solar activity‚Äîhistorically associated with cooler temperatures, on average, across Earth. </p>
<p> What‚Äôs Inside The 2022 Almanac? </p>
<p> In addition to its much-anticipated weather forecasts, The Old Farmer‚Äôs Almanac is known for being ‚Äúuseful, with a pleasant degree of humor.‚Äù Highlights from the 2022 Almanac include ‚Ä¶ </p>
<p> Gardening tips for growing a rainbow of dahlias or a patch of pumpkins (hint: the bumpier the skin, the sweeter the taste!), plus how to make scents of potpourri. </p>
<p> Recipes that make the most of the season, along with award-winning dishes and desserts that use five or fewer ingredients! </p>
<p> Dispatches from small farmers, including how they fared during 2020 and continue to diversify for the future. </p>
<p> The art and science of animal tracking, plus how to read Mother Nature‚Äôs signs to choose a fishing spot. </p>
<p> All this awaits in the 2022 Almanac, along with stories about gargantuan hail (is it becoming more common?); the 50th anniversary of an epic international sports showdown; an examination of teeth, from cradle to grave; the 17-year-old design genius behind the 50-star American flag (U.S. edition only); unique tourist locations that let visitors get up close to saints, war heroes, and even Roy Rogers‚Äô horse; 2022 home and lifestyle trends; and so much more! </p>
<p> Plus, your new 2022 edition includes everything that you expect and look forward to from the Almanac‚Äîmonthly calendars sprinkled with wit and wisdom, astronomical timetables, planting guides, and bits of valuable advice that continue The Old Farmer‚Äôs Almanac‚Äôs time-honored traditions. </p>
<p> Accept No Substitutes! </p>
<p> The Old Farmer‚Äôs Almanac Is North America‚Äôs Original Almanac! </p>
<p> There are other books out there that call themselves a ‚Äúfarmer‚Äôs almanac.‚Äù The Old Farmer‚Äôs Almanac‚Äîwith its familiar yellow cover‚Äîis the original and #1 across the United States and Canada. </p>

<p> Short Range Forecast Discussion NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD 356 AM EDT Tue Mar 29 2022 Valid 12Z Tue Mar 29 2022 - 12Z Thu Mar 31 2022 ...Severe thunderstorms and excessive rainfall threat on Tuesday into Thursday morning... ...Much below-average temperatures are expected from the Great Lakes into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, with records low temperatures possible on Tuesday... ...There is an Extreme Risk of fire weather over parts of the Southern High Plains on Tuesday... A deep upper-level trough over the Great Lakes to the Northeast moves eastward, which will allow temperatures to be 10 to 20 degrees below average over the region. As a result, the Tuesday s morning low temperatures will be a record or tied for a record low temperatures over several parts of the Great Lakes to the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Coast, which will start to moderate during the day. Meanwhile, a broad, deep upper-level low over Southern California to the Southwest on Tuesday will move steadily to the Mississippi Valley/Great Lakes by Thursday. Therefore, scattered light rain and higher elevation snow will develop over parts of Southern California to the Rockies through Wednesday morning. Furthermore, as the storm moves out of the Rockies overnight Tuesday, moisture will begin to flow northward over the Plains and Mississippi Valley. The moisture will aid in producing showers and thunderstorms over parts of the Central/Southern Plains and parts of the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley. Some of the thunderstorms will become severe. Therefore, from Tuesday into Wednesday morning, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Central/Southern Plains and parts of the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. Moreover, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms over the area on Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Furthermore, rain and snow will develop over parts of the Northern Plains also overnight Tuesday. An area of light rain/freezing rain will develop over a wide area from the Upper Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes and parts of the Central Appalachians overnight Tuesday into Thursday. Likewise, snow and rain/freezing rain will develop over parts of Northern New England overnight Wednesday into Thursday morning. Additionally, the threat of severe thunderstorms and excessive rainfall increases from Wednesday into Thursday morning. As the system moves eastward, the SPC has issued a Moderate Risk of severe thunderstorms over the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys and the Southeast on Wednesday into Thursday morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. Over the Central Gulf Coast, Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys, and the Southeast, there is an increased threat of EF2-EF5 tornadoes and severe thunderstorm wind gusts of 65 knots or greater. Moreover, due to the associated heavy rain, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Tennessee Valley/Southeast from Wednesday to Thursday morning. The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through Sunday morning. In addition, the SPC has issued an Extreme Risk of fire weather over parts of the Central/Southern High Plains Tuesday into Wednesday morning due to strong gusty winds, low relative humidity, and dry fuels. The threat reduces to a Critical Risk of fire weather on Wednesday into Thursday morning over the southern third of Texas.

<p> Extended Forecast Discussion NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD 257 AM EDT Tue Mar 29 2022 Valid 12Z Fri Apr 01 2022 - 12Z Tue Apr 05 2022 ...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment... The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a composite of best clustered guidance from the 12 UTC GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models days 3-5 (Friday-Sunday). Embedded smaller scale system differences and ample run to run continuity variances remain problematic despite reasonably similar larger scale pattern evolutions. Opted to blend just the generally compatible ensemble means by early next week to mitigate the less predictable forecast components amid steadily growing forecast spread. Overall, WPC product continuity is reasonably maintained with this strategy and the forecast seems in line with a similar composite of newer 00 UTC guidance. ...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats... A deep cyclone will eject across a stormy eastern Canada Friday as high winds and some wrapping snows persist to the lee of the Great Lakes and across the Northeast on the backside of the cyclone. A trailing front will sweep off the East Coast, but should stall and linger over Florida, the Gulf of Mexico/Gulf Coast and into northern Mexico. Upstream, a series of progressive upper troughs and frontal systems forecast to dig with some uncertainty through the West late week into early next week could each provide an opportunity for periods of modest wintry weather across the north-central Intermountain West/Rockies. System progressions downstream within an emerging southern stream may meanwhile favor modest precipitation from the central Plains and Midwest to the Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic, but deeper return moisture focus into wavy fronts and a stalled lead front offers potential to fuel some heavy downpours from the Gulf Coast to the Southeast into the weekend. By early next week there is also a growing guidance signal to bring more energetic Pacific jet flow toward the West Coast. This may transport deeper moisture to fuel and emerging precipitation pattern focus into the Pacific Northwest to include heavy terrain enhancing snows.

<p> Hawaii Extended Forecast Discussion NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD 302 AM EDT Tue Mar 29 2022 Valid 00Z Wed Mar 30 2022 - 00Z Wed Apr 06 2022 A favored composite of reasonably compatible guidance from the latest models and ensembles still indicates that weak upper troughing may provide some instability for shower activity across the islands into mid-late week in a pattern with light trades. High pressure set to re-establish to the north of the state may favor some deeper moisture transport into the southern islands as trades increasing return to brisker levels late week into next week. This may increase rainfall potential over favored windward terrain. Schichtel </p>
<p> Excessive Rainfall Discussion NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD 1153 AM EDT Tue Mar 29 2022 Day 1 Valid 16Z Tue Mar 29 2022 - 12Z Wed Mar 30 2022 ...A MARGINAL RISK OF EXCESSIVE RAINFALL EXISTS ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY... 16z Update: The previous outlook remains in good shape. We did expand the Marginal risk slightly to the north to account for a northward trend in convection along the low level convergence axis late this afternoon/evening from northeast KS into far southeast NE and southern IA. Overall, QPF from the 12z HREF members is not all that impressive. However, think rainfall amounts could very well end up a bit higher than indicated by these models from northeast TX into southeast OK and western AR. Low level moisture transport really ramps up this evening into the overnight hours...and while the convection should be progressive off to the east...a period of strengthening/persistent low level moisture transport over these areas suggests we could see a bit more backbuilding and periodic cell training than indicated by the high res guidance. Thus localized rainfall around 3" seems possible, posing an isolated flash flood risk. Chenard ...Previous Discussion... An anomalous closed upper low begins to open up as it sweeps through the Southwest into the Southern Plains while increasing south/southwest flow surges moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward. This low-level flow will become increasingly unidirectional with height while marginal amounts of instability build (750-1250 J/kg of MU CAPE, per the 00z HREF ensemble mean). After 00z Wednesday, the increasing low level jet and height falls aloft will allow for a line of showers and thunderstorms to develop across portions of the Plains (northern TX, central/eastern OK, eastern KS, western MO, western AR). IVT values approach 1000-1200 kg/ms with time in the general area while PWs exceed 1" which approaches +1.5 sigma (the 90th percentile climatologically) per the GEFS. Guidance has clustered on the idea of widespread 1-2" totals with isolated/localized amounts approaching 3" during the period (generally 00Z-12Z) which could fall in a quick period (1-2"/hr rates). The available hi-res guidance and ingredients in place suggest storm motion should be fairly progressive but where cell mergers and storm motions briefly align with mean flow, some repeating rounds and training could occur such that isolated higher rainfall amounts are possible. Soil moisture and streamflows are not overly wet/high, though recent 7 to 14 day rainfall departures show pockets of above normal precipitation (despite NASA SPoRT-LIS 0-40 cm soil moisture anomalies at or below the 20-30th percentile). Given all this, the Marginal Risk is maintained with minimal adjustments based on the latest guidance. Taylor/Churchill Day 1 threat area: www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/qpf/94epoints.txt </p>
<p> Excessive Rainfall Discussion NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD 424 AM EDT Tue Mar 29 2022 Day 2 Valid 12Z Wed Mar 30 2022 - 12Z Thu Mar 31 2022 ...A SLIGHT RISK OF EXCESSIVE RAINFALL EXISTS ACROSS PORTIONS OF MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA... A strong, complex upper-level trough with multiple embedded shortwaves will progress eastward from the Southern Plains into the Lower to Middle MS Valley Wednesday morning, then into the OH/TN Valleys towards the end of the Day 2 period. A large, broad warm sector will expand to cover much of the area as the associated surface low deepens to sub-990 mb and tracks NNE into the Great Lakes region. The most anomalous moisture looks to surge northward toward Lake Michigan on the back of 50-80 kts of 850 mb flow with the GEFS indicating PWATs surging to 1.2-1.6" (+2.0-3.0 SD, or exceeding the 80-90th percentile climatologically). The best instability certainly looks to be found farther south in the warm sector, surging to 1000-1500 J/kg of SB CAPE (per the GFS) from portions of the Deep South northward into the Mid-South, likely supporting rainfall rates of 1-2+"/hr along a maturing squall line. These ingredients result in a rather large 1+" QPF footprint for Day 2, generally encompassed by the Marginal Risk area. A substantial portion of the risk area will likely realize rainfall totals of 1-2", but the best signal for totals as high as 2-3" continues to exist across portions of Mississippi/Alabama. This makes sense given the expected maturing/bowing squall line, allowing the resulting outflow boundary to hang up from west-to-east, becoming more parallel to the mean flow aloft. This will likely allow for slower progression and training/repeating of heavy rainfall rates locally. Dry antecedent conditions will be the primary limiting factor overall for excessive rainfall potential, but localized areas in north-central AL are still as high as the 70th percentile per NASA SPoRT-LIS 0-40 cm soil moisture anomalies (while most locations elsewhere in the broad Marginal Risk area are near or even well below the 50th percentile).

<p> Excessive Rainfall Discussion NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD 432 AM EDT Tue Mar 29 2022 Day 3 Valid 12Z Thu Mar 31 2022 - 12Z Fri Apr 01 2022 ...A MARGINAL RISK OF EXCESSIVE RAINFALL EXISTS ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHEAST... A mature squall line is expected to be translating rapidly eastward across the Southeast U.S. at the beginning of Day 3 as an associated shortwave lifts northward into the base of a larger scale trough over the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Moisture looks plentiful along and ahead the line of storms, as the GEFS indicates PWATs of 1.2-1.6" (+1.0-2.0 SD, or approaching the 90th percentile climatologically) with more meager levels of instability (building to 500-1000 J/kg of SB CAPE with diurnal heating). The dynamic/progressive nature of the system will not allow for much training/repeating of 1-2"/hr rates by Day 3, but the best odds for this occurring are across the FL Panhandle/Big Bend where the surface boundary is more likely to hang up west-to-east (best depicted by the 00z NAM). This is also where antecedent conditions are most vulnerable, as soil moisture values per the NASA SPoRT-LIS 0-40 cm layer are still indicated to be near the 70th percentile climatologically. For the moment, opted to introduce a fairly broad Marginal Risk area that extends from north-central FL northward across much of GA, all of SC, and into southern portions of NC. A quick 1-2+" of rainfall will be possible across the risk area, particularly where any discrete cells are able to initiate and pre-saturate soils out ahead of the main squall line.

<p> Probabilistic Heavy Snow and Icing Discussion NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD 439 AM EDT Tue Mar 29 2022 Valid 12Z Tue Mar 29 2022 - 12Z Fri Apr 01 2022 ...Central and Southern Rockies... Day 1... Closed mid-level low moving across CA this morning will gradually weaken today into an open trough an d shift into the Four Corners and then Central Plains by Wednesday morning. Confluent flow downstream of this trough axis will continue to interact with a subtropical Pacific jet streak to enhance moisture across the region, with impressive ascent through height falls and LFQ diffluence driving rounds of precipitation across the Southwest and into the Central Rockies. Snow levels within the warm airmass will generally be 6000-8000 ft, highest south, with significant accumulations of snow likely above these levels. WPC probabilities for more than 6 inches of snowfall are above 70% in the San Juans, White Mountains of AZ, Sangre De Cristos, and many of the CO Rockies, including the Front Range. Lighter accumulations are likely in the Mogollon Rim, the Uinta Range, the higher terrain of WY, and across the Raton Mesa and Palmer Divide. ...Northern Plains through the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, and New England... Days 1-3... Complex mid-level pattern development will produce a long duration winter weather event during the next 3 days. While the most significant impacts and accumulations are likely in the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes, impactful winter weather is possible across a large area from North Dakota through Pennsylvania and Maine. The guidance has come into at least subtly better agreement tonight that two distinct waves of low pressure will move from the Plains through the Great Lakes, with the associated WAA out ahead of the lows spreading wintry precipitation as far east as Maine. The first wave will emerge out of the lee of the Rockies this aftn and then shift rapidly northeast into the Great Lakes by Wednesday morning. This low will deepen slightly as it lifts northeast in response to modest height falls and strengthening LFQ upper diffluence as an anticyclonically curved jet streak blossoms downstream of the mid-level longwave trough axis. This forcing will combine with increasing moist advection out of the Gulf of Mexico, the result of which will be a swath of snow and sleet from SD through MN and the western U.P, with moderate freezing rain likely from eastern MN through WI, the L.P. of MI, and southeast into the Laurel Highlands of PA. This event will be fast moving, but anomalous moisture will still allow for heavy accumulation potential of snow and freezing rain. WPC probabilities for more than 4 inches of snow D1 as high as 20% in the Coteau des Prairies, with freezing rain exceeding 0.1" most likely in north-central WI and the L.P. of MI. As this system continues northeast into D2, heavy snow on the NW side of the low will continue in eastern SD and ND, and spread into the northern half of MN including the Arrowhead, where WPC probabilities for 4+ inches reach above 40%. Additional freezing rain is likely into D2 across northern WI, the U.P., and the northern L.P. as well, with storm total freezing rain possibly reaching 0.25" in a few locations. As wave 1 pulls away to the northeast and weakens, renewed shortwave energy digging into the mean trough will combine with intensifying upper diffluence within an coupled jet structure to drive a stronger wave of low pressure from the Southern Plains northeast into the Great Lakes D2-3. This low will likely produce more significant wintry precipitation, as impressive theta-e ridging rotates cyclonically into a TROWAL over the Upper Midwest, and overlaps with a potent deformation axis that now has good model support late D2 into D3. Where this axis pivots, snowfall rates in excess of 1"/hr are likely despite modest SLRs as theta-e lapse rates fall below 0C suggesting CSI potential. While the models are in better agreement that this deformation will occur, there are still significant longitudinal discrepancies, leading to lowered confidence in where the heaviest snow will occur. There is also concern that some of this area will be rain initially, and the timing of the transition to snow as CAA strengthens behind the low will have a significant impact on snowfall accumulations. At this time the heaviest snow is most likely in a narrow corridor from southwest WI through the western U.P. of MI where WPC probabilities on D2 are as high as 70% for 4+ inches, with additional heavy snow likely across the U.P. D3, first with this heavy snow band, and later with impressive LES off Lake Superior. Both the WSE and NBM have increased their snowfall for this area D2-3, and locally 12 inches of snow is possible where the best overlap of LES and banded snow occur. Finally, as the entire system shifts northeast, WAA precipitation into the terrain of VT/NH/ME may produce some light accumulations of freezing rain, but WPC probabilities for more than 0.1" of accretion are only 5-10%.

<p> Extended Forecast Discussion NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD 257 AM EDT Tue Mar 29 2022 Valid 12Z Fri Apr 01 2022 - 12Z Tue Apr 05 2022 ...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment... The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a composite of best clustered guidance from the 12 UTC GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models days 3-5 (Friday-Sunday). Embedded smaller scale system differences and ample run to run continuity variances remain problematic despite reasonably similar larger scale pattern evolutions. Opted to blend just the generally compatible ensemble means by early next week to mitigate the less predictable forecast components amid steadily growing forecast spread. Overall, WPC product continuity is reasonably maintained with this strategy and the forecast seems in line with a similar composite of newer 00 UTC guidance. ...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats... A deep cyclone will eject across a stormy eastern Canada Friday as high winds and some wrapping snows persist to the lee of the Great Lakes and across the Northeast on the backside of the cyclone. A trailing front will sweep off the East Coast, but should stall and linger over Florida, the Gulf of Mexico/Gulf Coast and into northern Mexico. Upstream, a series of progressive upper troughs and frontal systems forecast to dig with some uncertainty through the West late week into early next week could each provide an opportunity for periods of modest wintry weather across the north-central Intermountain West/Rockies. System progressions downstream within an emerging southern stream may meanwhile favor modest precipitation from the central Plains and Midwest to the Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic, but deeper return moisture focus into wavy fronts and a stalled lead front offers potential to fuel some heavy downpours from the Gulf Coast to the Southeast into the weekend. By early next week there is also a growing guidance signal to bring more energetic Pacific jet flow toward the West Coast. This may transport deeper moisture to fuel and emerging precipitation pattern focus into the Pacific Northwest to include heavy terrain enhancing snows.
