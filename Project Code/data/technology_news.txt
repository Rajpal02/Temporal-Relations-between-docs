<doc id="file24175615" filename="2022-03-robotic-pizza-making.html" parent_folder="web1" url="https://techxplore.com/news/2022-03-robotic-pizza-making.html">
<p> Solving the challenges of robotic pizza-making </p>
<p> Imagine a pizza maker working with a ball of dough. She might use a spatula to lift the dough onto a cutting board then use a rolling pin to flatten it into a circle. Easy, right? Not if this pizza maker is a robot. </p>
<p> For a robot, working with a deformable object like dough is tricky because the shape of dough can change in many ways, which are difficult to represent with an equation. Plus, creating a new shape out of that dough requires multiple steps and the use of different tools. It is especially difficult for a robot to learn a manipulation task with a long sequence of steps—where there are many possible choices—since learning often occurs through trial and error. </p>
<p> Researchers at MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, and the University of California at San Diego, have come up with a better way. They created a framework for a robotic manipulation system that uses a two-stage learning process, which could enable a robot to perform complex dough-manipulation tasks over a long timeframe. A "teacher" algorithm solves each step the robot must take to complete the task. Then, it trains a "student" machine-learning model that learns abstract ideas about when and how to execute each skill it needs during the task, like using a rolling pin. With this knowledge, the system reasons about how to execute the skills to complete the entire task. </p>
<p> The researchers show that this method, which they call DiffSkill, can perform complex manipulation tasks in simulations, like cutting and spreading dough, or gathering pieces of dough from around a cutting board, while outperforming other machine-learning methods. </p>
<p> Beyond pizza-making, this method could be applied in other settings where a robot needs to manipulate deformable objects, such as a caregiving robot that feeds, bathes, or dresses someone elderly or with motor impairments. </p>
<p> "This method is closer to how we as humans plan our actions. When a human does a long-horizon task, we are not writing down all the details. We have a higher-level planner that roughly tells us what the stages are and some of the intermediate goals we need to achieve along the way, and then we execute them," says Yunzhu Li, a graduate student in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), and author of a paper presenting DiffSkill. </p>
<p> Li's co-authors include lead author Xingyu Lin, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU); Zhiao Huang, a graduate student at the University of California at San Diego; Joshua B. Tenenbaum, the Paul E. Newton Career Development Professor of Cognitive Science and Computation in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT and a member of CSAIL; David Held, an assistant professor at CMU; and senior author Chuang Gan, a research scientist at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Learning Representations. </p>
<p> Student and teacher </p>
<p> The "teacher" in the DiffSkill framework is a trajectory optimization algorithm that can solve short-horizon tasks, where an object's initial state and target location are close together. The trajectory optimizer works in a simulator that models the physics of the real world (known as a differentiable physics simulator, which puts the "Diff" in "DiffSkill"). The "teacher" algorithm uses the information in the simulator to learn how the dough must move at each stage, one at a time, and then outputs those trajectories. </p>
<p> Then the "student" neural network learns to imitate the actions of the teacher. As inputs, it uses two camera images, one showing the dough in its current state and another showing the dough at the end of the task. The neural network generates a high-level plan to determine how to link different skills to reach the goal. It then generates specific, short-horizon trajectories for each skill and sends commands directly to the tools. </p>
<p> The researchers used this technique to experiment with three different simulated dough-manipulation tasks. In one task, the robot uses a spatula to lift dough onto a cutting board then uses a rolling pin to flatten it. In another, the robot uses a gripper to gather dough from all over the counter, places it on a spatula, and transfers it to a cutting board. In the third task, the robot cuts a pile of dough in half using a knife and then uses a gripper to transport each piece to different locations. </p>
<p> A cut above the rest </p>
<p> DiffSkill was able to outperform popular techniques that rely on reinforcement learning, where a robot learns a task through trial and error. In fact, DiffSkill was the only method that was able to successfully complete all three dough manipulation tasks. Interestingly, the researchers found that the "student" neural network was even able to outperform the "teacher" algorithm, Lin says. </p>
<p> "Our framework provides a novel way for robots to acquire new skills. These skills can then be chained to solve more complex tasks which are beyond the capability of previous robot systems," says Lin. </p>
<p> Because their method focuses on controlling the tools (spatula, knife, rolling pin, etc.) it could be applied to different robots, but only if they use the specific tools the researchers defined. In the future, they plan to integrate the shape of a tool into the reasoning of the "student" network so it could be applied to other equipment. </p>
<p> The researchers intend to improve the performance of DiffSkill by using 3D data as inputs, instead of images that can be difficult to transfer from simulation to the real world. They also want to make the neural network planning process more efficient and collect more diverse training data to enhance DiffSkill's ability to generalize to new situations. In the long run, they hope to apply DiffSkill to more diverse tasks, including cloth manipulation. </p>

<p> ASUS announces new detachable laptop </p>
<p> ASUS has announced Transformer Book T101, the latest addition to its series of 2-in-1 detachable laptops. The 10.1-inch Transformer Book T101 has a metallic design and is light and compact, weighing only 580g as a tablet or just 1.08kg with the keyboard attached. It features a reversible magnetic hinge that allows its display to be flipped over, giving the convenience of four versatile modes: a conventional lightweight laptop, a handy tablet, tent mode for easy screen-sharing, and stand mode as a personal movie theatre. With its incredibly long up to 11-hour battery life, dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi, full-size USB port, and complete Windows 10 functionality, Transformer Book T101 is the ideal mobile companion. </p>
<p> Durable and stylish ASUS Transformer Book T101 is stylish and elegant, with a premium all-aluminium tablet and a keyboard surround that features a chic honeycomb-inspired textured pattern. The aluminium construction not only looks great, but it makes Transformer Book T101 more durable and resistant to everyday knocks and bumps than rival products with a cheaper plastic construction. Lightweight aluminium also allows Transformer Book T101’s tablet to be very slim and light at only 580g, making it ideal as a mobile lifestyle companion. The device is available in three vibrant colours: Rose Gold, Mint Green and Glacier Gray. </p>
<p> Versatile reversible hinge ASUS Transformer Book T101 features a reversible magnetic hinge connecting the tablet and keyboard. This solidly-engineered hinge allows the tablet to be detached, flipped over and reattached, giving two convenient extra modes in addition to the standard laptop and tablet configurations. Tent mode is great for sharing the screen contents with a group of people, while stand mode turns Transformer Book T101 into a compact personal movie theatre. </p>
<p> Powerful, precisely positioned magnets ensure that the tablet can be attached quickly and accurately with minimal effort. To ensure long-term reliability, the reversible hinge has been rigorously tested with a 25,000-cycle mechanical hinge-swing test. The slim keyboard has ergonomic keys with a 1.5mm key travel— longer than that of most mobile keyboards, and the same as a full-size laptop. This long key travel provides more reassuring feedback for every key strike and replicates the comfortable typing experience of a full-size laptop. The keyboard also features a Precision Touchpad with support for Windows gestures. This touchpad has palm-rejection technology that intelligently recognizes and ignores accidental presses of the palm during typing, allowing users to rest their hands naturally and comfortably while typing. </p>
<p> Clear, sharp and bright display The anti-glare touchscreen display on ASUS Transformer Book T101 has a sharp 1280 by 800 resolution, and with up to 400cd/m2 brightness it is one of the brightest 10.1-inch displays. It has wide 178° viewing angles, and ASUS TruVivid direct-bonding technology ensures higher transparency and improved clarity, with fewer reflections in bright environments — even in bright sunlight. Exclusive ASUS Tru2Life video-enhancement technology — similar to that found in high-end TVs — uses intelligent software algorithms to optimise the sharpness and contrast of every video frame, so that videos look clearer, more detailed and more realistic. </p>
<p> Powerful components Inside its compact chassis ASUS Transformer Book T101 packs powerful components that include the latest quad-core Intel Atom X5 Series (‘Cherry Trail’) processor, up to 4GB of RAM, up to 128GB eMMC storage, a micro SD Card reader that can support up to 512GB cards, and fast dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi. These components operate in complete silence thanks to Transformer Book T101’s fan-less design, allowing users to work or play without distracting noises. It also comes with a more comprehensive set of connectors than other similar-sized devices. These include a full-size (Type-A ) USB 2.0 port, a micro HDMI display port, and a micro USB port that can also be used for charging the device. The micro USB port also supports charging from external power banks, enabling users to extend the already impressive up to 11-hour battery life even further, for true all-day convenience. </p>
<p> A one-year unlimited subscription to ASUS WebStorage is included with Transformer Book T101, allowing users to store and access their files from all their devices, anywhere and anytime. </p>
<p> An amazing Windows experience ASUS Transformer Book T101 supports Cortana, the innovative Windows personal assistant that allows natural interaction via its powerful voice-recognition technology. Transformer Book T101 also supports Windows 10 Continuum, which automatically detects if the keyboard is attached and reconfigures itself for the ideal user experience as a laptop or tablet. Transformer Book T101 also comes with Microsoft Office Mobile pre-installed, giving users immediate access to the powerful Word Mobile, Excel Mobile, PowerPoint Mobile and OneNote apps. ASUS Transformer Book T101 will be available from November. </p>

<p> Home Tech News A Swiss company claims it used quantum computers to find weakness in encryption </p>
<p> A Swiss company claims it used quantum computers to find weakness in encryption </p>
<p> Terra Quantum AG said its discovery “upends the current understanding of what constitutes unbreakable” encryption and could have major implications for the world’s leading technology companies, such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp., and International Business Machines Corp. </p>
<p> Security experts have long worried that advances in quantum computing could eventually make it easier to break encryption that protects the privacy of people’s data. That’s because these sophisticated machines can perform calculations at speeds impossible for conventional computers, potentially enabling them to crack codes previously thought indecipherable. </p>
<p> Now, a Swiss technology company says it has made a breakthrough by using quantum computers to uncover vulnerabilities in commonly used encryption. The company believes it’s found a security weakness that could jeopardize the confidentiality of the world’s internet data, banking transactions and emails. </p>
<p> Terra Quantum AG said its discovery “upends the current understanding of what constitutes unbreakable” encryption and could have major implications for the world’s leading technology companies, such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp., and International Business Machines Corp. </p>
<p> But some other security experts said they aren’t nearly ready to declare a major breakthrough, at least not until the company publishes the full details of its research. “If true, this would be a huge result,” said Brent Waters, a computer science professor who specialises in cryptography at the University of Texas at Austin. “It seems somewhat unlikely on the face of it. However, it is pretty hard for experts to weigh in on something without it being published.” </p>
<p> IBM spokesman Christopher Sciacca said his company has known the risks for 20 years and is working on its own solutions to address the issue of post-quantum security. “This is why the National Institute of Science & Technology (NIST) has been hosting a challenge to develop a new quantum safe crypto standard,” he said in an email. “IBM has several proposals for this new standard in the final round, which is expected in a few years.” </p>
<p> Brian LaMacchia, distinguished engineer at Microsoft, said company cryptographers are collaborating with the global cryptographic community to prepare customers and data centers for a quantum future. “Preparing for security in a post-quantum world is important not only to protect and secure data in the future but also to ensure that future quantum computers are not a threat to the long-term security of today’s information.” </p>
<p> Google didn’t reply to a message seeking comment. </p>
<p> Terra Quantum AG has a team of about 80 quantum physicists, cryptographers and mathematicians, who are based in Switzerland, Russia, Finland and the US “What currently is viewed as being post-quantum secure is not post-quantum secure,” said Markus Pflitsch, chief executive officer and founder of Terra Quantum, in an interview. “We can show and have proven that it isn’t secure and is hackable.” </p>
<p> Pflitsch founded the company in 2019. He’s a former finance executive who began his career as a research scientist at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. Terra Quantum’s research is led by two chief technology officers – Gordey Lesovik, head of the Laboratory of Quantum Information Technology at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, and Valerii Vinokur, a Chicago-based physicist who in 2020 won the Fritz London Memorial Prize for his work in condensed matter and theoretical physics. </p>
<p> The company said that its research found vulnerabilities that affect symmetric encryption ciphers, including the Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, which is widely used to secure data transmitted over the internet and to encrypt files. Using a method known as quantum annealing, the company said its research found that even the strongest versions of AES encryption may be decipherable by quantum computers that could be available in a few years from now. </p>
<p> Vinokur said in an interview that Terra Quantum’s team made the discovery after figuring out how to invert what’s called a “hash function,” a mathematical algorithm that converts a message or portion of data into a numerical value. The research will show that “what was once believed unbreakable doesn’t exist anymore,” Vinokur said, adding that the finding “means a thousand other ways can be found soon.” </p>
<p> The company, which is backed by the Zurich-based venture capital firm Lakestar LP, has developed a new encryption protocol that it says can’t be broken by quantum computers. Vinokur said the new protocol utilizes a method known as quantum key distribution. </p>
<p> Terra Quantum is currently pursuing a patent for the new protocol. But the company will make it available for free, according to Pflitsch. “We will open up access to our protocol to make sure we have a safe and secure environment,” said Pflitsch. “We feel obliged to share it with the world and the quantum community.” </p>
<p> The US government, like China, has made research in quantum computing research an economic and national security priority, saying that the world is on the cusp of what it calls a new “quantum revolution.” In addition, technology companies including Google, Microsoft, and IBM have made large investments in quantum computing in recent years. </p>

<doc id="file24175678" filename="best-laptops-for-video-editing" parent_folder="web1" url="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-laptops-for-video-editing">
<p> We’ve employed our tech expertise to help you find the best video editing laptops </p>
<p> Not just any portable will do if you want the best laptop for video editing. You could splurge on the most powerful laptop, and that still won’t ensure that you’re getting the best tool for trimming, color correcting and/or grading, and rendering your videos. Sure, you will need powerful internals, especially a robust graphics card and a fast memory. If you’re a pro, you’ll need to go for the higher-end ones to run programs with big hardware requirements such as non-linear video editors like Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve. </p>
<p> However, there are a few other things to tick off the list. A display with excellent contrast, high brightness level, and the right color space (Rec. 709 and DCI-P3 are pretty much the standard for video editors and colorists) is absolutely necessary. Even if you’ve got a monitor you can hook up your laptop to, your laptop’s display should be up to par as well for when you’re traveling or in the field. Choose a laptop that’s also compatible with the apps you use for your daily workflow, such as DVD burning software, video converter software, and, of course, video editors. </p>
<p> To help you weed through all the different laptops out there, we’ve compiled the best laptops for video editing, including options for varying budgets and some of the best mobile workstations out there. </p>
<p> How to choose a video editing laptop </p>
<p> Most video editing software depends on the GPU; therefore, a powerful graphics card is necessary to edit effectively. Video editing apps are also heavyweight in terms of memory usage, so the more the better. To work with heavyweight video editors like Adobe Premiere you will need 16GB of RAM to plod away comfortably, although technically it can run with just 8GB. A fast GPU will also help once you get past simple chopping up footage and start adding transitions, overlays and other fancy effects. </p>
<p> Finally, the operating system should have a rather large solid state disk so both it and applications load and run quickly with plenty of scratch space. Ultimately though, it will be the resolution of your video production which will steer you towards your final system requirements, with screen size being one of the most important. In general, if your video production is "full HD" or 1080P any laptop will be adequate. However, once you move to 2K or higher, you will prefer a "higher than Full HD" screen resolution on your system, we're talking QHD and UHD for working with 2K and 4K video, respectively. </p>
<p> Other good factors to consider are choosing a device that is expandable (so that you can add more memory or an additional SSD if necessary), one that comes with next business day warranty (or at least offers it as an option) and a device that features ample connectivity as users are likely to transfer files via cloud storage or via external storage (most likely a portable SSD). </p>
<p> How we chose the best video editing laptops </p>
<p> We took into account the recommended hardware requirements from popular non-linear video editors and published benchmarks like Puget Systems’ Premiere Pro benchmark. Given the above requirements and information, we selected laptops with 16GB of RAM or more -32GB preferred- with 1TB or more of fast internal SSD storage and the latest-generation CPUs from AMD, Intel and Apple. We had to make an exception in the rugged category as an Intel i7 is the fastest at the time of writing. </p>
<p> As a result, a laptop chosen from this list will be as suitable for the task at hand a year down the line as it is today. Offerings from Apple, Dell, Lenovo, HP, and Razer all provide suitable options for video editing, including a rugged laptop for working outdoors. It is no surprise that some entries are business laptops while others are marketed as gaming laptops: modern games are resource-intensive in terms of CPU, RAM and GPU, so gaming laptops are exceptionally well suited for pro video editing. Unless otherwise noted all systems feature a SD card reader slot. </p>
<p> Reasons to buy </p>
<p> Plenty of ports </p>
<p> Reasons to avoid </p>
<p> - </p>
<p> On the bigger side </p>
<p> The larger of Apple’s new Pro laptops contains about as much performance as you can ask for in a notebook, powered by either Apple’s Soc 10-core M1 Pro or M1 Max SoC (system on a chip). Not only is that 8 performance cores and 2 efficiency cores of processing power but, since it’s a system on a chip, you also get either 16 or 32 cores handling your graphics. Add in up to 64GB of RAM (32 if you stick with the M1 Pro and this powerhouse will rip through any project you throw at it. Since you can upgrade the SSD to up to 8TB of storage, you can skip carrying around an extra drive for storage. That is, if you’re willing to pay. </p>
<p> The main drawback of the MacBook Pro 16-Inch (2021) is its price. If this is more power than you need in a computer, there are other options on this list that cost less than half the 16-Inch’s base model. It’s also a bit on the bigger side, weighing 4.7 pounds or 2.1 kgs, making it a little less portable than the 14-inch model or a lot of other options here. </p>
<p> However, if you’re willing to pay and carry the extra weight, there’s a lot more than just the performance of the new M1 chips. That gorgeous mini-LED XDR display gives you 254 pixels per inch as well as up to 1600 nits of peak brightness, making this an easy screen to use. It also comes with plenty of ports including 3 Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI port, an SDXC card slot, and the return of the MagSafe port so all your Thunderbolt ports are available even when charging. If that isn’t enough, the battery life is stellar, especially for a larger notebook. </p>
<p> Best overall: Large 4K UHD screen, an incredible thin package and desktop-level performance </p>
<p> Reasons to buy </p>
<p> Reasons to avoid </p>
<p> - </p>
<p> Only Thunderbolt ports </p>
<p> - </p>
<p> Expensive </p>
<p> Engaging in 4K video editing on a laptop with the same power as a desktop workstation and a UHD display wasn’t until recently a realistic proposition but now it is. Packed in its sleek, thin design is an Intel i9-11900H processor, a beefed up Nvidia RTX3060 graphics card, 32 GB of memory and a generous and fast 1TB SSD. </p>
<p> It also looks gorgeous: A silver aluminum lid and bottom cover the laptop and a black soft-touch deck interior and palm rests are coated with carbon fiber. The laptop's keyboard comes with Dell's trademark backlit design. Expansion is provided via its four Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) ports which also supply power. Ideal for connecting fast external solid state disks or HDDs to deliver your final video workload. Or you can do it wirelessly to the cloud via Wi-Fi 6. </p>
<p> The UHD display is a must for accurate 4K video edits and this laptop delivers with a cherry on top. What Dell calls a 4-side InfinityEdge display is actually a thin bezel surrounding the actual screen. That means you get the largest screen possible without enlarging the rest of the laptop. If you buy direct, keep in mind that the lead time can extend for weeks: the firm has warned about “industry-wide, unprecedented component shortages” and leads users to its “supply chain updates” page here. </p>
<p> Best value for the money: a portable, fast editing machine that doesn't break the bank </p>

<p> Reasons to buy </p>
<p> Assortment of traditional ports </p>
<p> Reasons to avoid </p>
<p> - </p>
<p> Flimsy-feeling chassis </p>
<p> Modern games are resource-intensive in terms of CPU, RAM and GPU, making gaming laptops totally apt for video editing. Despite being marketed to gamers it features a professional looking matte black casing suitable for taking it to the office. Videographers will like its two video outputs: HDMI and Mini-Display port meaning you can probably hook it up to a wide range of monitors or TVs. </p>
<p> At half the price of the most expensive workstation-level laptops, it pack a top of the line processor and GPU: an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX with eight cores, well suited for processor-intensive video editing workloads and a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 which will bring an extra speed boost when video rendering as Adobe Premiere now supports GPU-assisted encoding and decoding. </p>
<p> Its 15.4 inch 2K (QHD or quad high definition) display will help video editors get the most out of complex applications like DaVinci Resolve and others while its resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels means you can preview video up to 2K with high detail. </p>
<p> When it comes to expandability it's got plenty, you´ll find a Gigabit Ethernet port on the left side alongside the HDMI port, one USB-A port, a built-in SD card reader, and charging and headphone ports. On the right you´ll find one USB-C, two USB-A ports and a Mini-DisplayPort. </p>

<p> Gorgeous display </p>
<p> Reasons to avoid </p>
<p> - </p>
<p> Notch at the top of the display </p>
<p> Apple's update to the smaller of its Pro lineup can be powered by either the new 8-core M1 Pro or 10-core M1 Max chips, which features six or eight performance cores and two efficiency cores. The new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips are twice as fast as the Intel Core i9 in the MacBook Pro 16-inch (2019). Since memory is packaged in the M1 silicon your choice of CPU dictates the maximum amount of RAM: the M1 Pro maxes out at 32GB RAM, the M1 Max at 64GB. </p>
<p> Apple calls its display Liquid Retina XDR. With 14.2-inches it can display a 3024-by-1964 resolution at a 120Hz refresh rate. Expansion comes via three Thunderbolt 4 ports, one HDMI port, an SDXC card slot, and a MagSafe 3 port. All this comes with a price in addition to the high price tag- as it is heavier and thicker than the previous model. The new MacBook Pro 14-inch with the M1 Pro chip weighs 3.5lbs (1.6kg). </p>
<p> As far as performance is concerned, Apple has provided the following impressive benchmark numbers using several video editors: “Up to 9.2x faster 4K render in Final Cut Pro with M1 Pro, and up to 13.4x faster with M1 Max. Up to 3.6x faster effect render in DaVinci Resolve Studio with M1 Pro and up to 5x faster with M1 Max”. </p>

<p> If you need to edit video outdoors you could face dusty, wet, or risky environments. That's where a rugged laptop comes in handy. These are designed with a thicker and stronger enclosures to operate reliably in industrial, construction and military settings. </p>
<p> Dell took it to extremes; this beast is drop-tested for impact resistance from 6 feet and is water resistant with an IP-65 rating which means it has protection against "low pressure water jets from any direction, water condensation and water spray". The downside for the Jacques Costeau fans is that you cannot use it *totally* underwater. </p>
<p> You can also work beneath direct sunlight thanks to its multi-touch Full-HD display with up to 1000 nits of brightness. With its smaller 14" screen, you will likely need to connect it to a bigger external display but this is possible thanks to its plethora of ports: HDMI is included, and VGA or DisplayPort secondary connectors are optional, or you can use USB-C. </p>
<p> As usual in all Dell systems, you can use its online configurator and have your desired machine tailor-made with additional storage or ports. It supports up to 3 removable M.2 SSDs for up to 3TB of storage. When you add the discrete AMD GPU to replace the built in Intel HD graphics, a secondary battery becomes mandatory. The default configuration includes an internal 4G LTE modem which you can remove for additional cost savings if not needed. Other optional features are a fingerprint reader and a smartcard reader. </p>
<p> The only caveat about this system is if you use Adobe Premiere, as the firm lists 2GB as the minimum video memory for its NLVE, so this system hits that spec narrowly. </p>
<p> 6. Lenovo ThinkPad P17 Mobile Workstation </p>
<p> Best for power users: a desktop workstation disguised in a laptop form factor </p>
<p> Reasons to buy </p>
<p> Reasons to avoid </p>
<p> - </p>
<p> Heavy and bulky </p>
<p> - </p>
<p> Short battery life </p>
<p> This is truly a mobile workstation. It can be expanded to levels not possible in the average laptop. For instance, while most laptops feature either one or two sockets for RAM or even memory soldered to the mainboard, this system has four sockets. It also features two M.2 NVMe SSD slots. </p>
<p> Need to edit 4K video at 60 FPS with dual 4K monitors? Sure, no problem. This beast handles that and more thanks to its 3840×2160 17.3 inch anti-glare screen with sharp, crisp colors. We've chosen a version with 64GB of RAM which doubles the recommended settings for the king of high-end non-linear video editors, Davinci Resolve (16GB minimum, 32GB recommended). </p>
<p> You can find this laptop with many different CPU options including Intel Core processors and Xeon processors. Likewise with Nvidia Quadro GPU options. One popular option for video editing is to buy it with two 2TB SSDs, OPAL encryption is also an option. Lenovo´s online configurator lets you go crazy. </p>
<p> As for expandability it sports four USB-A 3.2 (Gen 1) ports, USB-C, two Thunderbolt 3, Gigabit Ethernet and HDMI 2.0 ports. Due to its power requirements it has its own separate power socket. </p>
<p> Yes, its battery life is short, but have you seen the size of this thing? It's a movable workstation. If you need to carry it around in a backpack, the 15.6-inch ThinkPad P15 is a more appropriate option, but for a video editing workstation that will likely stay plugged into AC and stationary during most of your video editing session, the power and flexibility of editing 4K video on a 17 inch screen can't be beaten. </p>
<p> Reasons to buy </p>
<p> Reasons to avoid </p>
<p> - </p>
<p> No Ethernet </p>
<p> If you are looking for the right balance between power and portability look no further than the Razer Blade 14. Sporting NVIDIA´s RTX3070 discrete GPU and AMD's latest processor it features a nice 14-inch display, in less than a four pound package (1.77 kg). </p>
<p> Despite being marketed as a gaming laptop, its CNC machined black aluminum case looks stylish and professional. It has a beautiful Quad-HD display -QHD or sometimes referred to as 2K- with a resolution of 2,560 by 1,440 pixels. </p>
<p> Its powerful eight core AMD CPU coupled with Nvidia's GPU means that this laptop has enough horsepower to run the most demanding non-linear video editors comfortably. Speaking of which, its only downside is that the RAM is not user upgradeable. The good news is that the SSD can be accessed and upgraded effortlessly. </p>
<p> As for expandability, it sports two USB 3.2 Type A sockets, two USB-C 3.2 connections with charging capability and a handy HDMI port for external monitors. Its lack of Thunderbolt support on the USB-C connectors can be an annoyance for some users though. </p>
<p> Finally, we should mention that for those cash-strapped, this system can also be found at a lower price with a 1080P screen and with a RTX 3060. In all of its options, at 0.66 inches thick, it is a worthy video editing workhorse that you can carry in your backpack. </p>

<p> If you edit video while on the go a "convertible laptop" or 2-in-1 laptop can be handy to boost your creative process. You can use it as a tablet for previewing your source material or exploring transitions with the touch screen, then the next minute load up your complex non-linear video editor and use it with the keyboard like a regular laptop. If you want to read more on the advantages of this form factor, check out our article here. </p>
<p> The HP Envy's 15.6-inch, full HD 1080P WLED display looks gorgeous and is more than adequate for video editing on the go. If need be, you can connect it to an external monitor or large screen TV via its HDMI or DisplayPort via USB-C. While this isn't a 4K 17-inch screen laptop replacement, what you lose by not having an extra-large display and 4K resolution you make up for when it comes to battery life. </p>
<p> Packed inside is an eight-core AMD Ryzen 7 5700U with Vega graphics, a speedy CPU that makes up for the lack of a discrete GPU. Its terabyte of fast SSD storage will make working with heavy video editing programs a breeze. When it comes to expansion, it sports one USB-C port -luckily of the USB 3.2 Gen 2 type (10 Gb/s with Power Delivery), one HDMI 2.0, two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, a micro-SD card reader and headphone jack. Connectivity is provided via built-in Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5. With its well-engineered design, a comparative low price and excellent display, the HP Envy x360 is one of the best options for video editing enthusiasts on the move. </p>
<p> Buying a video editing laptop? Here's what experts say </p>
<p> We reached out to Michel Yavercovski, Senior Director of Product Management for Corel video products, to get his expert opinions about choosing a creative computer. </p>
<p> "There are a few key things to look for when buying a video editing laptop and of course, when you’re talking about video, the better the hardware, the smoother and more responsive your editing experience will be. Whether you’re talking about our Pinnacle Studio or VideoStudio products, both have been designed to take full benefit of your hardware to make video editing as fast and efficient as possible." Michel said. </p>
<p> "First, you’ll want to look for a system with a powerful multicore processor -- the Intel Core i7 product line is a good choice to get started with -- and our software has been optimized to take advantage of multithreading so you can get the most out of these impressive chips. A powerful processor will also give you a seamless experience when working with today’s popular formats and creative features like multi-camera and 360° video support. 4K video can create huge file sizes, so you’ll also want to make sure the device has a large and fast SSD storage drive that can read and write large video files without any hang-ups." </p>
<p> "Video editing takes up a lot of memory, so shop for a system that has between 16GB and 32GB of RAM to keep things running smoothly. And, of course, a 64-bit version of Windows 10 is a must. " he added. </p>
<p> "Then, when considering graphics cards, look for the latest NVIDIA GeForce RTX or GTX series as well as Intel Iris or HD Graphics for overall faster processing and editing. Most advanced graphics cards will also have HEVC support, enabling the use of this advanced video format in your productions." </p>
<p> "Since you’ll be working primarily on one screen when you’re on the go, make sure the laptop's built-in monitor produces crisp images and has accurate color rendering. It’s also ideal to have a system that will support multiple screens for when you’re back in your main work space. Lastly, I always advise users to either plug in their laptops or adjust the power settings for high performance since many notebooks default to power-saving features when they’re running on battery which can impact performance. You may have to accept a shorter battery life, but it will ensure faster processing for a great editing experience." </p>
<p> Six ways to speed up your editing life </p>
<p> Hugely experienced edit trainer and colourist, Darren Mostyn, guides us through some essential steps to accelerate editing routines in a bid to make your workflow even more efficient. </p>
<p> I have been editing for over 25 years and thought I would share some of my best tips on how to speed up your editing skills. Most of this advice applies to any editing application. Even a 1% or 2% increase in speed could improve your productivity by over half an hour a week. That’s time you can take off and enjoy or add to the workload and increase your income. Having worked in broadcast sport and live events editing for around a decade, I had to edit super-fast to turn highlights of live action around in some crazy tight deadlines. </p>
<p> Before we get in to the steps, here’s something to keep in mind. Editing quickly is not necessarily why we are employed. But by being quick at the mechanical process of editing also leaves more time for the ‘real’ job – crafting the story, supporting the performances, controlling the pace and engaging the audience, etc. </p>
<p> Learn your keyboard shortcuts. My first piece of advice is to know your keyboard shortcuts inside out. Any menu that you use more than twice a day will likely have a keyboard shortcut or can be mapped to a keyboard. Just take the time to find the shortcut and practise using it. You may find this slows you down to start with, but it will increase your speed over time. Force yourself to use the shortcuts. Combine that with using a dedicated colour coded keyboard available for most NLEs by third party keyboard manufacturers. DaVinci Resolve users like myself can use a dedicated keyboard called the Speed Editor (ed: Other popular video editing applications are likely to have bespoke consoles as well). Don’t forget that you can change shortcuts if you need to – I spent many years alternating between Avid, Final Cut Pro 7 and Adobe Premiere, so now when I edit I have a set of shortcuts that are a hybrid. How flexible you can be will depend on your NLE. </p>
<p> Get training. Invest in some quality training. Whilst this may seem like an expensive outlay, the return on investment can be rewarding. Spending hours looking at YouTube channels hoping that the information is correct can be a potential waste of your time. A structured course will give you more confidence in playing with new techniques – you may find you have been working in a certain way for years only to discover there is a much easier and quicker approach available. </p>
<p> Time management. Your mind will be far more productive if you take breaks. It is believed that 2-3 hours of concentrated work, followed by a short break, is far more effective than 4 or 5 hours straight editing. Get all the emails and social media checks done in the break, but actually take a break from your screen too. Go for a walk or something active, then carry on working for a few more hours - it is good for your body not to be sat in a chair for hours on end. You’ll come back with higher levels of concentration. Be comfortable – this applies to everything. Nothing slows you down more than a bad back or an aching wrist. Invest in a good ergonomic chair or even a standing desk and make sure your monitors are at the right height. </p>
<p> Cheap media is a false economy Use faster hard drives and quality card readers if you are responsible for transferring data. Cheap hard drives and card readers will slow down your transfer speeds considerably. I invested in a decent USB hub after years of using cheap ones and the transfer times are lightning quick. If you can get your data onto SSD drives, you will save so much time over regular drives. Editing and rendering times will also benefit from faster hard drives. You can consider making proxy files from your footage to help with workflow bottlenecks you may encounter on slower machines.If we are making proxies for use in an Avid workflow, we use DaVinci Resolve to generate them as it is quicker. </p>
<p> Use a decent computer. Learn your NLE’s proxy workflow if your computer is struggling. Two monitors or an Ultrawide monitor will help you organise your edit and a third monitor for previewing full screen is ideal. Nothing is more frustrating than being slowed down by the hardware. (ed: The jury is still out on screen resolution) </p>
<p> Freshen up your human interface. A Wacom digitizing tablet and pen will not only speed up your editing but also reduce fatigue in your wrist. I have not used a mouse since discovering Wacom tablets around 20 years ago. I have a small portable size tablet that I can take on the road with me if I am working away from the studio. I currently use an Intuos 3, which is old now, but they are built so well that it still works like new. The fact that I can keep the pen in my hand at all times makes it faster for me to work. Once you have set them up correctly for your comfort and assigned shortcuts to the keys, you will never need a mouse again. If you have to draw any masks or audio levels, it is far easier to use the pen. It takes a bit of getting used to and will slow you down at the start, but you will soon gain speed. </p>

<p> Chinese scientists claim breakthrough in quantum computing race </p>
<p> The breakthrough represents a quantum computational advantage, also known as quantum supremacy, in which no traditional computer can perform the same task in a reasonable amount of time and is unlikely to be overturned by algorithmic or hardware improvements, according to the research. </p>

<p> Chinese scientists claim to have built a quantum computer that is able to perform certain computations nearly 100 trillion times faster than the world’s most advanced supercomputer, representing the first milestone in the country’s efforts to develop the technology. </p>
<p> The researchers have built a quantum computer prototype that is able to detect up to 76 photons through Gaussian boson sampling, a standard simulation algorithm, the state-run Xinhua news agency said, citing research published in Science magazine. That’s exponentially faster than existing supercomputers. </p>
<p> While still in its infancy, quantum computing is seen as the key to radically improving the processing speed and power of computers, enabling them to simulate large systems and drive advances in physics, chemistry and other fields. Chinese researchers are competing against major U.S. corporations from Alphabet Inc.’s Google to Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. for a lead in the technology, which has become yet another front in the U.S.-China tech race. </p>
<p> Google said last year it has built a computer that could perform a computation in 200 seconds that would take the fastest supercomputers about 10,000 years, reaching quantum supremacy. The Chinese researchers claim their new prototype is able to process 10 billion times faster than Google’s prototype, according to the Xinhua report. </p>
<p> Xi Jinping’s government is building a $10 billion National Laboratory for Quantum Information Sciences as part of a big push in the field. In the U.S., the Trump administration provided $1 billion in funding to research into artificial intelligence and quantum information earlier this year and has sought to take credit for Google’s 2019 breakthrough. </p>

Step 2: Then, set scanning range for the selected disk from 3 ranges and click “Next”. If you haven’t created a new partition after partition loss, you can try choosing Unallocated Space since it costs less time. Otherwise, choose Full Disk. Step 3: Next, set scanning method for the selected scanning range and click “Next”. You can try choosing Quick Scan at first because it requires much less time. If this method fails to find needed partition(s), go back to this interface again and choose Full Scan. Step 4: Once partitions MiniTool Partition Wizard detects are listed, please check all useful partitions, both existing and lost/deleted, because unchecked partitions will be lost. And click the “Finish” button. Step 5: After finishing the partition recovery, there is one thing you should do. And that is to select the recovered system reserved partition and set it active. </p>
<p> At last, click the “Apply” button to make all changes finally performed. </p>
<p> After recovering system partition, you should be able to boot Windows again. </p>
<p> Windows can’t boot after deleting system partition? Now, try above methods to recover deleted system partition, repair EFI partition/system reserved partition or reinstall Windows to fix unbootable Windows 10 if it can’t boot after you accidentally deleted system reserved partition or EFI boot partition. </p>

<p> Why Clone Hard Drive </p>
<p> Today it’s a very common requirement for most Windows users to clone a hard drive to another one. As for the reasons, most of them want to copy hard drive to a larger one due to insufficient disk space, some of them want to clone hard drive to SSD for higher efficiency, and some just clone hard drive in Windows 7/8/10 for data backup. No matter what the reason is, it is an indisputable fact that cloning hard drive is now a public demand. </p>
<p> In many cases, users do hard drive clone by using the simplest way copy & paste, which is not a safe method and is time-consuming. Obviously, clone is a better choice than copy & paste. To explain why, we should refer to the difference between copy and clone. </p>
<p> Difference between Clone and Copy </p>
<p> So what’s the difference between clone and copy? Copy means to make a same version, while clone means more. Clone not only guarantees the files are the same, but also guarantees the same physical location as they are in the source disk. In some cases, a file requires fixed and specified location for normal operation. Once the file is moved, it won’t work anymore. So generally speaking, clone is a safer way to replicate data. </p>
<p> How to Clone a Hard Drive </p>
<p> 1.Best Program to Clone/Copy a Hard Drive </p>
<p> In fact, disk cloning can be easily solved by using professional partition magic, and the best one is the one that works for you. So there is no unique answer to the question which partition magic is the best disk cloning software. Usually, free and reliable software is always the first choice. So here MiniTool Partition Wizard is strongly recommended to you. </p>
<p> MiniTool Partition Wizard free edition is a piece of windows clone software helps you to copy hard drive to another without data loss. Actually, for MiniTool Partition Wizard, disk copy equals to disk clone, and it even provides Sector-by-Sector copy technology. So you don’t need to worry about the accident mentioned in the previous content after cloning a hard drive. Besides, this partition magic can be employed on Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10, both 32 bit and 64 bit. </p>
<p> Note: Sector-by-Sector Copy means to copy all sectors of the source disk to the target disk no matter the sector is used or not. </p>
<p> 2.Preparatory work </p>
<p> Make sure the target disk is successfully connected to the same computer; </p>
<p> Make sure the storage space of the target disk is large enough to hold all the data in the source disk; </p>
<p> Make sure the data on the target disk have been backed up because all of them will be destroyed. </p>

<p> Step 3: In this page, four options are provided for you to customize the disk clone. </p>
<p> Fit partitions to entire disk: automatically adjust the partition size to occupy the entire space of the target disk; </p>
<p> Copy partitions without resize: only works when the target disk is larger than the source disk and will clone HDD Sector-by-Sector. </p>
<p> Force to align partitions on this disk: this will improve the performance for Advanced Format disk & SSD. </p>
<p> Use GUID Partition Table for the target disk: by checking this hard drives larger than 2TB can be made full use of. </p>
<p> Also, you can edit each partition on the target disk to adjust the partition size during the process. Then click “Next” to go on. </p>
<p> Step 4: Copy Disk Wizard will tell you how to boot from the destination disk. If you are cloning the system disk, you should pay more attention. After that, click “Finish” to go back to the main interface. </p>
<p> Step 5: Here you can preview the changes you are going to make to the target disk. After confirmation, press “Apply” to make all the changes effective. </p>
<p> That’s all for Windows disk clone. In addition, you can also clone a partition by employing “Copy Partition Wizard“. After you have finished the clone, you can also resize/move/delete partition with free MiniTool Partition Wizard, which is indeed amazing freeware. </p>

<p> For backing up data, there’s no shortage of alternatives to choose from. Few, however, are as simple and straightforward as simply cloning your hard drive. If you need to copy all of your data, or want to safeguard against a corrupted or physically damaged hard drive, having a functional copy of the drive you can immediately turn to is hard to beat. And unlike some backup strategies, which require regular attention or convoluted tools, cloning a drive is a relatively uncomplicated affair </p>
<p> Tools and Utilities For those who want to clone their drive directly, there are several tools available. Among the many backup utilities we’ve reviewed, our top pick is MiniTool partition wizard. </p>
<p> MiniTool Partition Wizard free edition is a piece of windows clone software helps you to copy hard drive to another without data loss. Actually, for MiniTool Partition Wizard, disk copy equals to disk clone, and it even provides Sector-by-Sector copy technology. So you don’t need to worry about the accident mentioned in the previous content after cloning a hard drive. Besides, this partition magic can be employed on Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10, both 32 bit and 64 bit. </p>
<p> Destination Drive Cloning a drive, or even saving a backup image, requires having someplace to save your data to. When backing up an entire drive, you’ll want to have a drive of equal or larger capacity set aside for backup, and nothing else. You have to real options: A bare hard drive, or an external drive. </p>
<p> A bare drive is exactly like the drive you already have in your laptop or desktop—it’s the actual drive, but not yet installed in a machine. Once you’ve acquired the drive, you can either install it as a second drive or purchase a compatible drive enclosure for it. These drives come in several physical sizes, meant for desktops or laptops, and both spinning hard drives and solid-state drives (SSD) are viable options. For cloning purposes, you’ll want a drive with at least as much memory as the data you’re cloning (the amount of used memory in the original drive). For example, if you only have 200GB of data stored on a 500GB drive, some cloning tools will let you clone the data to a drive smaller than 500GB, so long as there is space for all 200GB of data. For a drive that can literally be swapped for the one already in your PC, you’ll definitely want to get a drive that is the same size and connector type as the original. </p>
<p> The other option is to buy an external hard drive. These are self-contained drives, usually connected through a USB connection. External drives may be larger deskbound drives or pocket-sized portables, but they generally all will work as a suitable backup medium, and many will also offer additional features, such as encryption or automated backup software. For a detailed look at desktop and portable drives. </p>
<p> Clean Up Your Files With both a backup utility and a drive to back up to, you’re ready to clone your drive, but this is also a good opportunity to do some digital spring cleaning. There’s plenty of data you want to back up, but chances are you also have plenty of stuff saved—drivers for old devices, programs that aren’t needed, media files you couldn’t care less about—that doesn’t need to be duplicated. For a great guide to getting your drive in tip top shape so that you aren’t cloning a disorganized mess. </p>
<p> Making the Clone Once you’ve got your back up drive, cleaned up the digital detritus, and figured out your backup utility, it’s time to start cloning. Connect the destination drive, open up your backup utility, and follow the utility’s directions to copy the contents of your hard drive to the backup. Depending on the size of the drive to be cloned, the amount of data stored on the drive, and the speed of both the original and backup drives, this process may take anywhere from several minutes to several hours. </p>
<p> Caring for Clones Once the drive is completely cloned you’re done—for now. What you have is an exact copy of the original at that moment in time. Any future changes in files, programs, or anything else will only be reflected on the original drive. Once you swap it for the clone, it will be like stepping back in time to the day you cloned the drive originally. For more up to date backup, you’ll want to schedule time to make a fresh clone at regular intervals—even if it’s just an annual copy for World Backup Day (every March 31st). </p>
<p> You also want to keep that cloned drive somewhere safe and accessible. For long term storage you’ll want to be especially careful to keep the drive safe from moisture, extremes in temperature, and static electricity or powerful magnets. A safe bet is to slip the drive into an anti-static bag and then store it the same way you would vital documents—in a safe or fire box. If you’re less concerned with immediate accessibility, you might also consider storing the drive off-site so that you have a backup to turn to in the event of fire, flood, or similar disaster. </p>

<p> A Brief Introduction to Virtual Machine of VMware Workstation </p>
<p> VMware Workstation is a program which makes it possible for users to set up one or more virtual machines on a single physical machine or run multiple operating systems simultaneously. A virtual machine is an emulation of a particular computer system and operates based on the computer architecture and functions of a real or hypothetical computer. Each virtual machine works separately and functions like a real machine. If we want to run virtual machine successfully, specialized hardware, software, and system should be involved. Well then, how can we set up a virtual machine? </p>
<p> How to Create a Virtual Machine on VMware Workstation </p>
<p> After the ISO file of operating system has been downloaded and VMware Workstation has been installed, users need to run Workstation to get its startup interface like this: </p>
<p> In the window above, users need to choose “Create a New Virtual Machine”. Then, choose a type of configuration and click “Next>” to get the interface below: </p>
<p> Now you can install guest operating system either from installer disc, or from installer disc image file (ISO). Of course, you can also choose to install it latter. And here we select the second one since there is no drives available: click “Browse…” to select the downloaded ISO file from physical machine, click “Next>”, and select a guest operating system (the system you want to install for virtual machine). Next, name the virtual machine and appoint it with a location on physical machine. After these steps, we need to set hard disk capacity (a virtual hard disk can function like a physical hard disk, so it can be used to save different kinds of files, too): </p>
<p> The maximum disk size will be set to be smaller by default (may be 60GB), but we can change it by typing the exact value. However, some users may click “Next>” directly to continue rather than reset a new hard disk capacity. As a result, they get a very small hard disk which may be out of space after a period of time. Under this situation, users badly need to increase hard disk capacity of the virtual machine. Well then, how to add or enlarge hard disk for virtual machine on VMware Workstation? We will introduce detailed steps after the problem how to create virtual machine is solved. </p>
<p> Once the hard disk capacity is set, we need to configure hardware for this virtual machine. We can either click “Finish” to employ default hardware configuration or customize it, which depends on our own demands. After that, the virtual machine we are creating appears in VMware Workstation: </p>
<p> Then, click on “Power on this virtual machine”, and the system installation interface will appear in a short time. At this time, install OS on virtual machine like install system on physical disk. However, if the installation interface does not emerge, we need to power off the virtual machine, then choose “CD/DVD” under “Devices” menu, and next select the ISO file under the “Use ISO image file” option from physical machine. </p>
<p> Once the installation is completed, we can use the virtual machine normally. But what if the hard disk was set too small when we were creating virtual machine? Next, let’s see the specific solution, and here we just take Windows OS for example. </p>
<p> How to Increase Hard Disk Capacity in Virtual Machine </p>
<p> It’s amazing that users can increase hard disk space for virtual machines without adding or replacing physical hard disks, and it can be completed from the GUI (Graphical User Interface) of VMware Workstation. Next we will introduce 2 simple solutions. </p>
<p> 1.Add a New Virtual Hard Disk for Virtual Machine </p>
<p> On one virtual machine, we can configure it with multiple hard disks to increase storage capacity, and detailed steps are as follows. </p>
<p> Open the VMware Workstation and open a virtual machine from the physical hard disk to get the following window: </p>
<p> Then choose “Hard Disk” under the “Devices” item since we need to add hard disk rather than any other hardware component. </p>
<p> In the screenshot above we need to click “Add…” button, and then click “Next>” to continue. </p>
<p> Here we can create a new virtual hard disk by using space from 3 places: create a new virtual disk directly, use an existing virtual disk, and use a physical disk. Here, we choose the first one and click “Next>”. Then, select a disk type for the new disk, which can be either IDE or SCSI. </p>
<p> In the interface above we can set capacity for the new virtual hard disk according to our demands, and here we set it to be 500GB. Tip: some versions of VMware Workstation rule that the disk capacity cannot be larger than 2048GB (2TB). Then, click “Next>”, “Finish”, and “OK” button to apply all previous changes. Finally, we can view the new hard disk: </p>
<p> The 500GB disk is the added one, and it functions like a physical hard disk, too. At this time, as long as we open the virtual machine and initialize the new disk to either MBR or GPT in Disk Management utility, we can use it to save data. Actually, apart from adding new hard disk, we can enlarge the existing disk to increase storage space. Let’s see the specific operations. </p>
<p> 2.Enlarge the Size of Existing Hard Disk in Virtual Machine </p>
<p> Since we will also operate hard disk in this solution, choosing “Hard Disk” under “Devices” is needed. Select it and we can see the following window: </p>
<p> This time we need to select “Expand…” from the drop-down menu of “Utilities” rather than choose “Add…”. However, after making such a choice, you may receive the following error: </p>
<p> That is because there is a snapshot which contains the hard disk you want to expand. To fix this error, we can either remove the snapshot or use VMware vCenter Converter as the error message suggests, but here we just take deleting snapshot for example since this requires relatively simple operations. After successful expanding, you can make a snapshot for the virtual machine. </p>
<p> To remove snapshot, we need to click “VM” from the toolbar, then select “Snapshot”, and next choose “Snapshot Manager” to open the snapshot manager below: </p>
<p> Here, all snapshots you have made are displayed. Please select and delete all snapshots which contain the hard disk we want to extend. After that, we can click “Expand…” to enlarge the hard disk: </p>
<p> Now we can type desired hard disk size in “Maximum disk size (GB)” to enlarge the target disk. And once we click “Expand” button, all changes will be made automatically. Then, we can see the enlarged hard disk: </p>
<p> Now the hard disk capacity has been increased to 500GB from the original 350GB. </p>
<p> Actually, there is still another way to increase hard disk capacity, and it is to make use of the command prompt tool, but this way requires complex operations and professional knowledge so that we are easy to make mistakes. Therefore, VMware highly suggests making a backup for the virtual machine before increasing the size of hard disk, and we do not recommend it. For more information about this solution, please see Increasing the size of a virtual disk of VMware. </p>
<p> Tip: to expand hard disk from GUI is feasible for VMware Workstation 7 and later versions. To do the expanding in older versions of Workstation, you may need to make use of command prompt. </p>
<p> However, though the entire hard disk has been enlarged, there is no increase to the capacity of the disk partitions inside the guest operating system, and the added space is just located at the end of the hard disk and exists as the form of unallocated space. So how can we make use of the expanded hard disk space in virtual machine? There are 2 choices: one is to create a new partition, and the pother is to extend an existing partition to it. </p>
<p> How to Make Use of the Increased Hard Disk Space in Virtual Machine </p>
<p> To use this space, we need to open the corresponding virtual machine, and then enter Windows snap-in Disk Management utility. If you do not know how to enter this program, please see how do I open partition manager. Then we can see the unallocated space: </p>
<p> It is very easy to create a new partition in unallocated space. Just right click the space, choose “New Simple Volume”, and set properties like partition size, file system and allocation unit size (also called cluster size) for this partition. Nevertheless, most of the time we are more inclined to extend an existing partition to the increased space rather than create new partitions since existing partitions (especially the partition C) are easy to run out of disk space. Next, let’s see how to extend a partition. </p>
<p> How to Enlarge Hard Disk Partition of Virtual Machine </p>
<p> If your virtual machine is running Windows Vista or more recent Windows operating systems like Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012, try extending partition in Disk Management, because these operating systems provide the function “Extend Volume”. Nevertheless, there are 2 big limitations in this function: it cannot extend a partition to non-adjacent unallocated space; the partition we want to extend should be formatted with NTFS or RAW. In other words, the increased space can only be added to the last partition. Therefore, we had better look for other ways to extend partitions of virtual hard disk. Next, we will introduce 2 methods. </p>
<p> 1.Convert Basic disk to Dynamic Disk: If you want to do the extending without using a third party program, the only lossless solution is to convert the basic disk to dynamic disk since a dynamic volume can contain discontiguous space. You can do this in Disk Management: right click the basic disk and choose “Convert to Dynamic Disk”. But disappointingly, it does not work to system partition and boot partition, because space for this kind of partitions is required to be contiguous. Therefore, third party partitioning tool is requisite. </p>
<p> 2.Use a Third Party Program: actually, there is free partitioning software that can help enlarge hard disk partition in virtual machine wherever the unallocated space is located and whatever the partition file system is, and using such a this kind of software can simplify operations and enhance data security. Here, we take the freeware MiniTool Partition Wizard for example. </p>
<p> How to Enlarge Hard Disk Partition of Virtual Machine in MiniTool Partition Wizard </p>
<p> Firstly, please download and install the freeware to virtual machine. Of course, you can download it in physical machine and then transfer it to virtual machine if VMware Tools has been installed. If you are running Windows non-server operating systems like Windows 7 and Windows 8, download the free edition. However, if you are running Windows Server, please purchase the Server or more advanced editions. After successful installation, please launch the free partitioning tool to get its main interface: </p>
<p> In this interface MiniTool Partition Wizard shows us all recognized hard disks and partitions, and users need to select the partition which needs extending and choose “Extend Partition” feature from the left pane. Here, we take enlarging partition C by taking space from the unallocated space which is located after partition F for example. </p>
<p> Then, select the unallocated space under the drop-down menu of “Take Free Space from:” and drag the sliding handle to decide how much space to take from the unallocated space. Next, click “OK” to go back to the main interface below: </p>
<p> Now we can see partition C has been extended to be 255.6GB from the original 24.26GB. At this time, we only need to click “Apply” button on the top to make this change applied. </p>
<p> Tip: since partition C saves Windows which is running now, MiniTool Partition Wizard may ask users to restart computer in the process of applying operations. At this time, please do as the program tells, because this is to protect data. </p>
<p> Actually, apart from enlarging hard disk partition in virtual machine, MiniTool Partition Wizard is capable of doing lots of other partitioning operations, like rebuild MBR, wipe disk/partition to avoid privacy leakage, copy disk, convert partition file system from FAT to NTFS (vice versa), merge partition, change cluster size, recover lost partition, etc. Try using it to manage your disks and partitions in virtual machine of VMware Workstation. </p>
<p> One day you may find the once-fast computer is now running very slow just like a tortoise, and this is undoubtedly much troublesome or even makes you crazy. Well, do you know what causes this to happen? Most people blame on hardware (like RAM, CPU, and hard disk), which might be the exact reason, but actually there are many other factors that can generate the issue. Next, 11 possible reasons will be introduced. With knowing the exact reason, users can solve the problem with ease. Of course, not all reasons are covered here, and this post just introduces those we have found so far. </p>
<p> Note: this post just focuses on Windows platform and does not provide solutions for Mac users. </p>
<p> 8 Logical Factors That Can Make Your Computer Run Slow </p>
<p> Firstly, let’s talk about logical faults since the slow performance issue caused by these factors can be solved without users costing money. </p>
<p> Reasons 1: Your Computer Has Been Running for a Long Time without a Reboot </p>
<p> After a long-time running, your computer may generate lots of junk files, like caches and random access memory (RAM), which makes it harder for operating system to locate needed files. However, rebooting may clear all or a part of such files so as to speed up your computer. In addition, rebooting makes it possible to detect Windows update or software update. With the latest version of system or program, our computer is always running smoothly. </p>
<p> Tip: this solution is not suggested for server users. After all, server needs to work all the time. In addition, cold reboot is recommended only when everything fails, because this kind of boot may make hard disk or other hardware corrupted. To reboot a computer, users had better go to Start, click the triangle which is after the Shut down option , and choose Restart (in Windows 7). </p>
<p> However, if you reboot computer regularly rather than run it for a very lone time, the slow performance issue would be caused by other factors. Now please check the second reason. </p>
<p> Reason 2: Boot Partition Is in Low Disk Space </p>
<p> Some users may be unclear of the concept – Boot Partition. Actually, from Microsoft we know it is the partition where Windows is installed. If you install more than one operating system, there will be more than one boot partition. When this partition is running in low disk space like this: </p>
<p> Windows will cost much more time to locate needed files or programs, and at the same time there will be no enough space for swap files and temporary files. Thus, our computer runs slow. </p>
<p> You could also relate to this problem : “C drive (System partition) running out of space” To deal with this issue, users had better enlarge the boot partition rather than reparation hard disk during reinstallation. Well then, how can we extend a partition without losing data? Firstly, you can try doing it in Windows snap-in Disk Management utility (take Windows 7 for example): right click the Computer icon on desktop, choose Manage, select Disk Management, and right click the boot partition to see whether the Extend Volume feature is available: </p>
<p> If the function can be chosen, extend the selected partition by following instructions. However, if it is grayed out, third party partitioning program is recommended. For freeware, just try using MiniTool Partition Wizard since this program is capable of enlarging a partition by taking free space from any other place on the same hard disk and brings no damage to data. For detailed steps, please see Extend Partition. </p>
<p> Of course, you can also delete unnecessary files such as never used programs, temporary files, and cache files to release space, but space got via this method is always limited, and needed files might be deleted by mistake. Once files used to boot Windows are deleted, your system would crash. Therefore, to extend boot partition is highly recommended. </p>
<p> However, if your boot partition is full of free space, the problem might be caused by the following issue. </p>
<p> Reason 3: There Are Many Startup Programs </p>
<p> With lots of startup apps, our computer will take a long time to boot since all these programs need time to start. In addition, most programs will continue to run after the computer starts successfully, which may eat up our RAM or other resources so as to make the computer run with great efforts. </p>
<p> Of course, you can shut down programs which are not frequently used but hogging resources (from the lower right corner of the screen or from Windows Task Bar Manager) to free up RAM each time Windows boots successfully, but this is troublesome. And the best way is to disable unnecessary startup items thoroughly. Pease take the following operations to do the job: go to Start menu, then type msconfig in the Search box, and run this program as administrator to get the following window: </p>
<p> Under the Startup tab, all startup items will be listed. You can manually deselect those you do not want to run during startup. Of course, you can also Disable all, and then select those you want to launch. </p>
<p> However, if the computer still runs slow after disabling unnecessary startup programs, please see the fourth possible factor. </p>
<p> Reason 4: Running Multiple Programs Which Are Hogging RAM </p>
<p> Nowadays, users pay more and more attention to data security. In order to furthest prevent their private or important data from being attacked by virus or malware, they often install more than one anti-virus software or anti-malware. Nevertheless, this kind of program is always taking up lots of memory especially when they are working or updating. If you have doubts about this judgment, please open your Windows Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc or Ctrl + Alt + Delete) to see how much CPU and RAM these programs take up when they are working. </p>
<p> Actually, there is no need to run multiple anti-virus programs at the same time, because most of them work with the same principle. Please try closing extra apps to see whether the low computer issue is fixed. If this also does not work, there might be fragments on your hard disk. </p>
<p> Reason 5: There Are Lots of Fragments on Hard Drive </p>
<p> If users store and delete data on hard disk frequently, fragments are easy to emerge. If the disk is with a lot of fragments, it will do much extra work to seek data, which definitely slows the speed of our computer. </p>
<p> Under this situation, the best solution is to defrag the disk, which is the process of making fragmented data saved continuously, and users can try using Windows Disk Defragmenter to do the job: click Start button, type disk defragmenter in the search box, press on Enter, and run this program as administrator. Then, choose the needed drive (partition) to defrag. For details, please see our previous post Defrag Hard Drive. </p>
<p> But if this is also not the culprit for your slow performance issue, the computer might be suffering from virus infection. </p>
<p> Reason 6: Your Computer Is Attacked by Virus or Malware </p>
<p> Our computer might be attacked by virus or malware even if anti-virus and anti-malware have been installed. There are 2 possible reasons: we forgot to start the program; new virus hasn’t been added to virus database. Attacked by virus or malware, the computer is always running slow or even crashes. Therefore, it is very necessary to run a full virus or malware scan if your computer runs slow after you visited a unknown website. </p>
<p> Reason 7: Partitions Are Misaligned (Especially for SSD) </p>
<p> If you are running Windows on a solid state drive (SSD), take this factor into consideration when your computer is running with great efforts. In general, running system on SSD will be much faster compared with running it on mechanical hard disk (HDD), so lots of people who are seeking for speed have upgraded their system disk to SSD. But this should be on the base that partitions (specially boot partition) are aligned correctly. If users operate partitions on SSD frequently or partitions on SSD come from other disk via copy, they may become misaligned. With unaligned partitions, the computer will cost much more time to boot Windows and access data. </p>
<p> Well then, how to check whether our partitions are aligned or not? With the help of MiniTool Partition Wizard, you can do it with ease. Launch the program and we can see the following interface: </p>
<p> Here, please select the solid state drive and choose “Align All Partition”. Then, the program will detect and show how many partitions to align. At this time, please confirm the operation and click “Apply” button. Afterwards, MiniTool Partition Wizard will align partitions automatically, which brings no data loss. </p>
<p> If all solutions above fail to speed up your computer, most probably Windows is out of date </p>
<p> Reason 8: Your Windows OS Is too Old </p>
<p> Any program should be updated timely to add new functions or fix bugs. When an operating system is out of date, lots of problems like slow computer issue may come. At this time, it is highly suggested that users reset computer to its factory settings or reinstall Windows, and detailed steps can be found from the internet. </p>
<p> However, both reset and reinstallation may lead to data loss. If there are files you need, please backup them in advance. To backup data saved in one partition, try using the “Copy Partition” feature in MiniTool Partition Wizard. To make a copy for data stored on the whole hard disk, make use of the function “Copy Disk”. Both of them will help you save much time. </p>
<p> These are all logical factors and solutions we found. If none of them works for your situation, you may need to think about hardware issues. </p>
<p> 3 Hardware Issues That Can Slow down Your Computer </p>
<p> 1.Not Enough RAM RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of storage for computer systems and comes with the computer. Generally, the more programs you run, the more RAM you need. With enough memory, you are able to access data at a very fast speed. However, if the RAM of your computer just meets a software’s minimum requirement, the computer is very like to run slower and slower until crashes frequently. Therefore, when your computer slows down every time you are running or processing large files, you can try adding more memory for your computer, and this may make your computer faster again. </p>
<p> Tip: different computers may require different types of RAM, and some computers have reached the maximum amount of memory. Therefore, users had better consult professionals before purchasing. 2.CPU Is Aging or with Poor Performance CPU, which is short for Central Processing Unit, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The better performance CPU has, the faster your computer runs. Therefore, when CPU of a computer has been used for a long time or is with poor performance, try replacing the old one. However, a good CPU is always quite expensive for common people. </p>
<p> 3.Hard Disk Is Either Logically or Physically Damaged </p>
<p> When there is something wrong with the hard disk (especially the disk installing Windows), our computer may run like a snail or even cannot start. Well, how can we know whether a disk is logically damaged or physically damaged? Actually, under such circumstances, disk check might be performed automatically during the process of startup. If the check can’t pass, hard disk might be seriously damaged, and users need to replace it. In addition, even if the check passes in the end, their computer would run quite slow and even crash. </p>
<p> To fix this problem, users can try using Windows built-in command CHKDSK at first. Take Windows 7 for example: click Start menu, type chkdsk, and run it as administrator. Then, chkdsk.exe will check disk and fix errors automatically: </p>
<p> However, if this does not work, users need to make use of professional third party utility like Easy Disk Drive Repair to fix the disk. When both solutions are proved to be useless, they may need to replace current hard disk, which is definitely the last solution. </p>
<p> Now all possible factors that can slow down your computer have been listed, and corresponding solutions are also shown. If you are troubled by slow computer performance issues, find the exact reason by referring to possible reasons we give, and then feel safe to try our solutions. It brings no damage to both data and system. </p>
<p> Tip: you’d better check logical errors at first, because you can fix this kind of errors without costing money. Only when logical errors have been excluded, take hardware issues into consideration. After all, users should pay for new hardware devices.

<p> Tech: Microsoft vs Google trial raises issues over secrecy </p>
<p> Google and Microsoft, like rivals embroiled in smartphone patent wars, are eager to keep sensitive business information under wraps - in this case, the royalty deals they cut with other companies on patented technology. Microsoft asked for similar protections in a court filing late on Thursday. </p>
<p> Such royalty rates, though, are the central issue in this trial, which begins November 13 in Seattle. </p>
<p> U.S. District Judge James Robart has granted requests to block many pre-trial legal briefs from public view. Though he warned he may get tougher on the issue, the nature of the case raises the possibility that even his final decision might include redacted, or blacked-out, sections. </p>
<p> Legal experts are increasingly troubled by the level of secrecy that has become commonplace in intellectual property cases where overburdened judges often pay scant attention to the issue. </p>
<p> Widespread sealing of documents infringes on the basic American legal principle that court should be public, says law professor, Dennis Crouch, and encourages companies to use a costly, tax-payer funded resource to resolve their disputes. </p>
<p> "There are plenty of cases that have settled because one party didn't want their information public," said Crouch, an intellectual property professor at University of Missouri School of Law. </p>
<p> Tech companies counter that they should not be forced to reveal private business information as the price for having their day in court. </p>
<p> The law does permit confidential information to be kept from public view in some circumstances, though companies must show the disclosure would be harmful. </p>
<p> Google argues that revelations about licensing negotiations would give competitors "additional leverage and bargaining power and would lead to an unfair advantage." </p>
<p> Robart has not yet ruled on Google and Microsoft's requests, which, in the case of Google includes not only keeping documents under seal, but also clearing the courtroom during crucial testimony. </p>
<p> It is also unclear whether Robart will redact any discussion of royalty rates in his final opinion. The judge, who will decide this part of the case without a jury, did not respond to requests for comment. </p>
<p> NOT PAYING ATTENTION </p>
<p> Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp have been litigating in courts around the world against Google Inc and partners like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, which use the Android operating system on their mobile devices. </p>
<p> Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS smartphone software, and Microsoft holds patents that it contends cover a number of Android features. </p>
<p> Google bought Motorola for $12.5 billion, partly to use its large portfolio of communications patents as a bargaining chip against its competitors. </p>
<p> Robart will decide how big a royalty Motorola deserves from Microsoft for a license on some Motorola wireless and video patents. </p>
<p> Apple, for its part, is set to square off against Motorola on Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, in a case that involves many of the same issues. </p>
<p> In Wisconsin, Apple and Motorola have filed most court documents entirely under seal. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb did not require them to seek advance permission to file them secretly, nor did she mandate that the companies make redacted copies available for the public. </p>
<p> Judges have broad discretion in granting requests to seal documents. The legal standard for such requests can be high, but in cases where both sides want the proceedings to be secret, judges have little incentive to thoroughly review secrecy requests. </p>
<p> In Apple's Northern California litigation against Samsung, both parties also sought to keep many documents under seal. After Reuters challenged those secrecy requests, on grounds it wanted to report financial details, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ordered both companies to disclose a range of information they considered secret - including profit margins on individual products - but not licensing deals. Apple and Samsung are appealing the disclosure order. </p>
<p> In response to questions from Reuters last week, Judge Crabb in Wisconsin, who will also decide the case without a jury, acknowledged she had not been paying attention to how many documents were being filed under seal. Federal judges in Madison will now require that parties file redacted briefs, she said, though as of Wednesday, Apple and Motorola were still filing key briefs entirely under seal. </p>
<p> "Just because there is a seed or kernel of confidential information doesn't mean an entire 25-page brief should be sealed," said Bernard Chao, an intellectual property professor at University of Denver Sturm College of Law. </p>
<p> Crabb promised that the upcoming trial would be open. </p>
<p> "Whatever opinion I make is not going to be redacted," she told Reuters in an interview. </p>
<p> CHECKING THE COMPS </p>
<p> Microsoft sued Motorola two years ago, saying Motorola had promised to license its so-called "standards essential" patents at a fair rate, in exchange for the technology being adopted as a norm industrywide. But by demanding roughly $4 billion a year in revenue, Microsoft says Motorola broke its promise. </p>
<p> Robart will sort out what a reasonable royalty for those standards patents should be, partly by reviewing deals Motorola struck with other companies such as IBM and Research in Motion - much like an appraiser checking comparable properties to figure out whether a home is priced right. </p>
<p> In this case, though, the public may not be able to understand exactly what figures Robart is comparing. Representatives for Microsoft and Google declined to comment. </p>
<p> In its brief, Microsoft said licensing terms could be sealed without the need to clear the courtroom. </p>
<p> "Permitting redaction of this information will minimize the harm to Microsoft and third parties while also giving due consideration to the public policies favoring disclosure," the company argued. </p>
<p> IBM and RIM have also asked Robart to keep licensing information secret. </p>
<p> Chao doesn't think Robart will ultimately redact his own ruling, even though it may include discussion of the specific royalty rates. "I can't imagine that," he said. </p>
<p> Most judges cite lack of resources and overflowing dockets as the reason why they don't scrutinize secrecy requests more closely, especially when both parties support them. </p>
<p> In Wisconsin, Crabb said that even though she will now require litigants to ask permission to file secret documents, it is highly unlikely that she will actually read those arguments - unless someone else flags a problem. </p>
<p> "We're paddling madly to stay afloat," Crabb said. </p>
<p> The Wisconsin case in U.S. District Court, Western District of Wisconsin is Apple Inc. vs. Motorola Mobility Inc., 11-cv-178. The Seattle case in U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc., 10-cv-1823. </p>

<p> Tech: Microsoft Tests Smartphone With Asia Suppliers </p>
<p> TAIPEI—Microsoft house. is functioning with element suppliers in Asia to check its own smartphone style, folks at home with the case aforesaid, suggesting the computer-software large is more and more adopting a variation of a business model favored by rival Apple INC., that styles computers and phones along side the computer code that powers them. </p>
<p> Officials at some of Microsoft's parts suppliers, who declined to be named, said the Redmond, Wash.-based company is testing a smartphone design but isn't sure if a product will go into mass production. </p>
<p> One person said that the screen of Microsoft's smartphone currently being tested measures between four and five inches. Apple's newest smartphone, the iPhone 5, has a four-inch screen, while Samsung's Galaxy S III phone has a 4.8-inch screen. </p>
<p> Speculation has swirled for months that Microsoft would make its own smartphone, after Microsoft unveiled in June its first homegrown computing device, the Surface tablet. The Surface went on sale last week, and it remains controversial among longtime Microsoft allies, some of whom believe the company is unfairly competing with their personal-computer models running Microsoft's Windows software. </p>
<p> In an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Monday, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer declined to comment on whether Microsoft would make its own smartphone. </p>
<p> "We're quite happy this holiday [season] going to market hard with Nokia, Samsung and HTC," said Mr. Ballmer, referring to companies making smartphones powered by Microsoft software. "Whether we had a plan to do something different or we didn't have a plan I wouldn't comment in any dimension." </p>
<p> A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment. </p>
<p> If Microsoft pushes ahead with its mobile phone, it would underscore how far Microsoft has moved away from its long-standing practice of making software and leaving decisions about design, features and marketing of the computing hardware to partners such as Hewlett-Packard Co. or Samsung Electronics Co. </p>
<p> In addition to the Surface, Microsoft produces the Xbox videogame consoles and it increasingly has dictated how Windows-powered PCs and smartphones made by its partners look, perform and are pitched to consumers. </p>
<p> As it does so, Microsoft pulls from a modified playbook of Apple—whose hardware-plus-software approach Microsoft officials long have scorned. Google Inc., whose Android smartphone software is the market-share leader, owns cellphone maker Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. even as outside companies such as Samsung also power their smartphones with Android. </p>
<p> Smartphones running Microsoft's two-year-old Windows Phone operating software for cellphones haven't sold well, and Microsoft may want to leave itself an option to test whether its own phone would spur sales. </p>
<p> Stephen Elop, the chief executive of Nokia Corp., two weeks ago on a conference call said he would welcome a Microsoft-made phone because he believed it would be a "stimulant" to sales for all companies making Windows Phone devices. In the conference call with analysts, Mr. Elop said he wasn't informed about Microsoft's plans. </p>
<p> The market for smartphones is rapidly expanding with demand particularly strong in China and other emerging markets. Research firm IDC expects global smartphone shipments to grow 38.8% this year to 686 million units. </p>
<p> In 2010, Microsoft launched and then quickly killed a line of youth-oriented smartphones called the Kin. The phones carried Microsoft's brand, but were manufactured by Japanese electronics company Sharp Corp. </p>
<p> News about Microsoft working on its own smartphone was reported earlier by several technology blogs. </p>

<p> General Motors India today launched the CNG version of its Chevrolet Aveo mid-size sedan at a ceremony presided over by its President and Managing Director Mr. Karl Slym. The Aveo CNG is a bi-fuel vehicle with a full-size petrol tank that is one of the most environmentally friendly cars available in India. </p>
<p> Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Slym said, “The launch of the Aveo CNG is a testament to the importance that GM India attaches to green technology and environmentally friendly mobility solutions. Its running cost is approximately 57 percent lower than a similar vehicle powered by petrol and 25 percent lower than a similar vehicle powered by diesel. Because of the lower operating economics and the growing number of CNG stations being built across India, this new offering is expected to appeal to both individual and fleet customers. Under normal driving conditions, the Aveo CNG has a range of 180 to 200 kilometres on a full tank of CNG and is BS IV compliant.” </p>
<p> The Chevrolet Aveo CNG is equipped with next-generation computer-controlled CNG injection technology from Italy. In an industry first, all “critical to quality” CNG kit components are fitted at the factory – including the CNG injectors, selector switch, modified wiring and suspension – to ensure high-quality and trouble-free service. In addition, the body is reinforced to carry the additional mass of the cylinder. Sequential injection represents the most advanced level of evolution of CNG kit technology. The ECU (Electronic Controller Unit) calculates the opening times of the injectors for each cylinder and acts separately on each gas injector with the highest precision. </p>
<p> Aveo CNG Benefits include: 1. The sequential injection kit offers precise fuel delivery control through electronic injectors, ensuring efficient combustion. 2. The engine offers stable performance in CNG mode. 3. The Aveo has a CNG-compatible engine. Hardened valve seats and anodized pistons are used in the proven 1.4-litre VGIS (Variable Geometry Intake System) petrol engine. This ensures no engine damage or reliability issues in CNG mode. 4. Minimum service is required owing to the Aveo CNG’s advanced electronic operation. 5. The suspension has been reinforced to support the additional mass of the CNG cylinder in the trunk. </p>
<p> GM India engineers have done extensive testing and validation of the Aveo CNG. The Chevrolet Aveo CNG comes with a three-year/100,000-km standard warranty, which is an industry first in the mid-size sedan segment, and a service interval of 5,000 km or six months (whichever comes first). During the run of the Aveo in pure CNG mode will not impact the vehicle warranty. </p>
<p> It may be recalled that the Chevrolet Aveo finished first in its segment in the prestigious J.D. Power Initial Quality Study (IQS) two years in a row because of its class-leading quality attributes. It has also been rated best in class in terms of fuel economy by journalists across the country. In addition, the Aveo has won several awards since its introduction. </p>
<p> The Chevrolet Aveo is a global product that incorporates the latest technology and meets the highest standards of quality. It has been re-engineered for India based on extensive testing across the country to meet the specific needs of local customers, driving conditions and regulations. Its class-leading performance and long list of features make it an ideal city car. The Aveo is being sold in more than 140 countries around the world, including several European markets and the United States. </p>

<p> Home Mobile News iPhone SE RAM same as iPhone 13! BIG upgrade from 2020 model </p>
<p> iPhone SE RAM same as iPhone 13! BIG upgrade from 2020 model </p>
<p> iPhone SE 3 RAM details have emerged after the launch. The new iPhone SE has same RAM as iPhone 13. </p>
<p> iPhone SE 2022 has got the same amount of RAM as iPhone 13! In a recent revelation from Apple’s Xcode release, it is confirmed that the new iPhone SE shares more than just the iPhone 13’s chipset. While the phone’s design has barely changed from the original iPhone SE, Apple has updated the internal specifications to keep up with the modern features. Hence, similar to the iPhone 13, the new iPhone SE 2022 has got 4GB RAM. </p>
<p> This is a notable upgrade from the 3GB RAM available on the iPhone SE 2020. Not that the outgoing iPhone SE 4G was in desperate need of more RAM, considering all of the demanding apps and games still run with ease on the A13 Bionic chip. Given that the new iPhone SE gets those software features from the iPhone 13, such as the Photographic Styles and Deep Fusion tech for the camera, the extra RAM could help with these. Additionally, it can also help with the longevity factor. </p>
<p> iPhone SE has more RAM </p>
<p> Other than the enhanced RAM, the iPhone SE also gets the more capable A15 Bionic chip from the iPhone 13. The A15 not only brings faster performance to the mix but also enables support for 5G connectivity. Apple says it has upgraded the glass used on the iPhone SE to make it more durable. Plus, battery life is also said to be improved with the new model, with Apple claiming a 0-50 percent charge in 30 minutes with the 20W Apple adapter. </p>
<p> However, the rest of the phone remains unchanged from the iPhone SE 2020 model. Hence, you get the same 4.7-inch LCD display surrounded by retro fat bezels and the Home button, which holds the Touch ID fingerprint scanner. The iPhone SE still does not get the Face ID system from the modern iPhone models. </p>
<p> The front and rear cameras also remain unchanged, with Apple using the same 12MP single rear camera it first debuted on the iPhone 8. There is no ultra-wide camera like on the iPhone 13. The IP67 water and dust resistance certification also remains on the new iPhone SE. </p>
<p> Starting at Rs. 43,900 for the 64GB model, the new iPhone SE is easily the most affordable 5G iPhone you can buy at the moment. However, you can expect the prices to drop over the next few months. </p>

<p> Hong Kong x Journalism </p>
<p> Is new technology or new media changing the nature or role of international news? </p>
<p> In 2006, the prophecy of the end of printed press already existed. The Economist sums up its grim future in one sentence: Who Killed Newspaper? International news has evolved sweepingly over the years, and people are blending in with different avant-garde media platforms unconsciously. From Starbucks’ and McDonald’s, pavements to anywhere humans belong, people can instantly receive news happening across the continent simply swiping their phone screen. As an old-school person, you probably still fancy skimming mushy words on a rustic newspaper. Unfortunately, legacy media will soon stop flowing through your veins. Where do technology and new media fit in in this internet-dominated age? In what way does it change the role and nature of news? </p>
<p> Firstly, there has been the trend of new media and technology directing people access news via mobile phones in recent years. According to Knight Foundation (2016), nearly 90 percent of the American population (144 million people) accesses news information through phones. Likewise, mobile news readership outstripped that of computer news with an escalation of 50% from 2014 to 2017. One of the features that keep mobile news seekers hooking is the rapid news updates on phones, leading by the push notification function that notifies users without the need to open the news app. Another feature is that mobile news apps are able to provide custom content. In addition, mobile news can help readers absorb succinct information but maintain a level of in-depthness in the meantime. Apart from swiping through the phone screen for trending news posts, mobile phones also offer voice search, which is an instant interaction with the news. The adaptive nature of mobile news might explain why users prioritize it over other mediums such as computers and print. </p>
<p> Another shifting nature of international news is social media as the major gatekeeper to news information, as opposed to the role once played by printed press and broadcast news. As pointed out by Newman, Fletcher, Kalogeropoulos, Levy, and Nielsen (2017), 51% of the American news seekers use social media as a source of news. Editors and journalists of legacy media can no longer decide what news should go to the public on the first hand, nor can they control what news should be trending at the moment. In contrast, a social media site like Twitter can list a news topic as trending when the channel detects growth in tweets about a particular matter. In May 2013, Twitter turned Boston Marathon Bombing into the number one trending news topic. Within the first few hours after the incident occurred, its breaking news had already been tweeted for more than 150 times. The bombing incident remained as the hottest news topic on the platform for a few days, with news posts evolving from a bomb investigation to the later lockdown of the Boston city. Traditional media simply cannot compete with the astonishing speed of social media in spreading news information. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, the changing landscape of international news being gatekept by social media has led to the questionable objectivity of news reporting. Due to the high liquidity of social media and the emergence of big data, a plenty of perspectives can be offered in the context of a single news reporting. As a result, truth and fiction intermingle with each other. In 2018, the Wall Street Journal used simple average rate data to show that America’s tariffs are not only in Australia but also Canada, Japan, and EU countries. However, the picture changes if new agencies focus on weighted average rate data. Under such calculation, America’s international tariffs are higher than that of Canada, Japan, and many EU countries. Being fast is the key to succeed in the news industry. One of the quickest ways to gain readership is to single out a particular set of data, pay attention to the trendiest topics on social media so as to create attention-grabbing posts. However, neutrality of news content is not sure to have been taken into account. </p>
<p> Furthermore, the rise of multimedia elements in technology and new media has enabled international news to be presented in a more in-depth and interactive way. To achieve so, reporters have to grapple with multiple digital skills ranging from data visualization using coding, Virtual Reality to 360-degree videos. News stories delivered through these mediums tend to be more compelling, realistic and all-rounded. Following, For instance, The New York Times utilizes 3D modeling and timelapse of photos to debunk New York City’s reconstruction in over 11 years in the story titled Reshaping New York. This has shown the audience the picture of urban development in a more sophisticated and detailed manner. The newspaper also features 360-degree videos that give news stories a more personal touch. In Sensations of Sound, the presenter is standing in a room that can be viewed by the audience from a full angle. To highlight her experiences with sound as a deaf person in visual, physical and tactile forms, 360-degree animation and 3D audio effect have been incorporated into the video as well. The new media toolkits mentioned have advanced our way of reading, watching and comprehending the news. </p>
<p> Technology and new media have changed the nature of news in many ways in terms of its presentation. Even though the accuracy of the news gathered through a digital medium is concerning, it is undeniable that digital news medium has benefited us for a more convenient cause. </p>

<p> The best Linux laptops of 2021 have you covered if you’re searching for a Windows 10 or macOS alternative. You don’t have to buy a slow, low-powered machine or install Linux yourself these days to have a laptop with an open-source OS. </p>
<p> In fact, some of the best Linux laptops offer up the same durability and premium design as their Windows counterparts. They’ll also cost less since there’s no Windows 10 license included with the laptop. It also means that you’re not stuck with a proprietary operating system. </p>
<p> While Linux-based machines aren’t as widely offered as Windows and macOS ones, boutique laptop companies are getting in on the action and offering machines pre-installed with Linux. Even Dell, one of the biggest laptop makers out there, offers pre-installed Linux machines. </p>
<p> But, why would you invest in one of the best Linux laptops instead of something else? If you’re not familiar with Linux, it’s an operating system that’s open-source, free, and allows you a large amount of freedom and privacy. In fact, they’re typically more secure than other operating systems. Windows 10, being so popular, is most often the target of viruses, for instance. </p>
<p> Though Linux has a bit of a reputation for being complicated and technical, there are a number of distros (Linux variants), that are ideal for beginners, such as Ubuntu and Mint. And, if you buy a laptop with Linux pre-installed, then getting started is even easier. </p>
<p> With this guide, we’re going to dive into the best laptops that are specifically built for the open-source operating system. There aren’t any mainstream notebook vendors, beyond Dell at least, that offer Linux as a base OS option on a new laptop. This leaves us with other smaller manufacturers, which can carve out a niche for themselves with the best Linux laptops. </p>
<p> Plus, you can still install Linux on pretty much any laptop, even though some manufacturers lock down their products, making installing Linux kind of a pain. There are lots of different Linux desktop environments to choose from, and a whole host of open-source Linux apps available. </p>
<p> We picked out five of the best Linux laptops on the market right now, all of which have been fine-tuned to run some of the best Linux distros (like Ubuntu, for instance). That means they’re guaranteed to run the open-source OS out of the box without any tinkering. </p>
<p> Best Linux laptops 2021 </p>
<p> Reasons to buy </p>
<p> Plenty of connectivity options </p>
<p> Reasons to avoid </p>
<p> - </p>
<p> Limited customizations </p>
<p> The XPS 13 may no longer be the undisputed champion of the Ultrabook market, but it’s still one of the best Ultrabooks out there. And, one can only admire Dell for its unwavering Linux support on a flagship machine, making the Dell XPS 13 7390 one of the best Linux laptops on offer. </p>
<p> The laptop has a number of customizations you can opt for, but as with all Dell products these days the number of configurable options is quite limited. The basic model comes with 8GB of LPDDR3 RAM at 2133 MHz, though this can be upgraded to 16GB RAM for an extra $100. </p>
<p> There are also two main harddrive options, both solid state, offering a capacity of either 256GB or 512GB of storage. There are also two screen option: the more expensive is the 4K (3,840 x 2,160) InfinityEdge touchscreen. Though it’s worth bearing in mind that the higher-res screen will tax the GPU and CPU more, and may affect battery life adversely. The more wallet-friendly configuration runs with a Full HD (1,920 x 1,080) 13.3-inch InfinityEdge non-touch display. </p>
<p> Although the Dell website offers three different style options for the XPS 13 when it comes to Windows, for the Ubuntu edition there's only the single style option of the platinum silver with the black carbon fiber palmrest - which, to be fair, is probably the most stylish option. </p>
<p> 2. System76 Serval WS </p>
<p> Reasons to buy </p>
<p> Up to 64GB system RAM </p>
<p> Reasons to avoid </p>
<p> - </p>
<p> Hefty price </p>
<p> System76's Serval WS is the ultimate laptop powerhouse, not to mention one of the best Linux laptops on the market. Available with a 15-inch or 17-inch display, it offers a range of options from the 9th Gen Intel Core processors typically found in desktop machines. </p>
<p> The Serval WS is highly customizable, with up to 64GB of system RAM and up to 12TB of storage on hand. A variety of Nvidia GeForce RTX GPUs are also on hand, and gamers will further appreciate the choice of either a Full HD or 4K display. </p>
<p> It's obvious that a lot of thought and care has gone into the design of the Serval WS, considering that each key on the keyboard comes with its own multicolor backlight. The laptop, like all System76 models, comes preinstalled with either the firm’s own custom POP!_OS, which is based on Ubuntu, or Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (64-bit). </p>
<p> This notebook also has impressive connectivity in terms of ports, but be aware that this laptop is a fairly hefty beast, with the basic 15-inch model weighing 7.5 lbs (3.4 kg) and the 17-inch version tipping the scales at 8.6 lbs (3.9 kg). </p>
<p> This heftiness is matched only by the weighty price tag - pricing for the basic design model starts from $1,999. </p>
<p> 3. Purism Librem 13 laptop </p>
<p> Reasons to buy </p>
<p> Upgrade option to three-year warranty </p>
<p> Reasons to avoid </p>
<p> - </p>
<p> Rather expensive </p>
<p> Purism embarked on a quest to build the most secure laptop ever, choosing (obviously) Linux distro PureOS to power the device. From that quest came Librem 13, one of the best Linux laptops on offer. </p>
<p> In terms of specifications, Purism comes with seventh generation Intel processors and graphics chips, as well as 8-32 GB of DDR4 RAM. </p>
<p> Purism is the only notebook vendor on the market to offer physical kill switches as standard on its laptops. Instead of going mainstream, the company tapped into the crowdfunding community to gain more than $430,000 (around £300,000, AU$550,000) worth of funding, allowing it to adopt a stricter ethos than most firms when it comes to privacy, rights to free software and security. </p>
<p> The Librem 13 might look and feel like a bog-standard laptop. However, there's far more to it than meets the eye (for example, the company designed its own motherboards). </p>
<p> In addition, Purism’s commitment to Linux (and security in general) certainly goes beyond most of the vendors on this list. </p>
<p> 4. System76 Oryx Pro laptop </p>
<p> Reasons to buy </p>
<p> Nicely configurable </p>
<p> Reasons to avoid </p>
<p> - </p>
<p> Can be very expensive </p>
<p> One of the best Linux laptops to date, the Oryx Pro is definitely built for the operating system. Indeed, it currently offers a choice of either Ubuntu 18.04 or System76’s own Ubuntu-based Pop!_OS on purchase. </p>
<p> The Oryx Pro is made from lightweight aluminium with a matte black finish and is available in two screen sizes, either 16.1 or 17.3 inch. Inside, it's powered by a 9th generation Intel Core i7-9750H, which offers 2.6 to 4.5 GHz as well as a 12 MB cache, and for RAM you can choose up to 64 GB dual-channel DDR4 at 2667MHz, or up to 32 GB dual-channel DDR4 at 3000MHz. </p>
<p> For storage there are two SATA harddrives offering 8TB altogether, and graphics options include the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060, 2070, or 2080. </p>
<p> The Oryx Pro is sleeker and lighter than the Serveal featured above, coming in at 4.6 lbs (2.09 kg) for the 16.1 inch screen version, and at 5.51 lbs (2.50 kg) with the 17.3 inch screen option. </p>
<p> Again, as like the Serval, though, this is an expensive machine, with the base price starting from $1,699. </p>
<p> 5. System76 Galago Pro laptop </p>
<p> Reasons to buy </p>
<p> Matte Full HD display as default </p>
<p> Reasons to avoid </p>
<p> - </p>
<p> A cheaper Full HD version should be offered </p>
<p> The Galago Pro from System76 is the cheapest Linux laptop on this list. Like the other machines from System76, it offers either Pop!_OS or Ubuntu to run on. However, even though it has some decent specifications, even the base model comes in at less than $950. </p>
<p> The standard processor is a 10th gen Intel Core, either the i5-10210U or the i7-10510U. 8 GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM at 2667MHz is also available at start, though this can be expanded to up to 64 GB. Storage options begin with a 240GB SSD, though can be upgraded to a 6TB SATA harddrive. </p>
<p> It's also much sleeker and lighter than the previous System76 models featured here, weighing in at just 2.87 lbs (1.3 kg) for the base model, though any upgrades are likely to raise that. </p>
<p> Altogether, another solid Linux laptop, but at a more affordable price than the others featured on this list. </p>

<p> Sunday, 7 July 2013 </p>
<p> Yet another leaked image of a Motorola device has surfaced thanks to Twitter account @evleaks. This time it is not a Moto X Phone, the subject of so many leaks and rumors this week. Instaed, the device in the render appears to be a Motorola DROID MAXX that @evleaks claims is headed to the Verizon network. The DROID MAXX is expected to be similar to the Motorola DROID ULTRA, if not the same, with the exception being a high capacity battery. </p>
<p> The DROID MAXX is expected to ship as a Kevlar framed device with capacitive buttons. Other than the possible connection to the DROID ULTRA, other specs are not yet known for the device. However, it does appear Verizon has several Motorola devices in the pipeline for release sometime in 2013, with several apparently poised to carry the DROID name. While all manufacturers seem to be more inclined recently to work to ensure their devices are available on all carriers, it seems that Verizon and Motorola are working especially close together to make the latter half of 2013 a season of DROID. </p>
<p> Recently, Electronic Arts launched The Simpsons Tapped Out game in the Amazon Appstore, and they skinned a few Kindle Fires to celebrate. We happen to have one of them thanks to Electronic Arts, and we are giving it away to one of our lucky readers. It’s the 7-incher with 8GB of internal storage. </p>
<p> All you have to do is comment below telling us who your favorite character on the show is. It couldn’t be any easier. You have until Monday, July 8th at 12:00pm EST. We will then select one winner at random. Just make sure the email address in your account is a real one because that is how we are going to contact you. </p>
<p> BTW, if you’re not familiar with The Simpsons Tapped Out game, you need to check it out. It’s actually one of Jack Holt’s favorite games. The game’s premise is that Homer accidentally caused a meltdown wiping out Springfield. It’s a city building game, and you guessed it, you need to help rebuild Springfield. It’s a free download in the Amazon Appstore or the Google Play Store. </p>
<p> We’re only a few days away from seeing how accurate the July 11th prediction for the Moto X is, but that’s not going to stop the leaks from coming. The latest set of pictures show what appears to be the front plate of the Moto X. No internals, but it’s a good shot of the cosmetics of the device, and it matches up with most of the other leaks we’ve seen in the past several weeks. Personally, I think these plates have a more rouned, Nexus-ish aesthetic to them that isn’t seen in Motorola devices, so they could definitely be the result of a Google and Motorola collaboration. Hopefully we don’t have to wait too much longer to find out. Hit the break below to check out some of the pictures. </p>
<p> With more and more privacy problems popping up, especially in portable technology, everyone is paying more attention to what information their phones have access to and how they’re handling it. The latest problem may come from Motorola, as a Droid X2 owner has found out that tons of information is being funneled through Motorola servers from the device. </p>
<p> According to a bit of snooping done by Ben Lincoln, his Droid X2 was sending information about apps, files on his phone, login credentials, and even the types of photos uploaded onto the internet to a Motorola server, which is a scary thought. Although Motorola does claim to get a little invasive in their privacy policies (which absolutely every other company in the world does, too) there’s some concern that Motorola might be extending its reach a bit with user data. </p>
<p> Of course, there’s nothing to suggest this is malicious, and it may not even affect other devices aside from the Droid X2, Regardless, it’s a great reminder that when you’re dealing with the internet, true privacy is hard to get. </p>
<p> A bit of irony for your Saturday night— in a recent customer satisfaction survey carried out by a Korean-language news site, Apple stood atop the standings with a 52% satisfaction rating. The Korea-based Samsung fell a bit short of their main competitor, with a 50% satisfaction rating. LG was able to manage a 46% rating. The poll surveyed over 44,000 smartphone owners, so its definitely a large sample size. The companies were also graded on a point scale, in which Apple managed 711 points, Samsung garnered 695 points, and LG was able to pick up 682 points. </p>
<p> The Astrid task management service, which was purchased by Yahoo! back in May, has officially announced it will be shutting down on August 5th. Through an email to all of their users, the Astrid staff let them know that they have a month to back up all of their data, and gave instructions to head to a special data export page, and make an easy migration to services such as Wrike, Wunderlist, Sandglaz, and Any.do. The Astrid app has become extremely popular, with over 4 million downloads, so there are surely going to be some pretty unhappy people come August 5th. Check out the full email from the Astrid staff after the break. Happy exporting, folks! </p>
<p> Astrid Winding Down </p>
<p> First off, we want to sincerely thank you for being an Astrid user over the years. Your support every step of the way has meant the world to us. As of August 5, 2013, we will be closing the Astrid service. We know that a transition can be tough, but we want to make it as easy as possible for you. Please go to this link: astrid.com/home/export to download your data. Once you have your data, we recommend you check out one of these applications. They will allow you to easily import your data, so you can pick up where you left off: Wrike, Wunderlist, Sandglaz, and Any.do. When we built Astrid, we sought to help as many people as possible become happier, healthier and more productive – and we certainly hope we helped you. Thank you again for your support. </p>
<p> Developers have been getting more and more creative with how they look at widgets, constantly thinking up new functions and designs. A couple months back we told you about a slick new app called Overlays that brings widgets front-and-center no matter what application you are running. An excellent idea, Overlays is only available for Android 4.0 and above. Thanks to XDA Senior Membersak-venom1997, an alternative to Overlays called Widgets Everywhere has been released. </p>
<p> Currently in public beta version 2.32, Widgets Everywhere is a very useful application with some innovative features. Incorporating XDA Senior Member pingpongboss’s StandOut libraries, users are able to float and move widgets over any running application using pinch-to-zoom gestures to resize. Widgets can overlap each other, and users can float as many widgets as they can fit on their screen. </p>
<p> Planned features for the future include a custom widget-picker, independent of Android’s built-in tool and enhanced resizing options. Widgets Everywhere is compatible with any device running Android 2.1 or newer and is ad-free and free to download at the link below. </p>

<p> Apple’s new iPhone 7 has launched – what’s Apple tweaked for the new edition? </p>
<p> Apple has now officially announced the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus; the latest generation of smartphone hardware introduces plenty of new enhancements and updated features, but it still seems that the rumours are true – the firm is holding back the BIG changes for 2017’s model, which will be the 10-year anniversary for the iPhone. Anyway, the important thing is examining what is new on the latest edition, and is it worth considering for an upgrade? </p>
<p> iPhone 6s vs iPhone 7: Major Specs </p>
<p> iPhone 6s </p>
<p> Display: 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch 3D Touch, 1334×750 and 1920×1080 pixel resolutions </p>
<p> Design: Aluminum body with antenna bands on back, Physical Home Key, TouchID </p>
<p> Front Camera: 5MP </p>
<p> Rear Camera: 12MP, 4K video recording </p>
<p> Display: 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch 3D Touch, 1334×750 and 1920×1080 pixel resolutions, wide colour gamut </p>
<p> Design: Aluminium body, antenna bands shifted to top and bottom edging, Capacitive Home key, IP67 waterproofing </p>
<p> Storage: 32GB, 128GB, and 256GB </p>
<p> CPU and RAM: A10 Fusion processor, 3GB RAM </p>
<p> Front Camera: 7MP with wide angle lens </p>
<p> Rear Camera: Dual-lens 12MP – telephoto and wide-angle (for the Plus model), 4K video recording, optical image stabilization, /1.8 aperture, new 6-element lens, new image signal processor, quad-LED flash with flicker sensor </p>
<p> Ports: NO headphone jack, Lightning port </p>
<p> iPhone 6s vs iPhone 7: Design </p>
<p> As expected, visually the iPhone 7 is not massively far removed from the iPhone 6s, however, a key difference is that the antenna bands have been moved to the upper and lower edges, which makes them more discrete. Apple has also done away with the Space Grey colour option and replaced it with “Black” as well as another “Jet Black” colour variant with a gloss finish. The other major changes come in the form of the Home key, which is now a capacitive, touch-sensitive panel rather than a physical button. It features a Haptic feedback engine and can perform a range of software functions, including the Touch ID fingerprint scanner. On top of this, the iPhone 7 series is the first family of iPhones which are fully IP67 water and dust proof, for up to 30 minutes submerged in water. </p>
<p> For some people the ability to drop your iPhone safely in a bath might be reason enough alone to upgrade, but in most other respects the iPhone 7 is very similar to what came before. </p>
<p> iPhone 6s vs iPhone 7: Display </p>
<p> The display technology is not that different on the whole, with the big change over to OLED expected for 2017. Apple has kept the 3D Touch functionality, of course, and has implemented a 25% increase in brightness as well as a wide colour gamut. Other than that it is the same IPS LCD Retina screen we’ve seen before at the same sizes and resolutions. </p>
<p> iPhone 6s vs iPhone 7: Camera </p>
<p> The camera is the BIG change for the iPhone 7 series. The camera aboard the iPhone 7 features a new 6-element lens with a wide f/1.8 aperture to allow in more light; it has a 12MP sensor with optical image stabilisation (OIS), a quad-LED TrueTone flash with built-in flicker sensor (to compensate for artificial light), and a brand new image signal processor (ISP). The iPhone 7 Plus setup builds on this with a pair of 12MP sensors in a dual-camera setup, one with a wide-angle lens and one with a telephoto lens; the result is a setup that has a much higher image quality overall, but can also perform 2x optical zoom and up to 10x software zoom, as well as simulate Bokeh depth-of-field effects. </p>
<p> iPhone 6s vs iPhone: Hardware </p>
<p> As well as being the first waterproof iPhone, the iPhone 7 is also the first with stereo speakers. Apple has also ditched the 3.5mm headphone jack and audio is now handled through the Lightning port (or wirelessly). Inside you’re looking at Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor chip, up from the iPhone 6s A9 chip. The A10 sips about a fifth the amount of battery life compared to the A9, while offering a 40% uplift in CPU and GPU performance. </p>
<p> The iPhone 6s came in 16GB, 64GB and 128GB storage flavours but both those lower tiers are gone in favour of a 32GB base model, a 128GB middle and a 256GB top tier! </p>

<p> Mobile vs. Computer: Implications for News Audiences and Outlets </p>
<p> Share on twitter </p>
<p> Share on linkedin </p>
<p> A new paper by Johanna Dunaway, Joan Shorenstein Fellow (spring 2016) and associate professor of communication at Texas A&M University, examines how mobile technology – despite expanding internet access – is also contributing to a digital divide in news consumption. </p>
<p> By 2020, two-thirds of all online activity is expected to take place on mobile devices. Currently, mobile-only internet access has risen more sharply among Latino, black, and low-income Americans. Dunaway’s research finds, however, that mobile devices are less conducive to the consumption of news than desktop computers for a variety of reasons, including connection speed, smaller screens and variable costs for access. Although news outlets are reaching a wider audience through mobile devices, and there are some dedicated news consumers who spend a significant amount of time using news apps, most mobile users’ encounters with news are incidental and brief. Dunaway argues that this presents a challenge both for the news industry, and for an informed citizenry. </p>

<p> Listen to Dunaway discuss her paper on our Media & Politics Podcast: </p>
<p> Introduction </p>
<p> By 2020, two-thirds of all online activity is expected to take place through mobile networks on mobile devices.[1] Many Americans, including more than half of Latinos, are already mobile-only internet users.[2] The move to mobile is commonly portrayed as expanding the base of internet users. That’s true, but mobile is different.[3] Mobile also means a different pattern of internet use, including the likelihood of seeking news online.[4] Mobile reduces news seeking and engagement. Mobile-only access to news is better than none, but news is more time consuming and costly to access through mobile devices,[5] resulting in reduced exposure. The effect is most severe among those who are otherwise least exposed to news.[6] </p>
<p> In this paper I will explain mobile’s limitations as a means of news consumption and its implications for an informed citizenry. It will be shown that Americans are increasingly abandoning cable in favor of mobile and that news consumption through mobile devices is different from consumption through computers with a high speed connection.[7] The shift to mobile will increase the problem of informing the public, which was already complicated enough as a result of media fragmentation. The knowledge gap between America’s most and least politically interested citizens has widened substantially in the past three decades and will widen further as a result of the move to mobile. </p>
<p> The High-Choice Paradox </p>
<p> News can enrich civic life.[8] There was a time—the heyday of the broadcast networks—when Americans consumed a lot of news, the great bulk of it provided by print and broadcast outlets wedded to the notion that they were obliged to inform the public.[9] Changes in communication technology changed that media system. Cable and the internet have produced an abundance of outlets for those with an interest in news.[10] Some Americans now spend more time consuming news than was possible in earlier times. Even the incremental shift from dial-up to high-speed internet has contributed to increased news seeking among the politically interested.[11] They have become more politically informed and engaged as a result.[12] </p>
<p> Today’s high-choice system has also led to news avoidance by those with less interest in politics. </p>
<p> However, the high-choice media system has also been disruptive.[13] It gives people the opportunity to find like-minded information outlets. Exposure to partisan news serves to reinforce bias.[14] Selectivity—a preference for supportive information and a tendency to dismiss disconfirming information—has long characterized the news audience. But today’s high-choice system heightens that tendency.[15] For those who choose to reside in “echo chambers” that tell them what they want to believe, the effect is opinion polarization that can include outright disdain for “the other side.”[16] </p>
<p> Today’s high-choice system has also led to news avoidance by those with less interest in politics.[17] With media fragmentation has come expanded entertainment options, and most Americans prefer entertainment to news. They still manage some exposure to news. But the amount of time that the average American spends with news has declined over the past three decades while the amount of time they devote to media-based entertainment has sharply increased. A consequence has been a widening knowledge gap between the politically interested and those for whom politics is of passing interest.[18] </p>
<p> The Mobile Revolution </p>
<p> The next big disruption—the shift to mobile—is already well underway. Global tablet sales recently surpassed desk and laptop computer sales. At the same time, broadband subscriptions are declining, with people increasingly shifting to wireless.[19] </p>
<p> Analysts tend to look at mobile through the same two lenses they have applied to cable and the internet. Through an abundance lens, mobile is seen as yet another step in the transition to a high-choice media environment.[20] Mobile means that choices made on cable and the internet can now be made on mobile at any place and time. Through the affordance lens, mobile is seen as expanding the audience for content, particularly in the developing world. [21] Mobile technology extends internet connectivity to millions who would otherwise not have it. </p>
<p> What’s missing in much of this analysis is recognition of the constraints that mobile technology places on how people engage with news content.[22] Research indicates that the mobile is less conducive to news consumption than is a traditional computing platform.[23] It is not a “news friendly” platform.[24] </p>
<p> What’s missing in much of this analysis is recognition of the constraints that mobile technology places on how people engage with news content. </p>
<p> Research by Karen Mossberger and her colleagues found that high speed internet in the home is a leading predictor of whether people engage in online news seeking, whereas mobile internet access is not closely related to such behavior.[25] The smaller screen size of mobile affects user choice and learning.[26] Nipan Maniar and his colleagues showed that subjects learn far less when watching video on a small screen rather than a large one.[27] Small screen size is also negatively correlated with reading time and ease[28] and positively related to time spent scrolling for information.[29] </p>
<p> Slower connection speeds on wireless networks present another hurdle for information seekers. When users have to wait longer than a second or two for content to download, they tend to defect. Four of five users will click away if a video stalls while loading. Slow loading content also diminishes a user’s likelihood of returning to the site.[30] Content providers are investing heavily to shorten load times[31] but wireless is slow in comparison with high-speed internet and will remain so for the foreseeable future.[32] Slow load time tends particularly to curb use by those who don’t regularly consume news.[33] </p>
<p> Mobile also restricts news consumption in other ways. In two different experiments I conducted with Kathleen Searles, Mingxiao Sui, and Newly Paul, we monitored news attention and engagement with eye tracking software. Subjects were randomly assigned to computers, tablets, and smartphones and then shown online news stories.[34] We found that, relative to computer users, mobile users spent less time reading news content and were less likely to notice and follow links and to do so for longer periods of time.[35] </p>
<p> Important tendencies in mobile use can be seen in the comScore data presented in Figures 1 and 2. The first figure shows the average number of minutes that visitors spend on selected major news sites by mode of access—desktop computer, mobile web browser, or mobile app. The second figure shows audience reach by mode of access. </p>
<p> Figure 1: Average Minutes Visitors Spent on News Sites, Access via Desktop, Mobile Browsers, and Mobile Apps </p>
<p> Figure 2: News Site Audience Reach for Desktop, Mobile Browsers, and Apps Estimated Average Number of Website Visitors (in Thousands) </p>
<p> As Figure 1 shows, attention to news is quite high among mobile users who use news apps. In fact, the time spent on sites when accessed by mobile app exceeds the time spent on sites accessed through desktops or mobile web browsers. However, as Figure 2 shows, the mobile news app audience is only a fraction of the desktop or mobile-browser audience. Figure 1 also shows that time spent on sites via desktops is more than double that of the time spent through mobile browsers. Another look at Figure 2 points to a reach vs. engagement tradeoff. Though mobile browser users’ average time on news sites is short – audience reach is greatest through that mode of access. </p>
<p> The reach versus engagement tradeoff is also apparent in the Pew Research Center’s analysis of the top 50 digital news sites. The large majority of the top 50 news sites had higher time rates per visit for desktop than for mobile, whereas the large majority of the top 50 sites had more visitors through mobile than through desktop.[36] </p>
<p> In light of what we know about Americans’ preferences in a high-choice media environment, these findings are predictable. Only those with the highest levels of political interest will implant news apps on their mobile devices. We can expect them to pay substantial attention to mobile-delivered news. Yet, they are relatively few in number. Most mobile users encounter news content through web browsers, much of which is the result of click-based incidental exposure.[37] </p>
<p> Different Connections and Different Audiences </p>
<p> Princeton’s Markus Prior notes that a high-choice media system offers more of everything, entertainment as well as news. During the broadcast era the news monopoly at the dinner hour resulted in a high level of news exposure. News was viewers’ only choice, and many Americans were wedded enough to television to watch it. With the advent of cable in the 1980s, the choices expanded and the flight to entertainment began.[38] </p>
<p> The politically interested are consuming more news than before, and know more about politics than before. The politically uninterested are shying away from news, and know less. </p>
<p> Mobile is a high-choice platform. Audience statistics reveal that news is a relatively small part of the content accessed through mobile, which is contributing to Americans’ widening news and information gaps. The politically interested are consuming more news than before, and know more about politics than before. The politically uninterested are shying away from news, and know less. </p>
<p> These tendencies differ across the American population, and mobile will further widen several already wide demographic divides.[39] According to Pew, the percentage of Latinos with home internet service has dropped while the percentage of Latinos that are mobile dependent has risen sharply. Mobile dependency has also risen more sharply among black Americans than white Americans. At present, roughly one in four Latinos and one in five black Americans are mobile dependent, compared with one in ten white Americans. Income is a strong predictor of the form of internet access, with lower-income Americans having less access to high-speed in-home service[40] and greater dependency on mobile service.[41] Age, too, is in play. Young adults in the broadcast era consumed nearly as much news, and knew nearly as much about politics, as older adults. Today, young adults consume much less and know much less, with further declines to come, given their strong preference for mobile. </p>
<p> Unlike home access, mobile access has a variable cost. It’s based on usage level, which forces the user to make a cost-benefit calculation.[42] For those on a small budget, choices have to be made, and news is almost certain to take a back seat to more pressing or compelling uses. How many mobile dependent users are willing to bear the cost of news? Even in the home, where the cost is constant, the slice of internet traffic dedicated to news is very small relative to that devoted to entertainment, product consumption, and the like.[43] We also know that individuals of lower income generally have less interest in news.[44] When low interest and cost consciousness are combined, the result is predictable. News is a commodity that many mobile users are not willing to pay for. Free in the home is one thing. Paying a higher mobile bill each month to consume a significant amount of news is another, a tradeoff that many Americans acknowledge. Forty-nine percent of Latinos in a Pew survey reported that their lack of broadband access was a barrier to their ability to keep up with the news.[45] </p>
<p> Implications for News, Democracy, and Governing </p>
<p> Access to the internet via mobile devices has changed the way we engage with news, and how often and fully we attend to it—a shift that has affected segments of the American public in different ways. The implications are substantial. </p>
<p> News organizations are seeking to navigate the shift to mobile, recognizing that adjustments in the timing and content of news will affect their ability to attract audience. News organizations are not just thinking about when and how to format and deliver their news, but where screen size, resolution, and connection speed fit in. Even seemingly small differences such as screen orientation have been shown to affect users’ behavior.[46] </p>
<p> The discussion here highlights the need for deeper thinking about specific audiences and the particular constraints they face in the mobile setting. News organizations are aware they must know their audience. But for all news organizations hoping to cultivate and maintain an online audience, the lesson to date is clear: mobile news content must be crafted with the constraints of the mobile environment in mind. Research is only now beginning to emerge that could provide precise guidelines about how to navigate the constraints. Even something as basic as the difference between the app and the browser experience is not yet well understood. Preliminary evidence, including that of our experiments and the comScore data, indicate that important differences exist, but a larger understanding of such differences is needed if news organizations are going to flawlessly navigate the world of mobile. </p>
<p> For all news organizations hoping to cultivate and maintain an online audience, the lesson to date is clear: mobile news content must be crafted with the constraints of the mobile environment in mind. </p>
<p> News organizations face a menu of questions. For text based content, for example, they need to know more about user response to headline and link placement and style and how the arrangement of words and pictures on small and large screens affect user response. And with all such questions, there is the attendant question of whether the response varies depending on whether the user reaches the site through an app or mobile browser. Attracting and retaining audience in the mobile era is already an uphill battle. A better understanding of user behavior is needed if the odds are to be improved. </p>
<p> The move to mobile also raises challenges for democracy. Mobile has been shown to curb news seeking, attention, and engagement, adding to the concern that today’s fragmented media environment is eroding the public’s level of information and engagement. That concern is multiplied by the fact that citizens who are turning to mobile are already among those who are the politically least informed and interested. There is literally nothing in the mobile experience that is likely to convert the less interested and a lot of reason to think that mobile will aggravate the information and engagement problem. It may be correct to conclude, as some already have, that we are entering an era of second-class digital citizenship led by a mobile-only digital underclass.[47] </p>
<p> A conceivable result is a widening disconnect between those who are politically interested and informed and those who are not. Given that this disconnect falls along income, racial, ethnic, and occupational lines, the effect could be an acceleration of the divide between America’s haves and have-nots—this at a time when that divide is already a source of political concern and unrest. </p>
<p> Any such development would have governing implications. Mobile has other governing implications as well. It could create pressure to reduce government funding for public access computers and could slow the effort to extend broadband connections in rural areas and poorer urban neighborhoods and rural areas.[48] It’s already the case that some schools are requiring students to have tablets rather than laptops, undoubtedly in a well-meaning effort to respond to student interest while saving money. But schools need to recognize that such a policy is not simply a question of platform substitution. It will change students’ behavior, including their inclination to access news content. </p>
<p> In short, the shift to mobile has broader consequences than are typically acknowledged. To be sure, from a public interest perspective, access to the internet through mobile is better than no access at all. But the massive shift from computer to mobile that’s underway will create disruptions for news organizations and present new challenges to democracy and government. Major technological changes rarely enter society without altering it, and mobile is unlikely to be one of the rare exceptions. </p>

I am so fortunate to have been part of a wonderful class of fellows that included Joanna Jolly, Dan Kennedy, and Marilyn Thompson. I enjoyed learning so much from each of them, through their work on their papers and during our many informal conversations at Orinoco and other favorite spots. It is another added bonus that our fellows’ class overlapped with Bob Schieffer’s time as a Walter Shorenstein Media and Democracy Fellow. It is always an honor to meet someone long admired, it’s even better when that person is a pure delight. I could not have asked for a better group of fellows with whom to overlap. </p>
<p> I’m also grateful to have learned so much just by being “in the room” at the Shorenstein Center; it’s hard not to learn from people like Tom Patterson, Matt Baum, Marion Just, Robert Picard, Michael Ignatieff, Nancy Palmer, Katie Miles and Richard Parker just by being around a table with them. Tom and Matt have been especially helpful, sharing their time or advice even beyond reading drafts and giving comments during our fellows’ luncheons. I also benefited enormously from the series of wonderful speakers who came through the Center during my time here. I’ve never had so many occasions to learn about news and politics in such a concentrated period of time. It has been nothing short of a blast. </p>
<p> I am also extremely grateful to Katie Miles, Nancy Palmer, and Tim Bailey for all their help, planning and guidance, all of whom have been enormously patient and generous with their time. I know my “fellow” fellows feel similarly – this is a well-run operation and our experiences have been so much smoother for their efforts. This is especially true of Katie, who seems to have the patience of Job and a clear knack for anticipating how to help. I also owe thanks to the rest of faculty and staff at Shorenstein for providing such a warm and welcoming environment. Thanks especially to Lisa, Brandon, Kristina, Denise and Nilagia for your smiles and friendliness throughout the term. I want offer special thanks my research assistant, Sisi Tang, who is the perfect blend of responsiveness, efficiency, and calm. The project really benefitted from Sisi’s assistance and I look forward to seeing where she lands after her time at the Kennedy School. </p>
<p> Last spring I was honored and thrilled to receive a fellowship offer from the Shorenstein Center. My semester here exceeded those high expectations. I’ll always be thankful for everything I’ve gained, professionally and personally, while at the Shorenstein Center. </p>
<p> I’d also like to thank my collaborators on three related projects: Kathleen Searles, Stuart Soroka, Mingxiao Sui, and Newly Paul. </p>

<p> While the Obama administration faces heat for avoiding customary process, Mikanen has several ardent defenders who have spoken out since his name surfaced a few days ago. One is Kirke Kickingbird, a lawyer and former professor at Oklahoma City University. In The Oklahoman today (Wednesday, February 9), Chickasaw Nation Lt. Gov. Jefferson Keel called Mikkanen “an outstanding attorney” who has “the background and experience” for the trial judge post. </p>
<p> Like many of his other defenders, Keel acknowledged there may have been what reporter Chris Casteel called “a breach of protocol” in the nomination. Lael Echo-Hawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation who is president of the National Native American Bar Association, also stated strong support for the nominee. Many observers note that there are no “enrolled Indians” (registered tribal members) serving on the federal bench. </p>
<p> Webber, who works at Ryan Whaley Coldiron Shandy, an Oklahoma City law firm, is passionate in support of Mikkanen, who worked under his supervision for three years in the 1990s. Webber was U.S. Attorney for two years in Oklahoma City. He delivered a strong defense of Mikannen in an interview with CapitolBeatOK. He said: </p>
<p> “I don’t see how anyone could question Arvo’s qualifications for the federal bench. He has a distinguished 25-year career as an Oklahoma lawyer. He started by clerking for two different federal judges. He worked in private practice at a well-known Oklahoma firm. He has represented the United States in both civil and criminal cases. In fact, Arvo has been an advocate in over 475 federal court cases. He has been recognized by the Oklahoma Bar Association for his ‘pro bono’ service and by the FBI for his prosecutorial skills — not many lawyers can say that. </p>
<p> “I personally worked with Arvo for seven years. … He was known throughout the Justice Department as an expert on federal criminal jurisdiction in Indian Country. He helped develop a memorandum of understanding between law enforcement and state, tribal, and federal government officials regarding the investigation of child abuse crimes in order to hold abuser accountable. He also started our district’s use of specially trained forensic interviewers and pediatricians in the process of interviewing preteen victims of sexual abuse. This process was designed to help obtain reliable testimony without further traumatizing the child. Arvo prosecuted some of the hardest cases brought to our office. Arvo prosecuted fairly and played by the rules.” </p>
<p> Like other observers, Webber acknowledges Mikkanen’s nomination was advanced outside of customary procedures. Webber, who worked for former U.S. Sen. David Boren, also a Democrat, took strong issue with assertions that Mikkanen is not qualified for the post. He told CapitolBeatOK: </p>
<p> “I know of no reason Arvo’s qualifications could be legitimately questioned. In fact, his qualifications are very much like those of another Oklahoman nominated to an even higher court, Tenth Circuit Judge Jerome Holmes. I also worked with Judge Holmes for seven years. He too served as a law clerk for two different federal judges, worked as a federal prosecutor, and practiced in a prestigious Oklahoma City law firm. Governor [Brad] Henry and I both wrote letters in support of the Holmes nomination and Senator Coburn put both letters in the Congressional Record the day Judge Holmes was confirmed. Now, however, Arvo is called unacceptable by the Senator within hours of his nomination? Arvo arguably has even stronger qualifications in one respect. He has actually been a judge, both at the trial level and at the appellate level, in tribal courts throughout Oklahoma.” </p>
<p> Incidentally, here are a list of opinions Mr. Mikkanen wrote while a tribal judge: </p>
<p> Mustang Fuel Corp. v. Cheyenne-Arapaho Tax Comm’n, 4 Okla. Trib. 1, 1994 WL 1047927, Cheyenne-Arapaho, January 3, 1994 (No. CNA-SC-91-02) </p>

<p> Taliban targeting Afghanistan’s crucial power, IT infrastructure </p>
<p> The Afghan IT sector, one of the few success stories from the war-ravaged nation, now threatened by continued conflict. </p>
<p> Kabul, Afghanistan – When 30-year-old Ali Atayee enrolled for his first computer lessons as an Afghan refugee child growing up in Iran, he knew then this is what he would like to pursue as a career in his adult life. </p>
<p> When he returned to Afghanistan in the years that followed, with that one goal in mind, Atayee directed all his energy, time and resources to learning computer science, particularly web development. </p>
<p> A graduate of Kabul’s prestigious American University of Afghanistan, Atayee has worked with many growing Information Technology (IT) businesses and development projects in the small, yet thriving IT sector in the country. </p>
<p> Over the last couple of years, Atayee has moved to working as a freelance web developer for local companies. </p>
<p> “I had a passion for computer programming but also seeing how the situation was improving in Afghanistan back then, I speculated there would be a lot more development and opportunities in the sector by the time I had graduated,” he told Al Jazeera. </p>
<p> As more and more Afghans came online – 12.8 million Afghan internet users as of 2021 – the industry flourished over the last 20 years. </p>
<p> A USAID report in 2012 noted that the telecommunications field had become one of the largest revenue-generating sectors in Afghanistan with an annual average revenue of $139.6m, accounting for more than 12 percent of the total government revenues. </p>
<p> The IT sector in Afghanistan was deemed one of the few success stories of the war-ravaged nation by many experts. </p>
<p> “It was one industry where the public and private sector have been able to build a partnership to provide services to Afghans, while generating revenues for the government and private companies,” Mohammad Najeeb Azizi, former chairman of Afghanistan Telecom Regulatory Authority (ATRA), told Al Jazeera. </p>
<p> However, this potential is quickly ebbing away as the conflict in Afghanistan worsens, with the United States-led forces leaving the country and Taliban regaining a foothold in a nation it once ruled with an iron fist. </p>
<p> As the Taliban makes sweeping gains across the country in the last two months, Afghanistan’s IT and other basic infrastructure have come under frequent attack. </p>
<p> On July 5, Taliban fighters blew up fibre optic devices and system equipment in Herat province’s Islam Qala, a border city with Iran and an important trading port. </p>
<p> Islam Qala is also a migrant crossing where a number of international NGOs operate, working with thousands of deported refugees daily. </p>
<p> The Taliban attack has left the residents in the city without internet connectivity. </p>
<p> Last month, the ATRA reported that 28 telecommunication antennas were destroyed across the country in the last three months, while another 23 were partially damaged due to the ongoing conflict, seriously affecting digital and mobile communication services in the country. </p>
<p> Simultaneously, the impoverished nation’s electricity infrastructure was also taken out, making the power supply extremely erratic even in capital Kabul. </p>
<p> “In the last six months, 39 electricity pylons that bring imported power into Afghanistan have been damaged,” Sangar Niazi, the spokesman of Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS), the country’s national power supplier, told Al Jazeera. </p>
<p> Afghanistan imports nearly 70 percent of the 1,600 megawatts of its electricity needs from neighbouring countries through these pylons. </p>
<p> “Some were completely destroyed while others were partially damaged, affecting power supply to Kunduz, Baghlan, Kabul, Nangarhar and Parwan provinces,” Niazi said. </p>
<p> While Niazi did not share who the attackers were, the Afghan government has frequently blamed the Taliban for the infrastructural destruction. </p>
<p> Millions of Afghans have become intimately familiar with regular power cuts and being forced to navigate daily tasks and chores with just a few hours of electricity supply. </p>
<p> However, the lack of electricity has badly hit the country’s small IT sector, particularly for young professionals like Atayee. </p>
<p> “People in Kabul get only a few hours of electricity per day, some not even an hour, which is only enough to charge your devices and it gets cut again,” he said to highlight the challenges of delivering work amid the power and internet cuts. </p>
<p> As a freelance web developer, Atayee has struggled to meet deadlines on his ongoing project. </p>
<p> “I have barely been able to get any work done lately, and all my tasks are piling up. The other day, my laptop charger got fired due to the unstable electric currents. It not only slows down my work, but also creates a problem for the clients who are trying to launch a website for their new business,” he told Al Jazeera. </p>
<p> “If I don’t deliver on time, I lose clients.” </p>
<p> Atayee said a lack of proper infrastructure has also discouraged Afghan businesses from going online. </p>
<p> “They are hesitant to bring their business online or use technology to their advantage. It impacts both the customers and the professionals in the field,” he said. </p>
<p> “We are so behind in the use of technology compared to other countries. We should have at least had online payment capability by now.” </p>
<p> Many businesses in Kabul’s IT sector have bought large power generators and invested in proper electricity backup to ensure continued supply. But the costs eat into their profits. </p>
<p> For smaller businesses and freelancers such as Atayee, it also means the opportunities of work that previously seemed abundant are no longer lucrative. </p>
<p> “When the infrastructure is not ideal, business won’t invest in the online space. As a result, there are fewer tech-related jobs. So many people who study this as a major are working in other fields,” he said. </p>
<p> Afghanistan’s business experts warn that if the conflict continues at the same pace, the additional infrastructure costs and risks will discourage new investments. </p>
<p> “When warring factions shut down services, it affects the revenue generation of these companies and makes it difficult for them to justify the costs. It could lead to a decision to proactively shut down sites or reduce investment on its upkeep, depriving locals of these essential services,” ATRA ex-chairman Azizi said. </p>
<p> It is not only the private businesses affected financially by the Taliban attacks on IT and electricity infrastructure. DABS spokesman Niazi told Al Jazeera the cost of repairing the power pylons has been mounting, putting pressure on the government treasury. </p>
<p> “If one pylon is completed destroyed, it costs around $100,000 to get it back up. Other smaller damages incur costs anywhere between $500 to $5,000,” he said, adding that Afghanistan’s national electric company has spent close to $1m only in the last six months. </p>
<p> According to Azizi, it is the regular citizens who are most affected by the infrastructure damages. </p>
<p> “Afghans use communication services not only to improve their lives but to remain in contact with their loved ones in such critical times,” he said. </p>
<p> “Telecom is a public service infrastructure and a basic need of the Afghan public.” </p>
<p> Azizi appealed to the fighting factions to “protect essential services which are not only used by ordinary citizens but also by the warring parties”. </p>
<p> Niazi said the Taliban attackers were the “enemies of light”, who are turning an essential infrastructure into another casualty of war. </p>
<p> “It is an attempt to not only push the country into physical darkness, but also intellectual darkness.” </p>

<p> Toshiba shuts the lid on laptops after 35 years </p>
<p> The Japanese giant Toshiba has sold its final stake in the personal computer maker Dynabook. </p>
<p> It means the firm no longer has a connection with making PCs or laptops. </p>
<p> Sharp bought 80% of Toshiba's personal computing arm in 2018 for $36m (£27m), and has now bought the remaining shares, Toshiba said in a statement. </p>
<p> Toshiba's first laptop, the T1100, launched in 1985. It weighed 4kg (8.8 pounds) and worked with 3.5 inch (8.8cm) floppy disks. </p>
<p> In 2016, it had ceased making consumer laptops for the European market, focusing only on hardware for businesses. </p>
<p> That same year its president and vice-president resigned after an independent panel found the company had overstated its profits for the previous six years. </p>
<p> Consumer demand for laptops has soared in the last few months because of the Coronavirus pandemic and global lockdowns, but overall, the market for personal computers has been tough for quite a while, said analyst Marina Koytcheva from the firm CCS Insight. </p>
<p> "Only those who have managed to sustain scale and price (like Lenovo), or have a premium brand (like Apple) have succeeded in the unforgiving PC market, where volumes have been falling for years," she said. </p>

<p> I know that some people are extremely excited about the imminent release of Windows Vista, Microsoft's latest OS offering. But does Microsoft really need to spurn that excitement? Despite the fact that Vista is hardly more than an XP facelift, it hasn't stopped the mega-corp from unveiling the "Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate Limited Numbered Signature Edition." Yes, you too could own the tongue-twising piece of disastrous history by purchasing one of 20, 000 copies of Vista Ultimate, complete with a unique serial number, and an embossed signature from none other than Bill Gates. </p>
<p> In a world of competing high-definition formats, it looks like corporations are finally beginning to see the light. At CES this year, consumer electronics giant LG announced the first commercially available dual-format player, capable of playing both HD-DVD and Blu-ray discs. Of course, the product has been public for close to two weeks now, but American electronics store Best Buy are now showing that the player is in stock despite a scheduled release date of February 4th. Nevertheless, the store apparently has the items already, with an attached price tag of US$1200. </p>
<p> For potential late-comers to the console market, bad news is on the horizon. According to Sony, a significant reduction in the cost of the PS3 is a long way off, if it will come at all. Despite market expectations that Sony's Playstation 3 will see similar cost depreciation to the Playstation 2, an interview with SCEA CEO Jack Tretton reveals otherwise. </p>
<p> Nano-technology research by IBM scientists could put equivalent of 30,000 movies on single iPod. </p>
<p> Scientists at IBM have managed to manoeuvre single atoms in such a way that could create building blocks for ultra-tiny storage devices and herald the dawn of new hard disks with massive amounts of storage. </p>
<p> Understanding and manipulating the behaviour of atoms is critical to harnessing the power of nanotechnology, which deals with particles tens of thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. </p>
<p> "One of the most basic properties that every atom has is that it behaves like a little magnet," says Cyrus Hirjibehedin, a scientist at IBM's Almaden Research Center. "If you can keep that magnetic orientation stable over time, then you can use that to store information. That is how your hard drive works." </p>
<p> "What we are trying to understand is how this fundamental property works for a single atom." </p>
<p> Hirjibehedin and colleague Andreas Heinrich studied this property, known as magnetic anisotropy, in individual iron atoms using a special microscope developed at IBM. </p>
<p> "What we've been able to do is to look at an iron atom on a copper surface and to move that magnetic orientation around," Heinrich says. </p>
<p> Now they are looking for an atom that remains stable over a long time. "We have a couple of ideas but we don't really know which ones will work out," Hirjibehedin claims. "In the very long run, we're shooting for data storage on a very tiny scale." </p>
<p> In a separate, but equally important development, IBM scientists in Switzerland have stumbled on a way to manipulate molecules to switch on and off, a basic function needed in computer logic. The scientists had been evaluating the vibration of a molecule when they noticed it had distinct switching capabilities. </p>
<p> Heinrich, who is familiar with the work, claims the discovery is especially important because the switching action does not alter the framework of the molecule. Molecular switches could be used to store information and would lead to super-fast, super-tiny computer chips. </p>
<p> The two discoveries, which were published in the journal Science, will one day form the basis of future devices that IBM scientists were reluctant to even speculate about. </p>
<p> "Put yourself in the situation of people in the '70s, where they had a roomful of computing equipment that could basically do what you can do nowadays on your cell phone," Heinrich says. "They would have given you some really stupid answers." </p>
<p> A Department of Health report claims "impressive milestones" for the NHS' £12 billion IT programme. </p>
<p> This year has seen "impressive milestones" for the NHS' £12 billion IT programme, according to a report from the Department of Health (DoH). </p>
<p> In a report forecasting a financial surplus of £983 million across NHS trusts this year, the DoH said the £12 billion National Programme for IT (NPfIT) has reached some impressive milestones. </p>
<p> "The first quarter of this year also saw some impressive milestones in the implementation of the NPfIT," David Flory, director general for NHS Finance, Performance and Operations, wrote in the report. "NPfIT continues to make significant progress in providing robust and speedy infrastructure and systems to enable the NHS locally to be ever more responsive to providing better care for the patients they serve." </p>
<p> In the first quarter of this year, the Picture Archiving and Communications System (PACS), which handles digitised medical images, was fully implemented, with nearly 82 million such images stored in that period alone. </p>
<p> As well, between April and June of this year, eight Patient Administration Systems were rolled out to eight acute departments in hospitals across the country. Over a million appointments were made on the electronic Choose and Book system, while the Electronic Prescription Service now handles 11 per cent of daily prescriptions - over nine million in the first quarter alone. </p>
<p> The report also praised the decentralisation of the upgrade process, saying it has given local bodies more influence on the roll out and implementation of the IT programme. </p>
<p> Aside from praising its IT programme, the DoH report also detailed positive progress in its goal to cut waiting times to 18 weeks and battling inequities in healthcare. </p>

<p> Microsoft just announced that the upcoming Windows 9 will, in fact, be called Windows 10. Crazy days. So let's pull out 10 of the very best new features from Microsoft's upcoming Windows XP killer. Talking about the new name, Terry Myerson - executive vice president of Microsoft's Operating Systems Group - said that the Windows 9 name "wouldn't be right" given the new One Microsoft internal strategy. Hence the move to Windows 10. The Windows 10 release date is slated for "mid-next year" as we previously estimated. There was no confirmation as per the rumour that Windows 9 might end up being free. Starting tomorrow Microsoft will start distributing a Technical Preview build of Windows 10 via the Windows Insider Program. YouTube : Belfiore says phones are a "natural step forward" - so expect to see Windows Phone 10 debut in 2015. A Consumer Preview will be coming "early next year" - we reckon it will coincide with CES 2015. Microsoft says it will have more for developers at its Build 2015 conference in April when it will talk more about universal apps. That almost certainly means Windows 10 won't be launched in April. The current build of the new OS is Windows Technical Preview 9841 and is currently at a very early stage. Previously codenamed Threshold, there is currently no Internet Explorer or consumer features like a media player. </p>
<p> 1. There's loads of stuff for touch, but it's different stuff </p>
<p> Designed to appeal to experts and novices alike, Microsoft was at pains to point out that it hasn't given up on touch with the new OS. The Charms bar remains for the moment although we expect it to die if you're using a non-touch PC (check out Continum below). Microsoft says it wants to support touch users who have persevered with Windows 8 and "evolve" the touch UI. (Translated: That means it is changing quite a bit.) The task switching will no longer work on the left. So with that and the charms going, that's goodbye to most of the problem with Windows 8 - and a whole philosophy down the pan. Microsoft's Joe Belfiore said at the preview: "We want Windows 7 users to feel like they upgraded from a [Toyota] Prius to a Tesla, but they don't need to learn a new way to drive." </p>
<p> 2. It's BACK! </p>
<p> As we've covered before, the e most noticeable change is the new Start Menu, which looks somewhat like the old start menu. It brings some features from the Windows 8.1 Start Screen, such as live tiles, and can be resized. </p>
<p> 3. Another new Task View (the Windows 8 flippy thing has gone) </p>
<p> Now the Windows 8 task switcher has been unceremoniously dumped, there's a new Task View in Windows 10, too, so users can switch between virtual desktops.That's because Microsoft now recognises that novice users use the taskbar rather than switching in other, cleverer, ways such as Alt+Tab (which also now switches between desktops). </p>
<p> 4. Snap Assist helps you snap windows </p>
<p> A new Snap Assist feature also helps users work out which way is best to snap apps to. You can snap windows into new screens and tile Windows - just as you've been able to since Windows 2.0 or maybe 3.0. </p>
<p> 5. The Command Prompt enters the 21st Century </p>
<p> Another quite amazing feature for those of us that use it is that the command prompt is now getting keyboard shortcuts! So you will be able to paste in your commands! Hardly groundbreaking, but actually pretty exciting. </p>
<p> 6. Improvements to Windows Explorer </p>
<p> A new Home location is the new default view in Windows Explorer. There's also a Share button on the Windows Explorer taskbar (we really hope this is in the context menu, too). </p>
<p> 7. Continum - the special one </p>
<p> This is the best new thing we found out today. Continum is an on-the-fly mode for 2 in 1 devices that can automatically change mode if it detects there is suddenly no keyboard attached. So, for example, a back button appears to help you navigate the Desktop with touch if the keyboard is removed. We reckon the charms will also disappear in non-touch mode, although we've heard conflicting news about that. </p>
<p> 8. Windows 10 Universal apps </p>
<p> Windows 10 will also usher in a new app model - Universal Windows apps. Windows Universal apps are the new name for Metro apps/Modern apps/Windows Store apps. Take your pick on those old monikers, they've got a new one! Presumably (although we don't know as yet) that these will also work on Windows Phone. Windows 10 will be able to run on all devices from phones to servers and there will be a single app store across the lot. All older Windows Store apps will work with Windows 10. </p>
<p> 9. Modern (sorry, Universal) apps now float on the Desktop </p>
<p> The new Universal apps also work on the desktop and 'float' in their own Windows. Microsoft wants to banish the separation between the Modern UI and the Desktop. These 'modern' apps on the desktop have a ... icon for more options - replacing the commands that used to be in the charms on the right-hand side of the screen. </p>
<p> 10. Windows 10 has lots for Business and Enterprise </p>
<p> Microsoft says it hopes to appeal to business with this release of Windows, more so than Windows 8 ever did. Belfiore said they were "starting the dialogue with businesses today". To be honest, it needs to - Windows XP is now ancient and unsupported, while precious other businesses want to make the leap away from Windows 7. But part of the reason why Microsoft is demonstrating the OS without all the consumer features is to show enterprises what the OS is capable of at this stage. This version of Windows will have plenty of other features for enterprise, including a customised store and protection for corporate data. Mobile Device Management will be able to be used for all devices. Windows 10 will keep personal and corporate data separate. </p>

<p> The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Friday recommended to the government creation of a virtual network operator (VNO), a new telecom service provider that would work like a reseller for telecom operators and bill directly to customers. According to the recommendation, a VNO would offer all telecom services permitted under new licences. "Since VNOs are a new concept in India, initially, the duration of the licence of a VNO should be fixed at 10 years, extendable further for 10 years at a time by the licensor," Trai said. Depending on technological developments and experience gathered, it added, the duration of licence can be reviewed after a gap of 3-4 years. A Virtual Network Operator is something like a retailer selling products and services of different companies under one roof, and a customer needs to pay only one bill for all items purchased. "A VNO will be primarily an operator providing various services to an end consumer by using the underlying network of an NSO (Network Service Operator). Moreover, with the rapid advancement of technology, the business model of a VNO will continuously change," Trai said. Trai has recommended that VNOs should be allowed to provide services of more than one operator and create their own service delivery platforms in respect of customer service, billing and value-additions. (Also See:Trai Tries to Make It Harder for Spammers to Copy the Email Addresses It Leaked) Even offering broadband is under the ambit. Trai has taken the line that the terms and conditions of sharing infrastructure between NSOs like Airtel, Vodafone and BSNL, and a VNO should be left to the market. The regulator feels that there should be no cap on number of VNOs that can operate in a service area. Trai also wants a separate category of licence, namely UL (VNO), for such an arrangement. It suggested that access to services for further sale should be left to the mutual agreement between an NSO and a VNO. However, Trai or the Department of Telecom (DoT) shall have right to intervene in the matter as and when required to protect the interests of consumers and the telecom sector, the regulator clarified </p>
<p> Intel Corp signed a standstill agreement earlier this year with Altera Corp that expires on June 1, giving the world's largest chipmaker the option to launch a hostile bid after that, according to sources familiar with the matter.The agreement, disclosed to Reuters by the sources this week, explains why Intel has refrained from launching a tender offer for Altera's shares once their negotiations broke down. It also underscores the risk Altera faces of such a hostile bid. Earlier this month, Altera rejected an unsolicited $54 per share offer from Intel following months of negotiations, the sources said, asking not to be identified discussing confidential information. They said Altera agreed to engage in these talks on the basis that Intel would not go public with any offer until June. In February, Intel discussed offering $58 per share for Altera, based on publicly available information it reviewed at the time, according to the people. After signing a non-disclosure agreement and combing through non-public information, including the company's outlook, it ended up revising down its offer, they said. Last week, Altera posted a sequential 9 percent decline in revenue for the first quarter and said it also expects weakness in its second-quarter guidance, particularly around its wireless business. It is unclear whether Intel would take its proposal directly to shareholders, the sources said, but it remains an option available to it. Intel and Altera both declined to comment. The acquisition of Altera, which makes programmable chips widely used in cellphone towers and industrial applications and by the military, would underscore Intel Chief Executive Officer Brian Krzanich's determination to expand into new markets as the personal computer industry loses steam. TIG Advisors LLC, an investment firm that holds shares in Altera, challenged a nomination to the company's board of directors on Monday over Altera's refusal to engage with Intel about a potential merger. </p>
<p> Chinese drone maker SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd has established a strong early lead in the U.S. commercial market as companies turn to its inexpensive, light-weight flying devices for a host of uses from shooting films to mapping and site inspections.Sixty-one of the 129 companies that received regulatory approval to use unmanned aircraft are using DJI drones, or 47 percent, far ahead of its nearest rival, a Reuters review of federal records as of April 9 shows. Nearly 400 other companies, more than half of the 695 businesses still awaiting approval, have applied to use DJI drones. Shenzhen-based DJI, whose best-selling Phantom 2 Vision+ drone retails for around $1,200 in the United States, estimates that it already has about 70 percent of the commercial market worldwide and a larger portion of the consumer market. Federal records also suggest that DJI is quickly expanding its U.S. market share, thanks in part to a new process speeding federal exemptions for companies that intend to use drones previously vetted by regulators. DJI accounted for about a third of the roughly 50 exemptions granted by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from last September through mid-March. But it has claimed just over half of the 89 exemptions received since then. Industry experts say basic drones such as DJI's are likely to drive the U.S. commercial market for the foreseeable future, meeting business demand for uses such as aerial photography for site inspections, real estate promotions and video production. The market for more sophisticated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is being limited by FAA policy that restricts commercial drone flights to line-of-sight operations at altitudes of 500 feet (152 meters) or less. Those rules are complicating efforts by e-commerce giants Amazon and Google Inc to develop high-tech drones capable of delivering packages over long distances. "Those limitations effectively rule out larger UAVs, which are not going to be cost-effective with that sort of restriction," said Philip Finnegan, the Teal Group's director of corporate analysis. "It's really going to drive things toward the low end of the market." The Teal Group expects the U.S. market for commercial drones to reach $5.4 billion in sales by 2023. Founded in 2006 by Chinese entrepreneur Frank Wang, DJI generated nearly $500 million in revenue in 2014, up from $130 million in the prior year. It expects to exceed $1 billion in sales this year and is in talks with investors to raise new capital. A person familiar with the discussions said DJI, valued at $10 billion, is also pursuing partnerships. Ease of use The emergence of a Chinese company as a dominant player in a new U.S. technology market has so far not raised concerns in Congress. Other Chinese technology companies including telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. have been accused by U.S. lawmakers of posing national security risks, hurting their chances of building a substantial U.S. business. DJI's U.S. business customers include American International Group Inc, Commonwealth Edison in addition to a host of lesser known firms in real estate, insurance, energy, agriculture and film and television. Due to safety concerns, U.S. companies are banned from using drones unless they obtain an FAA exemption. The U.S. aviation regulator proposed rules in February to lift the ban, but final regulations are not expected until late 2016 or early 2017. Since FAA began granting exemptions last September, gains have been limited for DJI's rivals, whose products are often much more expensive. DJI's nearest competitor in the U.S. commercial market is Swiss drone-maker senseFly, owned by Paris-based Parrot, with 8.5 percent of the exempted companies, federal records show. Sensefly's eBee mapping drone package has a price tag of around $25,000. More complex systems made by European and U.S. competitors can cost upwards of $100,000. DJI has gained its market lead without a U.S.-based sales staff. Both hobbyists and business customers purchase drones through online retail outlets and directly from DJI's site, and say they stand out for their ease of use as well as the low price. "Everything just works. A lot of other systems require you to tweak all the settings and parameters," said Paul Callahan, chief executive of New York-based SouthGate Films, which won FAA approval this month to use a DJI drone for aerial photography including solar panel inspections. Some lawmakers, including Senator Charles Schumer of New York, have called on the FAA to ease flying restrictions so drones can be used for a wider array of business applications. Lawmakers have also argued that restrictions on outdoor drone testing have put U.S. companies at a disadvantage to foreign rivals, which operate in less restrictive climates overseas. Some industry executives say low-end drones like DJI's risk becoming commoditised and that the more promising market lies in high-end services such as thermal imaging and 3D mapping. DJI says it has plans to expand into more sophisticated drones. </p>
<p> Apple said the European Commission's investigation into Ireland's tax treatment of multinationals could have a "material" impact if it was determined that Dublin's tax policies represented unfair state aid.Apple said that if the EU's investigations concluded against Ireland, the company could be required to pay past taxes for up to 10 years "reflective of the disallowed state aid." The EU began a formal investigation against Ireland in June last year for alleged state aid to Apple. Apple said that as of March 28, it was unable to estimate the impact of having to pay these taxes. "The company believes the European Commission's assertions are without merit," Apple said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Back in October, the European Union accused Ireland of swerving international tax rules by letting Apple shelter profits worth tens of billions of dollars from revenue collectors in return for maintaining jobs. European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia had told the Dublin government in a letter published on Tuesday that tax deals agreed in 1991 and 2007 amounted to state aid and may have broken EU laws. "The Commission is of the opinion that through those rulings the Irish authorities confer an advantage on Apple," Almunia wrote in the letter, which was dated June 11. Apple said it had received no selective treatment. "We're subject to the same tax laws as the countless other companies who do business in Ireland," a spokesman said. Apple, along with other multinationals, has found its arrangements scrutinised in recent years as corporate tax avoidance rose to the top of the political agenda in the United States and Europe. </p>

<p> A California civil liberties group launched a mobile application on Thursday that will let bystanders record cell phone videos of possible cases of police misconduct and then quickly save the footage to the organisation's computer servers.The California chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union said the app will send the video to the organisation and preserve it even if a phone is seized by police or destroyed. The launch of the ACLU's "Mobile Justice CA" app comes as law enforcement agencies face scrutiny over the use of lethal force, especially against African-Americans, following several high-profile deaths of unarmed black men in encounters with police over the last year in the United States. "It's critical that people understand what is being done by police officers, because what is being done is being done in the name of the public," said Hector Villagra, executive director of the ACLU of Southern California. The app is targeted at residents of the most populous U.S. state, but ACLU chapters have launched similar mobile apps in at least five other states, including New York, Missouri and Mississippi over the last three years. It also sends an alert to anyone with the app who might be in the area, giving them an opportunity to go to the location and observe, the ACLU said. Villagra said the ACLU, in looking at which cases to delve into more deeply, will prioritise those that come with a written report, which is another element users can submit through the app. Records of incidents from users living in other states will be sent to ACLU officials there, he said. ACLU officials advised anyone interacting directly with officers who wants to use the app to announce they are reaching for a phone, because officers might mistake the device for a weapon. A representative from the California Peace Officers Association declined to comment immediately on the app. In the past, advocates for police have expressed concern that people videotaping officers might interfere with their duties in an already tense situation. This week in Los Angeles, the city's Police Commission approved rules governing the use of body cameras as its police department moves towards becoming the largest in the nation to put the devices into widespread use. </p>
<p> Way back in 1989, Asus started out as a consultancy service for motherboard manufacturers. According to industry legend, Asus got a leg up in the industry after designing a motherboard for Intel's 486 CPU without access to a processor, even fixing problems that Intel's own engineers had had. Today, the two are still close partners, and Asus uses Intel's mobile processors in its smartphones and tablets. Last year's ZenFone 4 (Review | Pictures), ZenFone 5, and ZenFone 6 were runaway successes for Asus in India thanks primary to cutthroat pricing and dependable performance. Now, Asus has just launched a new series called ZenFone 2, and the company has been from shouting from the rooftops that the top-end variant has 4GB of RAM. At the moment, Asus is selling the ZenFone 2 in four different variants in India: the ZE551ML (with 4GB of RAM, 64GB ROM and a 5.5-inch full-HD screen); the ZE551ML (with 4GB of RAM, 32GB ROM and a 5.5-inch full-HD screen); the ZenFone 2 ZE551ML (with 2GB of RAM, 16GB ROM and 5.5-inch full-HD screen), and the ZenFone 2 ZE550ML (with 2GB RAM, 16GB ROM and 5.5-inch HD screen). To add to the confusion, both ZE551ML (4GB) models use the 2.3GHz quad-core Intel Atom Z3580 SoC whereas the ZE551ML (2GB) and the ZE550ML are powered by the 1.8GHz quad-core Intel Atom Z3560. Prices range from Rs. 12,999 to Rs. 22,999. There are more variants of the ZenFone 2 which the company might launch later. This naming scheme will be really confusing for buyers, because the model number alone does not mean anything. The folks at Asus could easily have avoided this hotchpotch of variants. Nomenclatures aside, Asus sent us a review unit of the ZenFone 2 ZE551ML with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage space. We put the phone through its paces to find out if 4GB RAM actually makes any difference in real-world usage. Look and feel With the ZenFone 2, Asus has engineered a radical design change that is bound to invite differing opinions. The curve on the rear of the ZenFone 2 is slightly more pronounced, compared to its predecessor, the ZenFone 5 (Review | Pictures). Couple this with the brushed metal finish of the removable plastic back, and the phone reminds us of the HTC One (M8) (Review | Pictures), especially since our review unit was the Glacier Gray variant. All said and done, in our opinion, the phone does look premium. The ZenFone 2's size falls somewhere in between that of the ZenFone 5 and the ZenFone 6 (Review | Pictures). The dimensions need to accomodate a 5.5-inch screen, and the weight has also increased as a result. The phone has dimensions of 152.5x77.2x10.9mm and weighs 170g. Despite these numbers, the ZenFone 2 doesn't feel chunky because of the curved rear. The phone can be gripped nicely but don't expect it to be comfortable to use with one hand. The most noticeable change is that the volume rocker has been moved to the rear of the device. We saw such an implementation for the first time on the LG G2, and it then continued through LG's subsequent releases. In LG's phones, the power button is wedged in between the volume buttons, whereas on the ZenFone 2, the power button is on the top of the phone. The problem with this placement is that it is difficult to reach while using the phone with one hand. The button is flush with the top edge, as a result of which usability takes a hit. Thankfully, you might never need to use this button because the software allows you to double-tap the screen to wake the phone or to put it to sleep. The volume rocker has a slightly ribbed texture and really good tactile feedback. It doesn't matter if you are right-handed or left-handed; your index finger naturally reaches for it. The placement of the physical buttons means the left and right edges of the phone are naked. The Micro-USB port and microphone are at the bottom of the phone. A 3.5mm jack and microphone are present on the top on either sides of the power button. Apart from the volume rocker, the rear side of the phone also houses the camera and the speaker grille. The display takes up close to 70 percent of the front of the ZenFone 2, and the bezel is fairly slim on all sides. The earpiece, front camera, ambient light sensor and notification LED are lined up above the screen. The phone has a row of capacitive buttons below the display, which aren't backlit. Below them is metal "chin" which continues to use Asus' trademark concentric circle finish. It adds a dash of character to the design of the phone. Specifications and software Our review unit is the top-end ZE551ML variant of the ZenFone 2, which has the most high-end components of the lineup. The phone has 4GB of RAM, which is the first for any smartphone we've reviewed. It also has a 2.3GHz quad-core Intel Atom Z3580 processor with an integrated PowerVR G6430 GPU. Incidentally, the same graphics chip is also used in the iPhone 5s. The phone has 32GB of internal storage space and there is a microSD card slot which can be used to add 64GB more space. Furthermore, the Micro-USB port can be used to plug external USB drives in. The phone accepts two Micro-SIM cards. The primary SIM card can connect to 4G networks including the 2300MHz Indian 4G frequency band. Both SIM cards can connect to 3G networks. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth v4.0, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac and NFC. The ZenFone 2 has a 13-megapixel primary camera with dual-LED flash and a 5-megapixel front-facing secondary camera. The phone also has a fairly large 3000mAh battery under the hood. The 5.5-inch IPS LCD screen has a resolution of 1080x1920, which translates to a pixel density of 403ppi. Images look crisp and the colours are also accurately reproduced. Even the viewing angles are pretty good. The only weakness of this screen is that even at maximum brightness it looks a bit dull, which in turn affects the sunlight legibility. Asus ships the ZenFone 2 with Android Lollipop out-of-the-box, coated with Asus' custom ZenUI skin on top. ZenUI is quite a departure from stock Android but adds a few neat tweaks that could be useful for quite a few users, and is as zippy as ever. For example, the Smart Group functionality in the app drawer bunches similar apps together into folders, which comes in handy when you don't want to go through the trouble of sorting apps one by one. Similarly, the App Lock feature lets you add a password to any app, preventing others from opening things you don't want them to. Zen UI also allows for a lot of customisation, and you can change themes, icon packs and the homepage scrolling animation. The one-handed operation function has been tweaked slightly to allow more control to the user - you can now manually drag from the corner of the screen to set the screen size without having to make do with preset screen sizes. ZenMotion is another software feature that gives users the ability to draw gestures on screen when the phone is asleep, to open any particular app. Asus also adds a in-house apps: Asus ZenCircle, a social networking tool for creators; PhotoCollage; WebStorage, a cloud-based storage solution; and Mirror, which lets you use the front camera and screen as a mirror. Camera The primary camera on the Asus ZenFone 5 was a competent performer. Unfortunately, Asus has failed to recreate that on the ZenFone 2. We consistently saw mediocre results with the 13-megapixel shooter, which should have been more powerful than the 8-megapixel one on the ZenFone 5. The average image quality of the ZenFone 2's primary camera is yet another reason for us to reiterate that the megapixel count doesn't directly correlate to camera quality.

<p> The sample shots from our daylight testing sessions were laden with over-exposed areas around the edges and colour burning as well. The sensor needs shade to capture even half-decent images. We also noticed a fair amount of noise and barrel distortion around the edges in some daylight shots. </p>
<p> Performance aside, Asus' camera app is feature-rich and has a ton of shooting modes. The coolest feature of this app is that the Low Light mode pops up automatically the moment it detects that the light is not enough for the sensor to capture all details. Shots are restricted to 3-megapixels (or lower) in this mode, but the tradeoff is worth it. Shots taken in this mode looked significantly more detailed and were better lit too. This is a better alternative to using the dual-LED flash for capturing pictures because they look artificial. (Click for full size) </p>
<p> As expected, the 1080p videos captured with the primary camera were not great either. In what is becoming the norm these days, the camera app has beautification options for the front camera. Anyway, the front camera captures warped images which could be a direct result of making the lens wider than the one on the ZenFone 5. The details are pretty decent, though. Performance If there is one area where the ZenFone 2 shines it is core performance. We zipped through general operations like opening apps and games. The speed is comparable to that of Snapdragon-toting flagship devices. The performance of the ZenFone 2 is so good that at one point we had more than 20 apps and games running in the background and only 1.5GB of the available 4GB RAM was being utilised. In the AnTuTu and Quadrant benchmark tests, the phone scored a healthy 32,086 and 20,523 respectively. We installed Asphalt 8 and noticed that it displayed the full range of special effects while running pretty smoothly. The gaming performance of the phone is corroborated by the benchmark results. 3DMark Ice Storm's basic and extreme tests maxed out, whereas the Ultimate benchmark returned a score of 17,654. Similarly, the phone scored a healthy 30fps in GFXbench. All our test videos played without any glitches but the sound quality of the loudspeaker is not too great. Thankfully, our reference earphones sounded great when connected to the 3.5mm headphone jack. Asus doesn't provide a headset with this device. The sound quality in calls was average; we noticed some hiss on our end and the connection dropped at least twice. The battery life, although better than its predecessor, is still not that great. It lasted 7 hours and 52 minutes in our video loop battery test, and in daily use we had to connect it to a charger at the end of the day. Asus implements a fast charging tech that manages to charge the phone pretty fast and could somewhat make up for this performance. Verdict With the ZenFone 2, Asus improves on most aspects of the Zenfone 5 except for the camera. The 4GB of RAM could come in handy if you often have multiple browser tabs open at the same time. Also, the PowerVR graphics chip is a solid performer and that is a boon for Android gamers. The ZenFone 2 ZE551ML with 64GB of internal storage is priced at Rs. 22,999 whereas the 32GB variant will set you back by Rs. 19,999. This means that Asus is now competing with the Xiaomi Mi4 (Review | Pictures), OnePlus One (Review | Pictures), and HTC Desire 820 (Review | Pictures) - all of which have better cameras than the ZenFone 2's 13-megapixel shooter. If you can live without 4GB of RAM, then the ZenFone 2 ZE551ML with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage space is available for much less at Rs. 14,999. The ZenFone 2 ZE550ML is available at the even lower cost of Rs. 12,999, which puts it in a different category altogether. All said and done, our advice to potential buyers is to carefully choose the right variant of the ZenFone 2 according to their requirements. We understand that having so many SKUs of the same phone will be confusing, but at the same time we appreciate Asus for providing choices. </p>

<doc id="file24175673" filename="ten-questions-to-ask-when-buying-a-laptop" parent_folder="web1" url="https://www.itnewsafrica.com/2017/07/ten-questions-to-ask-when-buying-a-laptop/">
<p> Ten questions to ask when buying a laptop </p>
<p> Buying a new laptop can be an expensive undertaking. Choosing the right device and accompanying accessories will not only prevent frequent and costly upgrades, but will ensure that you get the most out of your machine. </p>
<p> However, the average consumer seldom does a thorough assessment of their needs before parting with their hard-earned money for a new device. </p>
<p> Mohamed El Aougri, Sales Director at Targus SA suggests pondering these ten questions when choosing your new laptop: </p>
<p> 1. What will I be using my laptop for? If you are a video editor, you need to ask about a device with a good processor, a great sound adapter and an excellent graphics card. The display needs to be high definition and big enough to comfortably view high-quality video, while portable enough to carry around without strain. On the other hand, a simple business laptop should suffice if you are a bookkeeper, depending on the level of sophistication needed. </p>
<p> 2. Will the device be for personal use or work? In either case, you should consider what software is needed to protect and manage important tasks and consider external hard drives for personal and/or work folders. If your workplace has a BYOD policy and you need to buy your own work laptop, you should look for software that can provide an added layer of protection on shared networks. </p>
<p> 3. What is my budget? This should not be a limiting factor when looking for a simple word processor and business machine. For more media-intensive, but non-essential applications such as social media, entertainment and gaming, you might want to consider a customisable desktop computer at a later stage when extra money becomes available. If possible, wait until you’ve saved enough money to spend more on a high-quality, all-purpose device. </p>
<p> 4. Can I add components? Some laptops are more easily upgradable, which is an important consideration if you are currently on a tight budget. When extra funds become available, faster hard drives, RAM and processors can be swapped in. </p>
<p> 5. What capabilities do I use the most? Do you do a lot of video conferencing? If you do, check what kind of webcam your proposed laptop has. The wireless and networking capability of the laptop, as well as a powerful wireless router must be explored thoroughly, along with processing speeds for the best video capability. </p>
<p> 6. What accessories/peripherals will I need? Accessories such as mice, external keyboards, speakers, monitors, printers, webcams and external DVD drives all enrich the functionality of your laptop computer. Will you need docking stations or will you plug everything directly onto the laptop? If it’s the latter, then the laptop must have enough USB ports and extensions to plug each of your peripherals in. </p>
<p> 7. What kind of environments will I working in? This is important, as it will determine the protective equipment needed, especially the laptop bag. A construction engineer might want an extra-tough, padded backpack, while a lawyer might prefer a ‘wheelybag’ to also carry additional documents. There are also products to protect your peripherals – for example laptop keyboards can be fitted with silicone keyboard protector skins to protect from liquid spillage. </p>
<p> 8. How long do I see myself using it for? Technology advances at a breakneck pace. If you know you’ll want to keep up with future developments in audio-visual standards, you’ll want a laptop that is powerful enough to handle much bigger files, and more complex software applications as new versions are released. Your device should also be powerful enough to take advantage of faster broadband speeds as they hit the market. </p>
<p> 9. Who else will be using it? A more durable, less expensive laptop installed with child protection software should be looked at if children will the laptop for school projects. If inexperienced users will be using your laptop, it might be an idea to rather buy a simpler device which runs most cloud-based applications for added security, and just in case someone deletes a folder on the desktop. </p>
<p> 10. What style do I want? While this is more of an aesthetic consideration, it should not be dismissed. If you don’t enjoy how your laptop looks and feels, you will be less likely to take care of it and purchase the right accessories and software to make it work optimally. The most important thing is that you are happy with the device and enjoy it for as many years as possible. </p>

<p> Muslim followers of western civilization and of scientific, protestant Islam have put aside the concept of Sufism in Islam. The enormous development of world of logic and science has convinced the humanity that there is only one source of knowledge and that is the material knowledge. Science only enquires those things, which can be observed physically and never recognizes true dreams as a subject of enquiry. However there is other source of knowledge apart from the worldly knowledge and is termed as “Al Ghaib” as described in Surah Al-Baqarah Ayat 1-3. Muslims should have faith in “Al-Ghaib” and Allah is the source of this knowledge. Allah reveals His messages / secrets to those whom He wants to know and those who have a true heart. </p>
<p> The subject of this article “True Dreams” is one part of the spiritual knowledge. Purpose of this writing is to elaborate the importance of true dreams to the readers. When one sees a dream it is very important to classify that dream. There are three kinds of dreams i) Satanic dreams ii) Dreams that originate from one’s “own self” and iii) True dreams that are a message from Almighty Allah and must be interpreted in the light of Quran and Ahadith. </p>
<p> It is the wisdom of Almighty Allah that true dreams are shown to people with secret messages hidden in them. The decoding of this message or in other words “interpretation” of the dream is not that simple. One must not reveal his dream to anyone except the one who is able to interpret it. The tragedy is that there are not many people who can correctly interpret any dream. The author feels that there is need to convey the method of interpretation of some big scholars in the history of Islam and who used Quran and Hadith for this purpose. So that people can understand what can possibly be the meaning of their dream, which correlates with their own circumstances. </p>
<p> The channel is available in our social media website page. You can find out the interpretation of your dream on the following link: https://goo.gl/8CCE6q </p>
<p> and you can post your questions in comments and send us questions. </p>
<p> May Allah accept our humble effort. </p>

<p> Introducing Assassin�s Creed� Unity Paris, 1789 � The French Revolution turns a once-magnificent city into a place of terror and chaos. Its cobblestone streets run red with the blood of commoners who dared to rise up against the oppressive aristocracy. As the nation tears itself apart, a young man named Arno will embark on an extraordinary journey to expose the true powers behind the Revolution. His pursuit will throw him into the middle of a ruthless struggle for the fate of a nation, and transform him into a true Master Assassin. About Assassin�s Creed� Unity Assassin�s Creed� Unity is an action/adventure game set in the city of Paris during one of its darkest hours, the French Revolution. Take ownership of the story by customising Arno’s equipement to make the experience unique to you, both visually and mechanically. In addition to an epic single-player experience, Assassin�s Creed Unity delivers the excitement of playing with up to three friends through online cooperative gameplay in specific missions. Throughout the game, take part in one of the most pivotal moments of French history in a compelling storyline and a breath-taking playground that brought you the city of lights of today. A UNIQUE CO-OP EXPERIENCE YOU MUST PLAY TO BELIEVE In addition to an epic single-player campaign, join with up to three friends online and experience the open world of 18th-century Paris. Pull ambitious heists and take part in unique narrative-driven missions designed exclusively for co-op play. Sabotage an execution. Protect an emperor. Assassinate a Templar agent. Victory won�t be easy; you and your lethal band must rely on communication, coordination, and diverse skills to accomplish your missions, then vanish into the shadows. A RUTHLESS NEW HERO FOR A BRUTAL WORLD Play as Arno, an entirely new breed of Assassin, and take down your prey with a range of new weapons such as the Phantom Blade, a hidden blade with crossbow capabilities. BRAND-NEW PARKOUR, COMBAT,AND STEALTH GAMEPLAY Enjoy an unprecedented degree of freedom and control over your Assassin. Full motion control with new parkour mechanics for free running up, across, and down city walls and buildings. A reinvented fighting system provides a richer combat experience based on skill, timing, and flow. Enhanced stealth gameplay, including a new stealth mode, cover system, and crowd-manipulation techniques. Stay hidden, stalk your prey, and strike without warning. ASSASSIN�S CREED RE-INVENTED Assassin�s Creed Unity is a reimagining for the franchise, starting with the core gameplay pillars that have defined it since the beginning: Navigation (or Parkour), Stealth, and Combat. These new systems will help give you an unprecedented control over your assassin and are some of the key elements that will define the next generation of Assassin�s Creed. The Parkour system puts you in control of every step as you careen through streets and across rooftops, or as you nimbly descend into a darkened alleyway. Stealth empowers you to instinctively use your environment and the crowds of Paris to cloak your attacks and cover your escape. Combat will truly test your mettle, whether you find yourself in artful duels or an all-out brawl. Look below to learn more about how these systems will give you more freedom and control than ever before. PARKOUR EVERYTHING IS PERMITTED In Assassin�s Creed Unity, we�ve created a brand new Parkour system that gives you a wider and more precise range of movement as you dash through and vault over the dense landscape of Paris. Climbing atop the roofs of Paris is the perfect way to survey your environment, but as an assassin, it�s just as important to descend quickly and silently to take out your target undetected. Assassin�s Creed Unity will offer two modes of navigation that allow you to �Parkour Up� buildings and obstacles, or �Parkour Down� for a controlled descent. You can also take dramatic leaps when you �Parkour Down� to cross a street by leaping from the rooftops to the windowsill of an opposing building.This keeps the action fluid, fast paced and completely uninterrupted. STEALTH DISAPPEAR ANYWHERE Stealth is the most important skill in the assassin�s repertoire. There are now limitless opportunities to stalk your enemies, strike them down from the shadows, and disappear into the crowds of Paris. Take a covert approach anytime and anywhere at the press of a button. While sneaking, your actions will be harder to detect. Crouch down to slink through the city, take cover anywhere in the environment to break line of sight, or slip between alleyways to sneak past enemies without a trace. It�s easier to make a clean escape when you�re poised to disappear at a moment�s notice. COMBAT COMBAT: THE ART OF THE KILL We reinvented Combat in Assassin�s Creed Unity to be more artful, challenging, and varied than ever before. No two battles are alike, but if you master your technique, they all end the same way � with your opponents at your feet. Assassin�s Creed� Unity DOWNLOAD LINK(S) CRACK ONLY RELOADED </p>

<p> Share All sharing options for: Toshiba is officially out of the laptop business </p>
<p> Toshiba quietly exited the laptop business once and for all last week, ending a 35-year run by transferring its remaining minority stake in its PC business to Sharp. Two years ago, Toshiba sold an 80.1 percent stake of its PC business to Sharp for $36 million, and Sharp renamed the division Dynabook. Sharp exercised its right to buy the remaining 19.1 percent of shares back in June, and Toshiba released a statement August 4th that the deal was completed </p>
<p> “As a result of this transfer, Dynabook has become a wholly owned subsidiary of Sharp,” Toshiba said in a statement. </p>
<p> The company made the first PC laptop in 1985: The T1100 boasted internal rechargeable batteries, a 3.5-inch floppy drive, and 256K of memory. ComputerWorld’s 20-year retrospective of the T1100 notes that Toshiba executives were unsure about the portable computer, but eventually came around, and began selling the T1100 for around $2,000. </p>
