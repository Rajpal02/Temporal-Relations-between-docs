Campbell, who served briefly as the nation's leader and Conservative Party Leader in late 1993, later clarified her comments, saying, "I know Palm Beach well and am sorry if it gets a big hit. I wish I cd believe that it wd shake up Trump’s climate change denial!" Campbell's tweet met with much negative reaction on social media. Responding to her original tweet, Canadian People's Party Leader Maxime Bernier tweeted, "This woman is a disgrace." Canadian YouTuber and Conservative columnist J.J. McCullough said Campbell "continues to be a national embarrassment." There were also a torrent of comments, mostly negative, on her facebook page, which hasn't been updated since September.

<p> Members of the European Parliament from France and Ireland are threatening to block a trade deal between the Europe and South America's trading blocs over rampant destruction of the rainforests in Brazil. Environmentalists accuse Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro of cutting protection to the area deemed crucial to combating climate change. The rainforests are being clear cut for farming at a record pace, say environmentalists. NASA, however, has said that overall fire activity across the Amazon basin this year has been close to the average compared to the past 15 years. For now,E officials are defending the deal, which has taken 20 years to hammer out with the Mercosur trading bloc, because they say it ties them into honoring the Paris Agreement's environmental rules.

<p> Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has resigned following a blistering attack on coalition partner Matteo Salvini. Conte said Salvini had been "irresponsible" in creating a new political crisis for Italy for "personal and party interests." Salvini, the leader of the populist League Party, had tabled a no confidence motion against Conte, and earlier said his party could no longer work with Five Star. The League and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement formed a coalition to govern just 14 months ago with Conte as an independent as prime minister.

<p> South Korean President Moon Jae-in offered an olive branch to Japan to end an ongoing trade dispute Thursday, saying Seoul will "gladly join hands" if Japan wants to talk. Moon's government has been accusing Japan of weaponizing trade to target its export-dependent economy and retaliate against South Korean court rulings calling for Japanese companies to offer reparations to South Koreans forced into labor during World War II. Tokyo's measures struck a nerve in South Korea, where many still harbor resentment over Japan's ruthless colonial rule from 1910 to 1945. After threatening stern countermeasures and declaring that South Korea would "never lose" to Japan again, Moon has taken a more conciliatory tone over the past week as there was relief in Seoul that the impact of Japan's trade measures might not be as bad as initially thought.

<p> A Sinn Fein Party regional councilor's post on Twitter praising the memory of an IRA hunger striker has prompted a call for him to resign. Sean Bateson, Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens, a region covering the northern part of Northern Ireland, praised Thomas McElwee on the 38th anniversary of his death in prison after a 62-day hunger strike. He was in prison for murder after his conviction. Ulster Unionist Party Leader Robin Swann called on Bateson to resign, saying his comments showed Bateson could not be a "mayor for all the citizens." But Bateson, a 26-year-old history teacher, said he would continue to honor IRA members who died during the Troubles era, and noted on twitter (post below) that the right to remember one's dead is protected under the Good Friday Agreement which brought peace to the region. </p>

In a letter addressed to U.S. Reps. Brad Schneider, Lee Zeldin, Jerry Nadler and Ann Wagner, the co-sponsors of the bill and staunch supporters of Israel, the Israeli lawmakers asserted that a Palestinian state is “far more dangerous to Israel” than the boycott movement against Israel. A neighboring Palestinian State would “undoubtedly be a dysfunctional terrorist state” which would “undermine stability” in the region and “severely damage the national security of both Israel and the United States."

He compared the differences to a marriage, and called for a quick separation, "without slapping, for the children," he joked, at a party rally. Salvini's right-leaning wing party is well ahead in opinion polls, due mainly to his stance against illegal immigration.

<p> Months of social unrest in Hong Kong moved into a new phase Saturday, with both anti-government protesters and police using fresh strategies. Fewer people were taking to the streets, but some were shouting "revolution," and spitting rage-filled epithets against Mainland China, rather than just opposition to an unpopular Mainland extradition bill, which the government has "shelved" but not cancelled permanently. Police again used tear gas, and petrol bombs were thrown by demonstrators, who once more had gathered illegally across the city in defiance of protest bans issued by the authorities.

<p> Amarinder Singh to meet BJP high command in Delhi today </p>
<p> New Delhi: Former Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh is likely to meet senior BJP leaders in New Delhi today. There are reports that the meeting is likely to discuss the likely seat-sharing for the upcoming assembly elections (Punjab Assembly Elections) in the northern state today. Amarinder Singh left for the national capital last Thursday. Earlier, Captain Amarinder had met Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Shekhawat who is also BJP in charge of Punjab assembly elections on December 7. A week later, on December 14, Shekhawat had made a statement saying that Singh's party 'Punjab Lok Congress' and BJP may tie up with each other for the elections. </p>
<p> At that time, Shekhawat had also said, "Both parties are like-minded and have similar views on many issues. Before Shekhawat, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had said on December 4 that "BJP is in talks with Akali faction led by Amarinder Singh and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa of Shiromani Akali Dal (United) and an alliance may be formed before assembly elections in Punjab. You must be aware that Captain Amarinder Singh resigned from the Congress in September this year amid a power struggle with the party's Punjab unit president Navjot Singh Sidhu. More than 50 MLAs had written to Congress President Sonia Gandhi demanding Singh's removal from the top post. The former Punjab Chief Minister had announced his separate party in November. </p>
<p> Later, on December 12, Amarinder Singh had said, "Talks are on with BJP and Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa's party for an alliance and an announcement will be made to adjust the seat soon. Let me tell you that elections to 117 assembly seats in Punjab are scheduled to be held in 2022. In the 2017 elections, Congress won 77 seats to win an absolute majority and after a decade showed the Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP government the way out. Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), on the other hand, emerged as the second-largest party in Punjab as it won 20 of the total seats. </p>

<p> Arlene Foster to step down as Northern Ireland first minister </p>
<p> This article is more than 10 months old </p>
<p> Foster says she will stand aside as DUP leader on 28 May and as first minister a month later </p>
<p> Arlene Foster has announced she is stepping down as leader of the Democratic Unionist party and Northern Ireland’s first minister after a sudden internal party revolt. </p>
<p> Foster issued a statement on Wednesday afternoon saying she would step aside as DUP leader on 28 May and as first minister at the end of June, bringing fresh tumult to a region hit by protests over the post-Brexit Irish Sea border. </p>
<p> The announcement came just a day after most of the DUP’s 27 Stormont assembly members and reportedly four of its eight Westminster MPs signed letters calling for an unprecedented leadership contest. </p>
<p> Foster said she had notified the party chair of her decision. “It is important to give space over the next few weeks for the party officers to make arrangements for the election of a new leader,” she said. “When elected I will work with the new leader on transition arrangements.” </p>
<p> The DUP struck down its leader to try to avert a voter backlash in next year’s assembly elections. Having supported Brexit and paved Boris Johnson’s path to Downing Street, the party stands accused of complicity in the EU exit deal’s Northern Ireland protocol. Ousting Foster appears to be an attempt to turn the page. </p>
<p> Free Presbyterians – Christian evangelicals who comprise a dwindling but still important chunk of the party’s base – were also angered when Foster and two DUP ministers abstained last week on an assembly vote to ban gay conversion practices. </p>
<p> The rebellion marked an abrupt and humiliating end to a tenure that began in 2015 amid excitement and goodwill – Foster was the youngest person and first woman to lead the DUP and Northern Ireland – only to curdle into rancour and disillusionment. </p>
<p> The “cash-for-ash” scandal and clashes with Sinn Féin collapsed power-sharing for three years. It revived last year only to be engulfed by Covid-19 and the fallout from Brexit, leaving the first minister a beleaguered figure reviled by nationalists and undermined within the DUP. </p>
<p> Foster’s exit is likely to open a new, uncertain chapter for Northern Ireland, which faces a DUP leadership race and change of command at the Stormont executive amid a pandemic and widespread unionist anger over the region’s post-Brexit trade border with Great Britain, which they fear will weaken the nation’s position in the UK. </p>
<p> There is no obvious successor to Foster but the MPs Sammy Wilson, Gavin Robinson and Jeffrey Donaldson have been tipped along with Edwin Poots, a Stormont assembly member and agriculture minister. On Wednesday he pulled out of a planned meeting with his Irish ministerial counterpart, Charlie McConalogue, in a move widely viewed as a nod to DUP hardliners. </p>
<p> Under party rules an electorate of 41 assembly members, MPs and peers will choose the new leader. </p>
<p> Foster’s departure suggests a crisis in unionist leadership on the cusp of Northern Ireland’s centenary – commemorations are to take place next week – and in the run-up to the loyalist marching season, which many fear will lead to fresh street disturbances. </p>
<p> Her resignation statement struck a conciliatory tone often absent in her previously combative political rhetoric. “It has been the privilege of my life to serve the people of Northern Ireland as their first minister and to represent my home constituency of Fermanagh/South Tyrone,” she said. </p>
<p> “As I prepare to depart the political stage it is my view that if Northern Ireland is to prosper, then it will only do so built on the foundations of successful and durable devolution. That will require continued hard work and real determination and courage on all sides. </p>
<p> “Whilst the focus is on me today I recognise that will pass. For me my decision to enter politics was never about party or person, it was about speaking up for the voiceless and building a Northern Ireland which could prosper and be at peace within the United Kingdom. I am the first to recognise there have been ups and downs over the last five and a half years.” </p>
<p> Her elevation had broken a glass ceiling, she said. “I am glad I inspired other women to enter politics and spurred them on to take up elected office. I understand the misogynistic criticisms that female public figures have to take and sadly it’s the same for all women in public life. I want to encourage you to keep going and don’t let the online lynch mobs get you down.” </p>
<p> Foster grew up near the border in rural County Fermanagh where Protestants felt besieged by IRA attacks during the Troubles. Her father, a farmer and part-time police officer, was shot and badly injured outside the family home. </p>
<p> Figures from across the political spectrum in and outside Northern Ireland paid tribute. Johnson thanked Foster for “her dedication to the people of Northern Ireland over many years”. The prime minister tweeted: “She will continue to play a vital role as first minister until June and I hope that she stays in public service for years to come.” </p>
<p> Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary of state, called Foster a dedicated public servant who inspired women. </p>
<p> Micheál Martin, Ireland’s taoiseach, said she had worked hard in a fraught environment. “As a person who has personal experience of the suffering that violence brings, Arlene knows more than most how difficult it is, but also how important it is, to work together for the peace and prosperity for all.” </p>
<p> Sinn Féin’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, expressed sympathy but did not laud Foster. “Today is undoubtedly a difficult day for Arlene and I extend my regards to her and her family.” </p>

<p> #BREAKING #UK: Theresa May's Brexit Plan Soundly Rejected In "Devastating" House Of Commons Vote </p>
<p> [world politics news] </p>
<p> Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal has been rejected by 230 votes - the largest defeat for a sitting government in history. Parliamentarians voted by 432 to 202 to reject the deal, which sets out the terms of Britain's exit from the EU on March 29. In response, May called a vote of "no confidence" in her government, preempting Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who also tabled a vote, which could trigger a general election. The confidence vote is expected to be held at about 7 pm London time on Wednesday. The defeat is a devastating blow for May, who has spent more than two years hammering out a deal with the EU. It is unclear whether she will stay on as prime minister after the defeat.

<p> Britain was “negligent” in applying European Union customs and import rules from 2011 to 2017, leading to lost revenues for the bloc, according to a ruling by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). OLAF, the EU’s anti-fraud office, has argued more than half of all clothes and shoes that were brought in from China to the UK over that period were undervalued. The agency is now demanding the UK to cover these losses, according to a report in The Guardian. </p>
<p> The bloc’s anti-fraud office claimed the method used by British officials to calculate the value of goods was “inadequate” and had led to a “shift of fraudulent operations from other Member States to the United Kingdom”. </p>
<p> The final number the EU will be able to demand from the UK may be slightly different as the ECJ’s method to calculate the lost revenues was “incorrect,” according to Politico. </p>
<p> Now the EU has been brutally mocked on social media over the latest clash with the UK, with “Gully Foyle #UKTrade” (@TerraOrBust) writing: “Aw, is someone missing Treasure Island?” </p>
<p> This stems from Germany having previously reportedly habitually referring to the UK as “Treasure Island”. </p>
<p> But post-Brexit tensions between the UK and EU could be about to escalate even further, with The Telegraph also reporting the failure to fully apply the rules was a “sensitive” issue. </p>
<p> This was because the EU had allowed the UK to police and its own customs framework on the Irish Sea border as part of the now hotly-disputed Northern Ireland Protocol, which has driven an even wider wedge between the two sides. </p>
<p> Paul Woodward, a customs and trade specialist at the Institute of Export & International Trade, explained the riling from the ECJ showed “even countries can fall foul” of fraud i relation to global trade and end up having to pay out huge sums. </p>
<p> The expert has advised businesses to pay close attention to compliance with customs and VAT rules. </p>
<p> As a result, trade with the UK delivered 69 percent of EU’s entire trade surplus with the rest of the world, which totalled £175.4billion, Facts4EU.org suggested. </p>
<p> The analysis had also indicated, for the 12-month period, trade data showed the EU has been selling an average of £691million worth of goods to the UK every day. </p>
<p> There was also a significant gap between what the EU’s 27 member states sold to the UK – and what Britain sells to the EU27 – with the bloc’s sales to the UK 91 percent higher than Britain’s sales to the bloc. </p>

<p> On Thursday, contentious BJP leader Sangeet Som required a ban on the screening of the riot-themed movie Shorgul in Muzaffarnagar. </p>
<p> Som, who has been under the scanner for his supposed role in the Muzaffarnagar uprisings, claimed that numerous political leaders had been depicted in a precisely improper manner in the film. </p>
<p> The release date for the approaching film Shorgul has been deferred by a week and it will now hit the screens on 1 July instead of 24 June. </p>
<p> The motion picture traces upon grave topics that have leaked in the recent past such as Muzaffarnagar, Godhra, Babri Masjid riots. It also makes allusions to official misdoings, mind games and debatable master strokes of some high profile personages. </p>
<p> Police officers in the state have been put on alert, IG Sujit Pandey said, and added that the law and order situation will not be permitted to worsen.

<p> We all are hearing about attacks on African nationals and it’s a disgrace not only to the law and order but the whole nation. Rising crimes in Delhi has put an ugly image of the city in the whole world. Recently a statement by Lalu Prasad Yadav made us think. </p>
<p> Latest political headlines in India was about Former Bihar CM, Lalu Prasad Yadav who has claimed that BJP is defaming Bihar by calling it ‘JungleRaj’ and questioned why BJP is not able to see the increasing crimes in Delhi where African nationals are getting openly murdered. </p>
<p> The emerging trends in Indian politics show that parties can do anything to get votes. Lalu Prasad Yadav has made a point and if we look closely he is not lying as well. If the tourists are not safe even in the capital of India then calling ‘JungleRaj’ in other states does not seem justified. Before questioning other politicians BJP should look into their city and the situation of law and order. </p>

Fu is the chairperson of the National People’s Congress’ Foreign Affairs Committee can see a sense of gap between the perceptions of china and US in terms of their war strategies. </p>
<p> According to the World Politics journal, the countries, China and US are increasing their relationship in terms of benefits. The presidents of both the countries make sure to arrange meeting at least twice a year. Also, since this relationship has started building up they have also become the trading partners of each other. In fact, China has now become the biggest trading partner of US and that too on a monthly basis. It was big news that almost 5 million people travelled between the two nations in 2015. Not only this but the both the countries also accelerated the signing of the Paris agreement which was based on Climate Change. </p>
<p> World Politics journal also stated that Fu Ying said that apart from these accomplishments also, some US experts have declared that IF China continues to grow in the same speed as now; there will be conflicts between the two countries which will be inevitable. Fu said that need for cooperation and impact of competition both are growing day by day. It’s high time to take charge of it and start working towards it. </p>

<doc id="file24171877" filename="democracy-is-down-but-not-out" parent_folder="web1" url="https://politic-news.space/2021/world-politics/democracy-is-down-but-not-out/">
<p> Democracy Is Down but Not Out </p>
<p> Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarussian dictator, snatches a dissident from midair. Military strongman Assimi Goita launches another coup in Mali. Benjamin Netanyahu escalates a military conflict to save his own political skin in Israel. In the United States, the Republican Party launches a full-court press to suppress the vote. </p>
<p> Authoritarianism, like war, makes headlines. It’s hard for democracy to compete against political crackdowns, military coups and unhinged pronouncements. Sure, democracies engage in periodic elections and produce landmark pieces of legislation. But what makes democracy, like peace, successful is not the unexpected rupture, such as the election of Barack Obama, but the boring quotidian. Citizens express their opinions in public meetings. Lawmakers receive constituents in their offices. Potholes get fixed. That’s not exactly clickbait. </p>
<p> Because the absence of war doesn’t make headlines, as Stephen Pinker has argued, the news media amplifies the impression that violence is omnipresent and constantly escalating when it splashes mass murder, genocide and war crimes on the front page. Peace may well be prevalent, but it isn’t newsworthy. </p>
<p> Russia Ramps Up Pressure Against Kremlin Critics </p>
<p> The same can be said about democracy, which has been suffering for some time from bad press. Democracies have been dragged down by corruption, hijacked by authoritarian politicians, associated with unpopular economic reforms and proven incapable (so far) of addressing major global problems like the climate crisis. After a brief surge in popularity in the immediate post-Cold War period, democracy according to the general consensus has been in retreat. </p>
<p> Judging from recent quantitative assessments, the retreat has become a rout. The title of the latest Freedom House survey, for instance, is “Democracy Under Siege.” The report details how freedom around the world has eroded for the last 15 years, with 2020 featuring the greatest decline yet. The Economist Intelligence Unit, which produces a Democracy Index every year, promoted its 2020 report with the headline, “Global Democracy Has a Very Bad Year.” The authoritarian responses to the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the worst showing so far for the model, with the average global score plummeting from the previous year. Meanwhile, the Rule of Law Index for 2020 also registered a drop for the third year in a row. </p>
<p> If we extrapolate from the current trend lines, democracy will be gone in a couple of decades, melted away like the polar ice. But it’s always dangerous to make such extrapolations given history’s tendency to move in cycles not straight lines. So, let’s look at some reasons why democracy might be in for a comeback. </p>
<p> The Pandemic Recedes in America </p>
<p> Much of the reason for democracy’s dismal record in 2020 was the expansion of executive power and state controls in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Some of those power grabs, such as Vladimir Putin’s constitutional changes in Russia, are still in place. Some countries, like India and Brazil, are still struggling with both COVID-19 and powerful authoritarian leaders. </p>
<p> But even with the continued high rate of infection in a number of countries, the overall trajectory of the disease is downward. Since peaking in late April, the reported number of global cases has dropped nearly by half. So, two trend lines are now intersecting: the lifting of pandemic restrictions and the backlash against hapless authoritarians. </p>
<p> Americans, for instance, are coming to terms with both the retreat of COVID and the removal of Donald Trump from the White House, Facebook and Twitter. The Biden administration is undoing many of Trump’s undemocratic moves, including those imposed during the pandemic around immigration and refugees. The attempts by the Republican Party to tamp down voter turnout proved spectacularly unsuccessful in 2020, which despite the pandemic featured the largest-ever increase in votes from one election to the next. In terms of the voting-age population, you have to go back to 1960 to find an election with a higher percentage turnout than the 62% rate in 2020. </p>
<p> This surge in voters helped put Joe Biden over the top. It has also motivated the Republican Party to redouble its efforts, this time at the state level, to suppress the vote. It is doing so under the false narrative that electoral fraud is widespread and that President Biden’s victory is somehow illegitimate. And it is setting the stage to orchestrate an authentic election theft in 2024. </p>
<p> The backlash against these anti-democratic moves has been encouraging, however. When the state of Georgia passed its voting restrictions in April, pressure from voting rights advocates forced prominent Georgia corporations like Coca-Cola and Delta to reverse themselves and come out against the bill (though only after the bill had already passed). Major League Baseball pulled its all-star game from Atlanta, and Hollywood has also threatened a boycott. </p>
<p> These moves motivated Texas-based companies to protest that state’s version of voting restrictions before the legislature scheduled a vote. None of that stopped Texas Republicans from pushing ahead with the bill. So, last weekend, Texas Democrats had to deploy the nuclear option of walking out of the chamber to stop the vote suppression bill from passing. These courageous Texans, up against a powerful and determined state Republican Party, are now looking to the federal government to safeguard voting rights. </p>
<p> At the federal level, the Democrats have put forward for the second time a comprehensive voting reform bill, the For the People Act, to expand access, reduce corruption and limit the impact of money on politics. The House approved a version of this bill in 2019, but it died in the Republican-controlled Senate. The House passed the reboot in March, but it again faces a difficult road to passage in the Senate because filibuster rules require at least 60 votes to pass and Democrats can muster only 50 (plus the vice-president’s). </p>
<p> A failure to find “10 good Republicans” for this bill, the cadre that Senator Joe Manchin naively expected to step forward to pass legislation creating a commission to investigate the January 6 insurrection on Capitol Hill, may finally push the Democrats to scrap or at least significantly modify the filibuster rules, which were famously used to block further enfranchisement of African-Americans in the 20th century. </p>
<p> High voter turnout and efforts to secure voting rights are not the only signs of a healthy US democracy. Last year, the largest civic protests in US history took place as tens of millions of Americans expressed their disgust with police violence in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Civic organizations stepped forward to fight the pandemic and ensure more equitable access to vaccines. Young people, in particular, are engaged in large numbers on the climate crisis, gun control and reproductive health. After a long winter of discontent under Trump, perhaps it’s time for an “American Spring.” </p>
<p> Mixed Record Elsewhere for Democracy </p>
<p> Europe, meanwhile, is coming out of the pandemic in slightly stronger shape politically. The budget compromise that took place at the end of 2020, which ended up providing considerable relief to the economically disadvantaged countries of the southern tier, effectively saved the European Union from disintegrating out of a lack of solidarity. Alas, the compromise also watered down the EU’s criticism of its easternmost members, particularly Poland and Hungary, for their violations of the bloc’s commitments to human rights and rule of law. </p>
<p> But there’s hope on the horizon here as well. Eastern Europe appears to be on the verge of a political sea change. Voters brought down Bulgaria’s right-wing populist leader Boyko Borissov in elections in April, and the new caretaker government has begun to dismantle his political system of cronyism. In Slovenia, tens of thousands of protesters have massed in the capital of Ljubljana, the largest demonstration in years, to demand the resignation of the Trump-like prime minister Janez Jansa. The near-total ban on abortion orchestrated by the right-wing government in Poland has motivated mass protests by women throughout the country, and even “Polish grannies” have mobilized in support of a free press and the rule of law. A finally united opposition in Hungary, meanwhile, is catching up in the polls to Prime Minister Viktor Orban ahead of elections next year. </p>
<p> The far right, with their contempt for human rights, free media, rule of law and political checks and balances, are the greatest threat to democracy within democracies. Fortunately, they are not doing very well in Western Europe either. The anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland has witnessed a significant drop in support in Germany, while Lega in Italy has also declined in popularity. Golden Dawn has disappeared from the scene in Greece. Vox is still the third most popular party in Spain, but it hasn’t managed to rise much above 15% in the polls, which is the same story for the Sweden Democrats (stuck at around 19%). Only in France and Finland are the far-right parties continuing to prosper. Marine Le Pen currently leads the polls against French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of next year’s election, while the Finns Party leads by a couple of percentage points in the polls but with elections not likely before 2023. </p>
<p> Elsewhere in the world, the pandemic may result in more political casualties for far-right populists, as they get caught in the ebbing of the Trump wave. Brazilians are protesting throughout the country under the banner of impeaching Jair Bolsonaro, a president who, like Trump, has compiled a spectacularly poor record in dealing with COVID-19. Bolsonaro’s approval rating has fallen to a new low under 25%. The still-popular former leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, recently cleared by the courts to run again for office, appears to be assembling a broad political coalition to oust Bolsonaro in the elections set for next year. </p>
<p> Hard-right leader Ivan Duque has achieved the distinction of being the least popular leader in Colombian history. Politically, it doesn’t matter so much, since he can’t run again for president in next year’s election. But the public’s disgust with the violence in Colombia and the economic inequality exacerbated by the pandemic will likely apply as well to any of his would-be hard-right successors. </p>
<p> The extraordinary mishandling of the pandemic in India has had a similar effect on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s popularity, which has also recently fallen to a new low. However, after seven years in office, he remains quite popular, with a 63% approval rating. </p>
<p> Modi’s Teflon reputation speaks to the fragility of democracy in many parts of the world. Many voters are attracted to right-wing nationalists like Modi — Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, Nayib Bukele in El Salvador — who promise to “get the job done” regardless of the political and economic costs. Such leaders can rapidly turn a democratic country into a putatively democratic one, which makes the step into authentic authoritarianism that much easier. </p>
<p> The coups in Mali and Myanmar, China’s crackdown in Hong Kong, the enduring miseries in North Korea, Venezuela and Eritrea — these are all reminders that, however fragile democracy might be in formally democratic states, politics can always get a lot worse. </p>
<p> Lukashenko: Strong or Weak? </p>
<p> Take the example of Belarus, where Alexander Lukashenko has ruled supreme since 1994. Thanks to his own ruthlessness and the patronage of neighboring Russia, Lukashenko has weathered mass protests that would have ousted leaders of weaker disposition. </p>
<p> His latest outrage was to order the grounding of a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania as it was flying over Belarus — just so that he could apprehend a young dissident, Roman Protasevich, and his Russian girlfriend, Sofia Sapega. Virtually everyone has decried this blatant violation of international laws and norms with the exception, of course, of Putin and others in the Russian president’s orbit. The editor of the Russian media conglomerate RT, Margarita Simonyan, tweeted, “Never did I think I would envy Belarus. But now I do. [Lukashenko] performed beautifully.” </p>
<p> Lukashenko indeed came across as all-powerful in this episode. But this is an illusion. Putin has not hesitated to assassinate his critics, even when they are living outside Russia. Lukashenko doesn’t have that kind of reach or audacity, so he has to wait until dissidents are within his own airspace to strike. I’d like to believe that the opposition in Belarus takes heart from this desperate move — is Lukashenko really so scared of a single dissident? — and doubles down on its efforts to oust the tyrant. </p>
<p> Outside of Putin and his toadies, Lukashenko doesn’t have many defenders. This elaborate effort to capture a dissident only further isolates the Belarussian strongman. Even putatively democratic states, like Poland and Hungary, have unequivocally denounced Lukashenko. </p>
<p> Anti-democratic actions like the Ryanair stunt capture headlines in ways that pro-democratic efforts rarely do. Honestly, had you even heard of Roman Protasevich before this affair? Along with all the other depressing news of the day, from Texas to Mali, this brazen move suggests that democracy is teetering on the edge of an abyss. </p>
<p> But all the patient organizing against the strongmen that doesn’t make it into the news will ultimately prove the fragility of tyranny. When it comes to anti-democrats like Lukashenko, they will one day discover that the military, the police and the party have abandoned them. And it will be they who teeter at the abyss, their hands scrabbling for a secure hold, when along comes democracy to give them a firm pat on the back. </p>

<p> How Joe Biden Became Irish </p>
<p> While it is cliche for political figures to represent themselves as being “as American as apple pie,” President Joe Biden has actually long marketed another selling point: He’s likewise as Irish as a pint of Guinness (in spite of being, like his predecessor, a teetotaler). </p>
<p> Advertisements </p>
<p> More so than any president considering that John F. Kennedy — the just other Catholic to hold the workplace — Biden’s Irish heritage is main to his public personality. He is so highly related to it that Sarah Palin, notoriously, might not get his name right. During prep sessions for their 2008 vice governmental dispute, she kept describing him as Senator O’Biden, according to an account offered by a project assistant. His Secret Service codename, on the other hand, is Celtic. </p>
<p> Biden visits his Irish Catholic identity truthfully. He invested his earliest years surrounded by his mom’s Irish American household, the Finnegans, in the Irish American fortress of Scranton, Pennsylvania. After relocating to Delaware throughout primary school, he was schooled by nuns at Parochial schools. </p>
<p> He likewise ensures to highlight it. Like numerous Irish-American political leaders, he is a routine at St. Patrick’s Day banquets and makes regular allusions to his Irish Catholic upbringing in public remarks. Biden, however, has actually gone even more than many. He commissioned a genealogy of his Irish forefathers, rolling it out for public consumption at the tail end of his vice presidency, when he and his household explored the Emerald Isle to excellent excitement, going to ancestral websites. </p>
<p> “His background led to this,” stated Timothy Meagher, a teacher emeritus at Catholic University and scholar of Irish American history. At the very same time, “He plays on it, some of it consciously.” </p>
<p> Biden has actually had a lot of factors to lean into his Irish heritage for many years. In a various period, it assisted him transport a Kennedy mystique, when, as a young senator in the years after Bobby Kennedy’s assassination, he was viewed as a successor to Camelot. Later, it assisted Biden act as a bridge to Irish Americans and other white Catholics, who have actually wandered from the Democratic Party in current years. Throughout, it has actually assisted him boost an individual brand name constructed on Average Joe relatability. </p>
<p> “He kind of embodies the American common man,” Meagher stated. “And Irish Americans have been an important manifestation of that image from the beginning of the republic.” </p>
<p> But that’s just half the story of Biden’s heritage — or, more specifically, five-eighths of it. While Biden accepts his Irish roots, the rest of his ancestral tree hardly ever shows up. And that side of the household has a more complex tradition. </p>
<p> Biden’s Irish Catholicism was essential to his political brand name from the start. Press accounts of his family-run 1972 Senate project took on it to highlight the resemblances to John Kennedy’s own family-filled Senate quote 20 years previously. </p>
<p> For journalism, the deaths of Biden’s very first partner, Neilia, and baby child, Naomi, in an auto accident simply a month after his upset ’72 win, just made the contrast to the tragedy-scarred Kennedy clan even more tempting. </p>
<p> “The Washington press corps ushered me to town as a kind of poor Kennedy cousin: I was Irish, Catholic, young, toothsome,” he remembers of his early Senate days in his 2007 narrative. “The reporters were sure I was a liberal.” </p>
<p> While Biden recommends journalism misread his ideological bent, he never ever avoided the Irish Catholic part. </p>
<p> Throughout the Troubles, Biden voiced assistance for the Irish cause and in some cases did something about it in the Senate. In 1985, he opposed an extradition treaty with Britain that would have impacted members of the Irish Republican Army who had actually left to the United States. Taking problem with the British administration of justice in Northern Ireland, he assisted require the GOP to thin down the contract. </p>
<p> Asked about his heroes, Biden would typically call Wolfe Tone, an eighteenth-century Protestant Irishman sentenced to death for his function leading a revolt versus British guideline. “He had nothing to gain on the face of it,” Biden told Irish America magazine in 1987, “but he sought to relieve the oppression of the Catholics caused by the Penal Laws. He gave his life for the principle of civil rights for all people.” Later, he started mentioning the Irishman Seamus Heaney as his preferred poet. </p>
<p> Biden’s background has actually likewise provided him a source of theatrical icebreakers. When he hosted British Prime Minister David Cameron for a state luncheon in 2012 in the elaborate Franklin Dining Room in Foggy Bottom, he joked about his Irish household’s standard antipathy for the English. “Ambrose Finnegan,” he called out towards the ceiling, conjuring up the name of his maternal grandpa, who as soon as alerted him not to trust WASP political leaders. “Things have changed.” </p>
<p> After being presented by his child Ashley’s spouse, Howard Krein, at a health care event four years later, Biden split, “As usual I’m going to say something that I shouldn’t. Every Irish Catholic father looks forward to the day that his daughter will marry a Jewish surgeon.” </p>
<p> In more subtle methods, Meagher sees the imprint of Irish American patterns in essential elements of Biden’s political identity. </p>
<p> One is the reality that Biden has actually made a profession in politics in the very first location, holding workplace continually, conserve a four-year space in the Trump period, for a half century. This method to politics as an occupation contrasts, Meagher stated, with a WASP suitable of electoral politics as a pursuit for the separately rich. </p>
<p> Meagher traced this pattern back to the 19th century. Unlike numerous other immigrant groups, he stated, typical individuals from Ireland had experience with electoral politics prior to concerning the U.S. While arrivals from Ireland tended to do not have wealth or profitable occupational abilities, their varieties and political savvy made professions in electoral politics a welcoming course, he stated. </p>
<p> “It was an honorable profession,” stated Peter Quinn, a previous speechwriter to the New York guvs Hugh Carey and Mario Cuomo, and an Irish Catholic. “People bragged about being in politics.” </p>
<p> Meagher and Quinn each pointed out Biden’s absence of strong ideological dedications as another quality attribute of old-school Irish American political leaders, who, they stated, tended to harbor practical streaks. This worked, Quinn stated, when attempting to knit together multiethnic unions. </p>
<p> That was the difficulty dealing with Democrats in 2008, when Biden’s strong Irish Catholic identity made him an appealing running mate for Barack Obama. In that year’s Democratic main, white Catholic citizens had actually broken decisively for Hillary Clinton, leading the Pew Research Center to opine on “Obama’s Catholic voter problem.” Biden’s addition to the ticket was welcomed as a prospective treatment to that issue. (This in spite of the reality that Biden’s positions on social problems, particularly abortion, have at times put him at chances with the Catholic Church, a typical problem for Catholic Democrats.) </p>
<p> As vice president, he continued to include his Irish heritage into his public personality. Just after St. Patrick’s Day in 2013, Biden accepted his induction into Irish America’s Hall of Fame with a speech that connected his Irish forefathers’ ocean-crossing experience with his administration’s top priorities on migration reform. </p>
<p> Three years later on, Biden and a group of his loved ones made a main journey to Ireland to reconnect with their roots. </p>
<p> To accompany the journey, Biden commissioned a genealogy covering his mom’s side of the household, which was launched to the general public. He also gave an interview to Ancestry.com, which ran posts about the genealogists’ findings. </p>
<p> Left out of the excitement was the majority of Biden’s paternal family tree, which has to do with three-quarters English. While he has made a habit of name-checking his father’s Irish Hanafee ancestors, Biden’s non-Irish origins has actually not played a popular function in his public image. </p>
<p> According to Biden, it has actually likewise played a restricted function in his own self-image, on account of the early impact of his mom’s household. When the future president was a young kid, he remembered his great-aunt Gertie informing him, “Your father’s not a bad man. He’s just English.” </p>
<p> “There is an ongoing debate as to whether Biden is an Irish, English or German name,” Biden informed Irish America in 1987, however his Scranton loved ones chosen not to harp on the possibility that they were living under the very same roofing as an Englishman. “My grandfather and my mother were never crazy about it being English and used to say, ‘Tell him it’s Dutch,’” he remembered. (Later, Biden started explaining his surname, precisely, as an English name). </p>
<p> Biden’s dad, the then-senator stated, appeared to take the Finnegans’ side sometimes, revealing the belief that the name Biden was Irish. </p>
<p> At least that’s the method Biden remembered it to Irish America as he got ready for his very first governmental run. Expressions of identity have a method of adjusting themselves to the political minute. (In America, the German Trumps, in the after-effects of World War II, took to passing as Swedish, according to one of the former president’s cousins, who has actually handled the function of Trump household historian.) </p>
<p> There was little factor, or outlet, for Biden to reveal an English side to his identity as an up-and-coming Democratic political leader in Delaware beginning in the early ’70s. The French Huguenot du Pont household and their allies controlled Republican politics in the state, an extension of a more comprehensive Northern pattern in which native WASPs usually lined up with the Republican Party versus white ethnic and Black Democrats. </p>
<p> There was still an “iron bond” in between Irish Catholics and the Democratic Party at that time, possibly finest detailed, Quinn stated, by an old joke: One Irish Catholic female relies on another and states, “Did you hear? Mr. Murphy became a Republican.” To which the other female reacts, “That’s impossible. I saw him at mass on Sunday.” </p>
<p> It was natural, then, for Biden to welcome his Irishness. </p>
<p> Republicans of that period dealt with a various calculus. Ireland’s previous ambassador to the U.S., Sean Donlon, has actually stated that Ronald Reagan asked him not to publicize information about the then-candidate’s Irish heritage in the run-up to the 1980 governmental election. In order to interest his celebration’s base, Donlon has actually stated, Reagan wished to be viewed as a WASP. (Reagan did make a minimum of periodic referrals to his Irish roots throughout that project, and he accepted them after winning, dispatching an assistant to position an Inauguration Day phone call to well-wishers in his ancestral town of Ballyporeen.) </p>
<p> As it ends up, there were likewise factors for Biden to prevent calling excessive attention to his paternal origins. </p>
<p> Years prior to he revealed the Irish branches of his ancestral tree, Biden had another, fuller genealogy prepared. Back in 2004, the then-senator cold-called James Petty, a genealogist in Salt Lake City (the Mormon Church runs the world’s biggest genealogical research study library there). Biden at first desired aid investigating his Scranton forefathers. Eventually, he commissioned a complete genealogy. The outcomes were not released. </p>
<p> James Petty passed away in 2020, according to his widow and expert partner, Mary Petty, who stated she dealt with the Biden genealogy. Mary Petty informed me she took a seat with Biden’s children Beau and Hunter as part of the procedure. She decreased to supply me any info about the genealogy itself, mentioning customer privacy. </p>
<p> But in the wake of Biden’s election last fall, Alexander Bannerman, a genealogist in West Virginia, went to deal with the very first total, reliable genealogy of the 46th president to be produced for publication. </p>
<p> Along with Gary Boyd Roberts, a specialist in governmental family trees, Bannerman co-authored a post on Biden’s origins for the Winter 2021 issue of American Ancestors. The publication is a publication of the New England Historic Genealogical Society, an extensively pointed out authority in the field of origins. </p>
<p> Bannerman informed me that on his dad’s side, a few of Biden’s forefathers shackled individuals. </p>
<p> He indicated Biden’s great-great-great-grandfather, Jesse Robinett, who shackled 2 individuals in Allegany County, Maryland, in the 1800 census. Another 3rd-great-grandfather, Thomas Randle, shackled a 14-year-old male in the 1st District of Baltimore County, Maryland, in 1850, he stated, mentioning census records and servant schedules, which were different headcounts of servants performed along with the census in 1850 and 1860. </p>
<p> In 1860, census records reveal that Randle and his household had actually transferred to Baltimore County’s 13th District, Bannerman stated, and an 1860 servant schedule for the 13th District once again reveals Randle shackling a single male. (The spelling of Randle differs in some records, as prevails for that duration, and the spelling of Robinette, which is Biden’s middle name, has actually altered in time). </p>
<p> A White House representative, Mike Gwin, did not react to ask for remark. </p>
<p> The genealogy and accompanying short article that Bannerman and Roberts produced do not make note of these ancestral ties to slavery. Bannerman discussed it prevails for Americans with colonial-era roots on the continent to have forefathers who shackled individuals. </p>
<p> In the short article, Bannerman and Roberts do keep in mind a remote tie to Varina Anne Banks Howell, the partner of Confederate President Jefferson Davis, through Biden’s forefather Allen Robanet, who most likely concerned Pennsylvania from England in the 1680s. Bannerman stated it was the very first governmental kinship tie to Howell that he has actually stumbled upon in his research study. </p>
<p> For an individual with colonial origins, Bannerman stated, Biden’s ties to slavery were reasonably modest. “Not a lot of ancestors, and not a lot of slaves,” he stated. </p>
<p> Tens of countless Americans have ancestral ties to enslavers or the Confederacy, and couple of would argue those ties make them unsuited for workplace. But the presence of any slave-owning forefathers can provide a quandary to a political leader whose objective is usually to impart warm sensations about their individual bio. </p>
<p> And such connections regularly draw in extreme public interest. In current years, discoveries about the ancestral ties of Mitch McConnell and Beto O’Rourke to slavery have actually both created extensive news protection, to call however 2. </p>
<p> In O’Rourke’s case, he picked to come to grips with the discoveries in a personal blog post. </p>
<p> “We all need to know our own story as it relates to the national story, much as I am learning mine,” he composed. “It is only then, I believe, that we can take the necessary steps to repair the damage done and stop visiting this injustice on the generations that follow ours.” </p>
<p> Such ties can be particularly stuffed for a white Democrat who need to draw in frustrating assistance from Black citizens to win a nationwide election. At no time at all was this more real than in the summertime of 2020, when racial justice demonstrations set off by a policeman’s murder of an unarmed Black male, George Floyd, roiled the nation like they had actually refrained from doing in years. </p>
<p> Beneath the raw profusions of outrage and aggravation, the discontent was sustained in part by the connection in between the centuries-old origins of slavery in America and the oppressions of today day. (Some of the statues of slaveholders toppled during the unrest were spray-painted with “1619,” a recommendation to the year shackled Africans were very first required to the future United States. This is likewise the name of a recent New York Times Magazine project that argued that slavery’s long-lasting impact ought to be thought about main to American history, winning a Pulitzer Prize and gathering debate at the same time.) </p>
<p> If ever there was a time that Biden’s shackling forefathers might provide a political issue for him, it remained in that minute. </p>
<p> In June, with the discontent at its height, an incorrect web meme flowed commonly declaring that a Biden forefather, Joseph J. Biden, owned servants and defended the Confederacy. At the time, there was not yet a reliable research study of Biden’s paternal origins offered to the general public, so it was delegated mainstream fact-checkers to examine the meme. USA Today, and the fact-checking websites Politifact and Snopes, all concluded that the meme’s claim was unproven which the image apparently revealing a Biden forefather was of some other male. In death, the Snopes short article discusses the possibility that Biden was come down from the Maryland Robinettes, who shackled individuals. </p>
<p> In August, the fact-checking site followed up. It assessed proof sent by a reader that Biden’s forefather Thomas Randle shackled an individual in Maryland in 1850, according to census records and a servant schedule. Snopes found the evidence compelling that the Biden forefather and the male noted as owner on the servant schedule were one and the very same, however it ranked the claim “unproven.” Other mainstream sources of info did not pursue the concern throughout the election. </p>
<p> It was not till after Biden won the presidency that Bannerman and Roberts developed their genealogy, permitting Bannerman — who is now at work on a genealogy of First Lady Jill Biden — to verify to me what some individuals online had actually currently been declaring about Thomas Randle and the Robinettes. </p>
<p> In completion, Biden’s origins did not enter into latest thing inferno of an election year battle over race and American history. </p>
<p> It might be because Biden has actually discreetly handled the general public understanding of his background in a manner that optimized his appeal while deflecting unpleasant analysis. Or it might simply be the luck of the Irish. </p>

<p> Under attack over alleged attempts of tinkering with quotas, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday accused the Bihar's grand alliance of plotting to take away five per cent share in reservations for SC, ST and OBCs and give it to "a particular community", a move he vowed to oppose. "Aapke aarakshan ki suraksha ke liye, Modi jaan ki baazi laga dega. Inko khula karna meri jimmewari hai," he said speaking in Hindi. Loosely translated, he meant he would not spare any effort to ensure reservation for the weaker lot. He claimed he would "expose" the Grand Alliance's twisted schemes to take away what he alleges is a 5 % share for some other community. </p>
<p> Modi stepped up his attack alleging that Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and his RJD ally Lalu Prasad were “conspiring” to snatch 5 per cent each from the quota meant for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, OBCs and EBCs and “give it to another community” but he did not say which one this was. Opposition parties slammed Modi’s comments saying he is trying to polarise voters. Modi brought the narrative back to how the elections started - with a bribery sting video that embarassed the Grand Alliance no end before even a single vote was cast. Modi hit out at the Congress and its “Madam” saying that three decades of “misrule” had made Bihar’s youth leave the state to find work elsewhere. Speaking to reporters, Nitish Kumar rubbished Modi’s claims. “There is no fact in the PM’s allegation of us plotting to take away 5 per cent reservation from SC, ST and OBC to give it to a particular community,” he said. "The leaders of this 'Mahaswarth' (opportunistic) alliance are trying to mislead the people on the issue of reservation ... It is clear through the discussion of our Constitution makers that reservation cannot be given on the basis of religion. The Supreme Court has said reservation cannot be more than 50 per cent. There is a cap. "I come from an extremely backward class and understand the pain of having been born to a poor woman. I will not allow this to happen. I pledge to protect the rights of dalits, mahadalits and backward classes," he said addressing an election rally in Buxar. Modi attacked Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad and Sonia Gandhi for trying to "mislead" the people on the issue of reservation. If the anti-BJP alliance is voted to power 'jungle raj' will return and crimes like kidnappings and atrocities on women will rise, he said. To watch the Bihar Elections Phase 3 Live updates online stay tuned with us. Modi also attacked Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and RJD chief Lalu Prasad for not acting against the corrupt and cited recent examples where their MLAs and candidates were allegedly found taking bribes and "fixing deals".

Polling is peaceful in the state as we have received no information of any untoward untoward incident," Additional Chief Electoral Officer R Lakshmanan said. A CRPF commandant, identified as P K Mishra, and his body guard Mantu Kumar were injured in a road mishap in Bihar's Munger district during patrolling of elections. The motor-cycle borne commandant and the jawan were injured when they lost control of the vehicle in order to save an animal, Mishra, who has been admitted to Sadar hospital, said. Voters in Kalyanpur seat booth numbers 172, 178 boycott polls in protest over closure of jute mill Voter turnout till 9AM: Banka-13.99%, Samastipur 13.55%, Khagaria 11.77%, Begusarai- 15%, Jamui – 15.4%, Munger 13%, Bhagalpur 12% </p>
<p> 7% voting has been registered till 8 AM. In Lakhisarai 6%; Banka 7.3%; Begusarai 6.8%; Bhagalpur 5%; Nawada 5%; Munger 6%; Samastipur has recorded the lowest percentage in the first hour at 2.8% Police personnel dies of heart attack in Begusarai's polling booth no. 182 Nitish Kumar will be addressing rallies in Sasaram, Rohtas, Aurangabad and Arval on Monday even as the first phase of polls is underway in the state. Avadhesh Kushwaha calls allegations against him a conspiracy. "I am very popular in my constituency. I have done lot for development of my area, allegations on me are a part of hatched conspiracy by political opponents. I will bring truth before people. I was hurt by allegations therefore I have resigned," he said. BJP claims there is there is intense protest against Nitish Kumar-Lalu Prasad. "One reason is they tied knot with Congress. People are angry of their jungle raj. Surely BJP will win this election. Bihar has suffered the jungle raj for a long time," BJP leader Radha Mohan Singh said. EC directs concerned District Magistrate to probe into alleged sting involving former Bihar Cabinet Minister Awadhesh Kushwaha. Additional Chief Electoral Officer R Lakshamanan has told local media that the faulty EVMs have been replaced and polling is continuing uninterrupted. Some anomalies are being reported from some polling states in the state. In booth number 183 in Barbigha, EVM is not working. EVMs also not working at booth number 25 in Bhagalpur and one booth in Munger. The voting has not even begun at booth number 209 in Nawada. Narendra Modi urges people of Bihar to vote in large numbers. "Urging all those voting today in Bihar to vote in large numbers. I particularly urge my young friends to cast their vote," Modi tweets. According to the Association for Democratic Reforms and the National Election Watch, as many as 130 candidates in the first round of polls face serious criminal charges including murder. 'Mahagathbandhan' will hit a blow in this election: BJP leader Giriraj Singh. Jamui DM Kaushal Kishore appeals to people to cast their vote. "People are casting their vote on development,"he said. He also claimed that booth capturing and violence have become things of past now. The first phase of the high voltage Bihar Election Polls has begun as voting began for the first phase at 7 am on Monday. As many as 49 constituencies from across 10 districts from the eastern and central part of the state will vote on Monday sealing the fate of 583 candidates including 54 women nominees. A total of 1,35,72,339 electorates, including 72,37,253 men, 63,17,602 women and 405 of third gender, are eligible to exercise their right to vote. Voting will end at 3 PM and 4 PM in the booths situated areas where Naxals hold the sway in the state. While Central Para Military Force will be deployed on all the booths, drones and helicopter would also be put in service. The elections have turned into a bipolar contest between two big alliances – National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Mahagathbandhan. While the NDA comprises of small players like Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP), Hindustan Awam Morcha (HAM), Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from the front, the Mahagathbandhan consists of the Janata Dal United (JDU), the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and the Congress. But on the ground, the battle has confined to two political giants, who have become the face of the respective alliances –Narendra Modi representing the NDA and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who has been touted as the face of a developing Bihar for the last decade. The battle is one of high-stakes, and has the capacity to make or break several political careers. Just like those whose fate is at stake, the voter is also divided, probably more than ever. Divided along several factors such as caste, desire for development, and choice of leaders, many voters say they are yet to make up their minds giving sleepless night to the candidates. But there are certain factors which are going to impact the results. Meanwhile, leaving no stone unturned Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a rally in Bhabua on Monday. Though the Janata Dal United and the Rashtriya Janata Dal met Election Commission officials on Sunday seeking a ban on the live telecast on the PM's rallies when the polls are underway, the EC gave a go ahead for the rally.

<p> India’s New Education Policy: Not Paying Attention </p>
<p> It was instructive that probably the most consequential event in the life of the Indian Republic merited nothing more than three pro-forma single-sentence references to “epidemics and pandemics” in the recently-adopted National Education Policy 2020. The policy must have been discussed and agreed by the Union Cabinet wearing masks, a clear and present reminder of how much has changed. Yet the document approved acknowledges COVID-19 only to exhort higher education institutions to undertake epidemiological research and advocate greater use of technology in delivery mechanisms. </p>
<p> 360˚ Context: The State of the Indian Republic </p>
<p> READ MORE </p>
<p> That is a pity. COVID-19 has brought lessons in its wake that we will ignore at our peril. In a societal sense, the pandemic has laid bare the fragile and counterproductive assumptions that underpin the way we have organized ourselves. Education, as the primary mechanism that drives long-term change in a society, must respond in a way that protects and strengthens children today and the nation tomorrow. </p>
<p> What We Value </p>
<p> Three important mechanisms of social organization that have been taken for granted in education during recent decades are institutionalization, urbanization and globalization. If COVID-19 is not a one-off event — and there is no reason to assume that it is given how exploitative our engagement with our environment continues to be — each one of them must be reassessed for worth, especially for how they affect the future of our children. </p>
<p> Institutionalization has promoted the idea that the only learning worth our children’s time and our money is the one that is provided in schools, colleges and universities. Across most of the world, this has made learning information-centric and uncritical. It has packed children into rows and columns in classrooms and made them unfamiliar with their surroundings. It has taken them away from the productive use of their hands and bodies, and valorized “brain work,” creating an artificial crisis of periodic unemployment even before the unimaginable destruction of employment caused by COVID-19. </p>
<p> It has snapped children’s’ connections with their land, their environment, their culture and their communities, replacing them with words in ink on paper or typeface on a computer screen. In India, a mindless pedagogy has further ensured that institutionalization fails even in its own objectives as student achievement in “learning metrics,” mainly focused on literacy, numeracy and data, has kept falling. </p>
<p> With pre-school centers closed, COVID-19 has brought attention squarely to the role of parents in the holistic development of their young children. (We started Sajag, a program for coaching caregivers in nurturing care in April 2020. It now reaches over 1.5 million families and is set to expand further. Many others have started similar programs.) By forcing the closure of schools and colleges, COVID-19 presents us with the opportunity to explore what exactly is being lost when schools close. It also creates the possibility that we will discover how much there is to learn in communities, on land, in relationships and in discovery and invention, outside the school. It has the promise of suggesting a radical overhaul of what we value in education. </p>
<p> Organized for Economic Efficiency </p>
<p> Urbanization has caused us to believe that ghettoization of people in cities is inevitable as we “develop.” With economic and social policies in most countries oriented toward this shibboleth, we have seen unhygienic conditions grow exponentially in cities, even as rural communities have been devastated by the loss of populations. Mental health challenges in urban communities have become alarming, accentuated simply by the inhuman stresses that accompany urban living. For our young, it has meant few physical spaces for wholesome growth and play, little opportunity for meaningful community engagement, and a social landscape tragically barren of nurturing experiences. </p>
<p> By attacking densely-packed urban communities disproportionately, COVID-19 has laid bare the fallacy of organizing ourselves solely for economic efficiency. It asks us to reconsider how physical communities should be laid out, how large they should be, how they should harmonize into the surrounding landscape and how their cultural, economic and political sinews should function. We have also been fed the inevitability of globalization, almost as a primal force. It is true that it promises economic efficiency, but we have, in the process, lost much. </p>
<p> Diversity is the essence of risk reduction and long-term survival and thriving, whether at the level of an organization, a community, a nation or, indeed, evolution of life itself. In a few short decades, blinded by the promise of economic efficiency, we have traded diversity away for massive inequality and loss of local skills, trades, crafts, self-reliance, agency and autonomy. Our textbooks, the only source of information promoted by our policies, have consistently failed to ignite an examination of the underlying assumptions and the all too visible outcomes among our children. </p>
<p> COVID-19 has alerted us to the downsides of these Faustian bargains. Its dramatic spread is certainly a result of our way of life, with air travel being the primary vector. The heart-breaking spectacle of tens of millions of migrant workers walking hundreds of kilometers and sleeping on asphalt roads in India’s scorching summer heat is another. They discovered that they had no means of support, no community, no fallback when their employment ceased. COVID-19 has also awakened us rudely to the reality that having the world’s fastest GDP growth rate is no protection against ending up with the world’s steepest fall in GDP and widespread misery. </p>
<p> Globalizing Impulse </p>
<p> The globalizing impulse has led to entire education systems being unmoored from authentic experience and unresponsive to local needs. As a result, it has fostered and valorized the creation of an alienating and alienated elite. The reaction to that is a distressing level of anti-intellectualism throughout the world. That, of course, creates the fodder for the assembly line that is perhaps the holy grail of the globalizing philosophy in the first place, but it also creates a dangerous level of instability and irrationality in society that can eventually only tear everything apart. </p>
<p> To the extent that we continue to regard globalization as self-evidently good, we create the potential for damaging our children, inhibiting their learning and creating a world that is less fit for them. Time has come to drop the fiction that local wisdom is somehow inferior and to engage in a meaningful dialogue that hasn’t foreclosed on the alternatives. </p>
<p> To disregard such fundamental questions in an education policy adopted in the middle of the pandemic makes little sense. These should be the subject of widespread dialogue, including in our schools and colleges, before and after the adoption of the policy. The sensibilities that arise from such deliberations must inform our liberal education as well as the conduct of professions such as engineering, town planning, medicine, economics, sociology and, indeed, education. An education policy that doesn’t even consider the questions relevant to how our education system should be structured has surely not paid attention. </p>

<p> Is Non-Alignment Back in Fashion in Modi’s India? </p>
<p> Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi surprisingly participated in the virtual Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) summit in May for the first time since he took office in 2014. Modi had skipped the 2016 and 2019 NAM summits, but his attendance in 2020 could signal a revival of this once-important alliance. </p>
<p> The NAM, a Cold War-era grouping of nations of which India was a founding member, originated in 1961, when anti-colonialist developing nations had little choice but to align with either the United States or the Soviet Union. For many countries like India, this choice was a non-starter. A recently independent and underdeveloped India could not afford to get embroiled in great power politics. Instead, Jawaharlal Nehru chose a pragmatic third path and, along with Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser and then Yugoslavia’s Josip Broz Tito, pioneered NAM to give voice and space to nations at similar junctures. This normative posturing made sense at the time even from a realist perspective. </p>
<p> Timing </p>
<p> But with the fall of the Soviet Union, NAM struggled for relevance in a unipolar world. Free from the Cold War shackles, nations could pursue policies based on their own interests. Ever since, NAM has maintained a purposeless existence, with many of its members far from being non-aligned and, in fact, explicitly aligned in one way or another. Forever trying to differentiate himself from his idealistic predecessor, Nehru, of India’s main opposition Congress party, Modi fashioned himself as a foreign policy pragmatist and moved away from an irrelevant NAM. </p>
<p> It is not surprising then that Modi’s participation in the summit polarized reactions at home. Shekhar Gupta, writing for The Print, refers to NAM in today’s context as “a class of losers” and points at India as an openly declared strategic ally of the United States and part of several security groupings that include American participation, such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. Terms like “fence-sitter” are often hurled at India’s foreign policy based on its penchant to play it safe rather than adopt explicit stances. But as India’s former foreign secretary, Vijay Gokhale, declared during the 2019 Raisina Dialogue, “India has moved on from its non-aligned past. India is today an aligned state.” </p>
<p> After Six Years in Office, Modi’s House of Cards Shakes at the Foundations </p>
<p> READ MORE </p>
<p> What then explains New Delhi’s sudden return to NAM? Timing. A new Cold War has emerged amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, with China and the United States engulfed in a bitter tussle, emboldening middle powers such as India, the European Union, Japan, South Korea and Australia to navigate between the major world powers. As Professor Harsh Pant, the director of the Strategic Studies program at King’s College London, states, the friction between US and China “has opened up space for middle powers to show that they can provide some stability.” </p>
<p> Sensing a global leadership vacuum, India massively stepped up its diplomatic act and adopted an approach of global solidarity and cooperation, leading virtual summits with regional and multilateral groupings, sending consignments of drugs to over 120 countries and evacuating stranded nationals of neighboring countries. Amid a shake-up of the current global order and diminishing international cooperation, New Delhi sees an opportunity in shaping an emerging world order and its institutions, and it wants its voice to be heard loud and clear. </p>
<p> In his NAM address, Modi reiterated “the limitations of the existing international order, and the need for a new template of globalization based on fairness, equality and humanity.” Modi’s words reflect a greater ambition guided by a pragmatic recognition that the world is changing. </p>
<p> Engagement </p>
<p> In recent months, India’s international image has suffered on account of its controversial revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir, nationwide protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act that culminated in riots across the country coinciding with US President Donald Trump’s visit in February, and India’s recent spat with the Gulf nations. Using all available global platforms instrumentally in this time of tectonic changes and emerging realities makes a certain sense. </p>
<p> This will aid in the pursuit of India’s interests by mobilizing support for India’s positions, reviving its positive image, highlighting regional concerns and reaching a wider audience. In fact, as Aditya Raj Kaul discusses in The Quint, given Pakistan’s serious provocations in Kashmir amidst the COVID-19 crisis, Modi drew attention to Pakistan’s habit for terrorism, likening it to a deadly virus during the virtual NAM summit. </p>
<p> While engagement with major powers remains a priority, there is no harm in leveraging avenues where India has generated considerable goodwill. Middle powers and smaller nations are gaining importance by playing a balancing role during the pandemic. Amidst a global backlash against China and a resurgence of India-China border skirmishes lies an opportune moment for New Delhi. Even with an outdated philosophy, the NAM — with 120 member states, the world’s largest grouping after the UN — can serve as a useful platform to amplify India’s voice, influence and global engagement. As Professor Manjari Chatterjee Miller, of Boston University, states, “nonalignment was never a monolithic ideology” but one “interpreted in different ways by successive leaders.” It seems that Modi has also acted on his own interpretations of it. </p>
<p> The challenge for India is to reorient and steer the NAM’s course to factor in current realities. Arun Sukumar argues for how the NAM could be reimagined in terms of economic non-alignment or neutrality in the wake of global dependence on China. He also highlights how NAM summits have often looked into issues of international law, such as addressing the South China Sea dispute. Against the backdrop of the India-China rivalry, Sukumar’s suggestions have strong resonance, as backing from NAM nations could boost India’s influence in its multilateral relationships and setting the global agenda. </p>
<p> Whether the Indian government is guided by a similar rationale, or whether Modi’s attendance at the summit was only an ad hoc means to project the Indian prime minister as a progressive globalist and set him apart from other rightwing populist leaders, remains to be seen. Ultimately, India’s foreign policy successes are contingent not on attending summits for the sake of attending, but in making conscious choices and pursuing them with a consistent and long-term vision. </p>

<p> Political parties in Uttar Pradesh, and the Election Commission of India making themselves for the 2017 assembly elections and began basic exercises for the polls. Election Commission began informing the electoral rolls in the state for the legislature elections that would be held for 403 seats in all assembly segments. </p>
<p> Number of seats in the assembly </p>
<p> Currently, the ruling Samajwadi Party has 229 seats in the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly, while the opposition Bahujan Samaj Party has 79, Bharatiya Janata Party has 41, and Congress has 29 seats. Apart from 403 seats, one seat for an Anglo-Indian is reserved. </p>
<p> The BJP divided Uttar Pradesh into five regions for election agitation and proclaimed that its top leaders would hold at least four rallies in every region. BJP intentions to woo people from all backgrounds, castes, and religions; district heads from backward sections were chosen to please backward vote bank. According to reports, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is planned to address over ten rallies in the state. </p>
<p> BSP's plan to return to power </p>
<p> In May'16, BSP Chief Mayawati proclaimed that her party would support Congress and not BJP in the imminent UP elections. Hoping to make a comeback in the state, BSP announced support to Congress significantly because of the Muslim vote bank of the Congress. </p>
<p> The party created religion/caste-based groups to reach out to people and made it clear to have the support of Muslims and Dalits. </p>
<p> Samajwadi Party's plan to retain power </p>
<p> Ruling Samajwadi Party has an on-going plan for 2017 political polls and launched 'Mission 2017' to make people aware of its schemes and counter BJP's effect. In Mar'16, SP proclaimed a list of 143 candidates for the polls. Though the polls were more than a year away, SP didn't abstain from looking for the right candidates keeping class/religion/caste in mind and positioning funds for campaigning. </p>
<p> Congress' women against other tough candidates </p>
<p> With polls only a year away, Congress seemed to be in a quandary whether to look for associations or project a contender for the chief minister post. However, the party deliberate an approach to counterattack giants from other parties in the elections. Congress decided to place women against strong candidates from other parties; Priyanka Gandhi Vadra was predictable to take the charge in UP. </p>

He also said that the remarks of Sonia Gandhi on Modi are absolutely deplorable. </p>
<p> In her statement, covering her Son in Law Robert Vadra and her family and also drawing attentions towards drought and poverty in India, Congress President Sonia Gandhi has called Modi, a ‘Shahenshah’ and considered the celebration by BJP totally unethical. </p>
<p> The party has failed to understand emerging trends in Indian politics Now, Robert Vadra has been found having links with Arms dealer Sanjay Bhandari in an Income Tax raid but the lawyers of Vadra are denying the charges.

<p> The budget session has ended in the cabinet but is very sad, that the landmark goods and services tax bill has not passed. This was the main bill which had to pass at any cost. Why? Because it is pending for a very long time now. Prime Minister Narendre Modi is not feeling good at all about this and he said that it was very important and it should have been passed during this session. </p>
<p> Indian politics news today is that PM Narendre Modi lamented the rajya sabha during its last session, for not approving the biggest bill. Referring to the GST Bill pm said that Bihar and Uttar Pradesh would have got profits from it to a great level, also many other states of the country. In total, leaving only a few all states of the country would have received many kinds of benefits from it, if it would have passed. Lok Sabha has already approved this bill long ago but it is now pending from Rajya Sabha’s end. </p>
<p> Looking at the present scenario, PM said that now they will have to 4-5 months which is very dreadful. He also addressed to the 53 MPs who got retired recently and bid a farewell to them. Indian politics news today is that Prime Minister Narendre Modi expressed his obligation and gratefulness to these 53 retiring MPs and said that these people have seen two governments in their entire 60 years of tenure here. He said that the both the governments benefited from their knowledge and experience. This government, BJP benefited less, the previous one Congress benefited more.

<p> Don’t Compare Modi to Trump </p>
<p> Comparing two political personalities from two completely different nations is a herculean task. </p>
<p> Narendra Modi was a tea-seller before he became India’s prime minister. This is exactly why his journey to success is admired by many Indians. So in India, a nation that hasn’t even completed 100 years of independence and is still reeling from issues such as poverty and corruption, it is not difficult to understand why Modi is a celebrity. </p>
<p> Modi’s ideologue, which centers around right-wing ideas, partly owing to his old association with the Hindu nationalist group the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has often drawn parallels with the rhetoric of Donald Trump. The US president is an anti-globalization, anti-immigrant believer, which made him an instant hit with working-class white people in America who felt deprived and underrepresented by previous administrations. </p>
<p> In the run-up to the US election, comparisons were made between Trump, Modi and even Vladimir Putin. What needs to be understood is whether these parallels can be drawn between two political figures that come from vastly different backgrounds but may have some common political rhetoric. </p>
<p> Let’s start with the similarities. </p>
<p> First, since 2016, the Modi government has tried to pass an amendment to the Citizenship Bill, which will now have this provision: “[P]ersons belonging to minority communities, namely, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan … shall not be treated as illegal migrants for the purposes of this Act.” The government clearly excluded Muslim refugees from the list, leaving the Rohingya of Myanmar fleeing from violence finding their doors to India closed. </p>
<p> Trump, on the other hand, rose on the populist agenda of Islamophobia. One of his first moves as president was to temporarily ban people from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States. He has also suggested including other countries to the list, and India under Modi is more than happy to add Pakistan to it. </p>
<p> Second, Modi and Trump are both very strong-headed, and their administrations flex their knuckles whenever a decision doesn’t go their way. Take, for example, Modi’s sudden implementation of demonetization and Trump’s blatant attack on environmentalism and removal of federal funding for organizations that perform or support abortion. Both have extreme views in certain matters and have made sure others comply with their policies. </p>
<p> But what about the differences? </p>
<p> Trade and globalization </p>
<p> While Trump intends to put “America first” and protect US jobs by slowing immigration, Modi seems to be opening India’s doors to foreign trade and investment. In 2016, when British Prime Minister Theresa May visited India and offered lighter visa regulations for wealthy Indians, Modi took a stand and insisted Indian students should receive the right to work in the United Kingdom after graduating. Under Modi, foreign direct investment in India has reached $40 billion, and his flagship Make in India program is encouraging investment in certain crucial sectors like defense and the automotive industry, albeit with some controversy. </p>
<p> Trump has already scrapped the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), and intends to amend the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico, to protect American jobs. His plan to build a border wall with Mexico could cost America $15 billion. He also plans to crack down on H1B work visas and on students seeking to stay in the US after completing their degree. </p>
<p> Modi, despite his right-wing politics, is still looking to open up India to the world, unlike Trump who is sneaking into his own shell. </p>
<p> Views toward women </p>
<p> Prime Minister Modi has been trying to bridge the gender divide (again, controversially), through schemes such as Beti Bachao Beti Padhao (Save the Girl Child, Educate Her), which intends to increase enrollment at the secondary level in schools from 73% to 76%. Haryana, the state with the worst female child to male child birth ratio, has seen the number of girls attending school rise. Till now, no allegations have been heaped on Modi with regard to his behavior toward women. </p>
<p> Trump is a different story. On the campaign trail, the former reality-TV star bewildered the world when a video of him passing lewd comments about women went viral. He is known to hold bigoted views over gender equality and the rights of women. His stance on women’s reproductive rights also makes him controversial — yet another department where Modi is different from him, for he hasn’t yet presented any opinion on the matter. </p>
<p> Their background </p>
<p> Modi belongs to the other backward class in India and grew up in a lower-middle-class household. He used to sell tea at a train station to earn his living and still struggles to communicate in English, preferring to use Hindi instead. Trump, on the other hand, grew up in a wealthy family, studied at the University of Pennsylvania, and inherited a fortune and a business empire. </p>
<p> With zero experience in politics, Trump is an outsider. Modi, however, was the chief minister of the state of Gujarat before he became prime minister. </p>
<p> Focus on religion </p>
<p> What makes Modi most controversial is his links to the 2002 Godhra riots, when thousands of Hindus and Muslims died in three days of communal violence after a train of Hindu pilgrims was burned down in Gujarat. While Modi’s involvement in the incident has not been proved, it is necessary to note certain people in his administration and in Bharatiya Janata Party-controlled states are still alleged to pass divisive statements. </p>
<p> Trump’s appeal to Christian voters, owing to his stance on abortion, may have gained him followers, but the US president doesn’t base his ideas on religion. He has his biases toward Muslims, but till now his administration hasn’t undertaken any strategy that divides people communally or incites violence. Of course, America could see easily a rise in tension over race or religion, particularly with police brutality. Remember Ferguson? </p>
<p> Comparing two personalities from two completely different nations is a herculean task. India and the US are very different countries, even if they are the world’s largest democracies. While similarities may exist between Trump and Modi, whether their political ideas can encourage increased cooperation between them seems like a farfetched assumption. Only time will tell if India’s expansionism and Trump’s protectionism can come to a plausible conclusion. </p>

<p> Former Vice President Mike Pence has unveiled a new policy platform for Republicans ahead of this year's midterms elections, offering a framework for candidates — and possibly himself — ahead of a potential 2024 presidential run. Pence’s “Freedom Agenda," released Thursday, combines traditional Republican goals like increasing American energy production, cutting taxes and rolling back regulations with priorities pursued by former President Donald Trump on issues like trade and immigration. Pence also offers plenty of culture war red meat for the GOP base, pledging, for instance, to save women's sports by “ensuring that sports competitions are between those who share their God-given gender" and calling for all high school students to pass a civics test. </p>

<p> Retired union leader Jerry Dias under investigation for allegedly breaching Unifor constitution, union says </p>
<p> Jerry Dias — the longtime head of Canada’s largest private sector union who retired just days ago — has been under investigation since the end of January for allegedly breaching his union’s constitution. </p>
<p> A statement from Unifor issued Monday said that the union received a written complaint alleging that Dias “engaged in an alleged breach of the Unifor Constitution.” </p>
<p> “In order to ensure the integrity of the ongoing investigation and to maintain confidentiality in accordance with the Unifor Constitution, specifics of the complaint will not be divulged at this time,” the statement said. </p>
<p> After receiving the complaint, Unifor national secretary-treasurer Lana Payne initiated an independent external investigation. </p>
<p> Dias was first notified of the investigation on January 29. He announced that he was taking medical leave on Feb. 6. On March 11, Dias cited health issues as he announced his retirement. </p>
<p> Dias had said he would retire in August after his third term as national president. In a statement released by Unifor on Sunday, he was quoted as saying he felt the union was in good hands. </p>
<p> “After eight and a half years I can proudly say we have built an incredible organization and made Unifor the influential and successful union it is today,” Dias said in the statement. </p>
<p> “I have all the confidence the leadership, staff and locals will continue to build Unifor into a bold and progressive force for working people from coast to coast to coast.” </p>
<p> In that same statement, Payne thanked Dias for his work — giving no hint of an investigation into the former president’s actions. </p>
<p> “On behalf of our members and our leadership team, we wish Jerry well and thank him for his numerous and impactful contributions to working people over many years, from his days representing aerospace workers on the shop floor to national president of Canada’s largest private sector union,” said Payne. </p>
<p> The Unifor board is expected to meet in the coming days to decide on next steps for the leadership of the union, which represents 315,000 workers. </p>
<p> Two people already have announced bids for the national presidency: Unifor Local 444 president Dave Cassidy and Scott Doherty, Dias’ executive assistant. </p>

<p> Shanghai-headquartered Wingtech Technologies warned shareholders in a note this week that "domestic and foreign industry policies" present a risk to the takeover of Newport Wafer Fab, which is located in South Wales. The news was first reported by The Telegraph newspaper. </p>
<p> The warning comes after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered Stephen Lovegrove, the U.K.'s national security advisor, to investigate the deal. A decision could be announced in the coming days. </p>

<p> UK: Parliament Set To Approve December Election With Labour Party Backing </p>
<p> [world politics news] </p>
<p> The UK looks set for a December general election after Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced his party was dropping it's opposition to an early evening and is ready to fight the "most radical campaign ever." Corbyn said his condition of taking a no-deal Brexit off the table had now been met after the EU agreed to extend the deadline until January 31, 2020. Prime Minister Boris Johnson can only hold an election with the support of MPs - who have blocked it three times.

<p> UK: PM Johnson Signals Vaccine Passport Coming For Int'l Travel, Labour Party, Pubs, Oppose </p>
<p> Prime Minister Boris Johnson has delivered his strongest hint yet that British citizens will need a vaccine passport to go on holidays abroad as he faces a Labour Party revolt - and one in his own Conservative Party, too - over the documents being used domestically. </p>
<p> The Prime Minister said during a visit to Middlesbrough that there is 'definitely going to be a world in which international travel will use vaccine passports'. </p>
<p> He insisted 'there's a logic' to such an approach on travel as he also said proof of vaccination and having had a test could help provide 'maximum confidence to businesses and customers in the UK'. </p>
<p> The latter comment is likely to be viewed as a sign that the Government does intend to proceed with some sort of domestic 'Covid status certification' which could be used to determine access to things like hospitality venues. Pubs have warned that they do not support this move, however. </p>

<p> National archive documents raise questions about how definitive British efforts to prevent arms transfers to Iran really were after the revolution that toppled the Shah. </p>
<p> You ask a question, call for a particular action and express solidarity with the person who represents you in parliament. </p>
<p> The ‘world of superlatives’ occupied by Waugh and the Bright Young Things is alive and well today in Westminster. </p>
<p> Whether Boris Johnson’s wife did something wrong can be debated – but placing her at the centre of the ‘partygate’ story is to let the Prime Minister off the hook. </p>
<p> In the UK, there is very little to stop a leader who doesn’t care to comply with unwritten norms. </p>
<p> The types of people who gathered daily to watch Neighbours are the same who backed Tony Blair in 1997. </p>
<p> More city region mayors are part of the government’s plan to level up, but the short timeline could hinder their success. </p>
<p> Garret Martin, American University School of International Service </p>
<p> Why will calling someone a liar get you thrown out of the UK parliamentary debates, but using defamatory language might not? </p>
<p> The prime minister seized on Sue Gray’s warnings about structural problems in government, avoiding the bigger ethical questions raised by her report. </p>
<p> Sue Gray’s “update” reveals that 16 separate incidents have been investigated as part of inquiries into the behaviour of government staff during pandemic lockdowns. </p>
<p> Boris Johnson continues to insist the public cares more that he ‘gets on with the job’ than what happened in Downing Street over lockdown. But he may be wrong. </p>
<p> Recent allegations suggest the line towards blackmail has been breached too frequently, and MPs are no longer afraid to speak out. </p>
<p> Sue Gray won’t rule on whether the prime minister has broken the law but her report could triggers a vote of no confidence in his leadership. </p>
<p> First uttered by Oliver Cromwell, the words David Davis used to ask Boris Johnson to step down have a storied past. </p>
<p> For all the public anger over the ‘Partygate’ scandal, Johnson’s weakened position owes much to the aftershocks of Brexit. </p>
<p> The investigation into Downing Street parties has no power to bring the Prime Minister down. But it may still provide the ammunition that brings Boris Johnson’s government to an end. </p>

<p> #USA: Biden Announces Partnership With UK, Australia, To Share Tech, Counter China </p>
<p> [world politics news] </p>
<p> Pres. Joe Biden has announced a new working group with Britain and Australia to share advanced technologies — including the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines by Canberra — in a thinly veiled bid to counter China, four U.S. officials said. </p>
<p> The trio, which will be known by the acronym AUKUS, will make it easier for the three countries to share information and know-how in key technological areas like artificial intelligence, cyber, quantum, underwater systems, and long-range strike capabilities. </p>
<p> Missing from the group are Canada and New Zealand, team members with the others in the "Five Eyes" technology organization designed to keep an eye on China and its expansionist agenda. </p>

<p> On Thursday, contentious BJP leader Sangeet Som required a ban on the screening of the riot-themed movie Shorgul in Muzaffarnagar. </p>
<p> Som, who has been under the scanner for his supposed role in the Muzaffarnagar uprisings, claimed that numerous political leaders had been depicted in a precisely improper manner in the film. </p>
<p> The release date for the approaching film Shorgul has been deferred by a week and it will now hit the screens on 1 July instead of 24 June. </p>
<p> The motion picture traces upon grave topics that have leaked in the recent past such as Muzaffarnagar, Godhra, Babri Masjid riots. It also makes allusions to official misdoings, mind games and debatable master strokes of some high profile personages. </p>
<p> Police officers in the state have been put on alert, IG Sujit Pandey said, and added that the law and order situation will not be permitted to worsen. Meanwhile, the possessor of a movie theatre, Deepak Seth, said that the picture could be screened only if police and administration make passable security preparations. </p>

<p> We all are hearing about attacks on African nationals and it’s a disgrace not only to the law and order but the whole nation. Rising crimes in Delhi has put an ugly image of the city in the whole world. Recently a statement by Lalu Prasad Yadav made us think. </p>
<p> Latest political headlines in India was about Former Bihar CM, Lalu Prasad Yadav who has claimed that BJP is defaming Bihar by calling it ‘JungleRaj’ and questioned why BJP is not able to see the increasing crimes in Delhi where African nationals are getting openly murdered. </p>

If the tourists are not safe even in the capital of India then calling ‘JungleRaj’ in other states does not seem justified. Before questioning other politicians BJP should look into their city and the situation of law and order. </p>

<p> In a coordinated action, German authorities are cracking down on online hate speech directed at politicians by conducting searches and interrogating more than 100 suspects across Germany, the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) said. </p>
<p> The criminal offences were related to insults against nationally known politicians. Other "hate postings" contained misleading fake news and misquotes that “appear suitable for defaming and discrediting the people concerned,” the BKA noted. Two in three victims of online hate speech were female politicians.

<p> Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was given a rude welcome by several members of the European Parliament this week. </p>
<p> During a session of the European Parliament in Brussels, several MEPs called Trudeau out, accusing him of violating human rights over the handling of the Freedom Convoy protest in Ottawa last month. </p>
<p> In one speech that has gone viral online, MEP Mislav Kolakusic of Croatia criticized Canada’s leader, stating, “There are those among us who trample on those fundamental values,” a reference to some protesters’ controversial encounter with police horses near Parliament Hill. </p>
<p> Christine Anderson, a member of Parliament from Germany, also rose to condemn Trudeau, saying, "You're a disgrace to any democracy." </p>
<p> French MEP Virginie Joron not only spoke, but wore a sweater honoring American and Canadian truckers who participated in the truck convoys in both countries. </p>

<p> She originally competed in the male division before racing against women after she transitioned. </p>
<p> Rival Reka Gyorgy complained to the athletics association about its decision to let Lia race against "biological women", and this complaint has been shared by a number of athletes and experts. </p>

<p> New Democratic Party has entered into a confidence-and-supply agreement with the ruling Liberal Party to support its legislation and vote "yes" in any no confidence votes for the next three years, in exchange for Liberals pushing through NDP legislation and programs. </p>
<p> NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh says he would be willing to pull out of the new deal if it doesn't work as planned, but he said that he is confident his party can secure the social programs and other policies Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has promised to implement in their accord. </p>
<p> “We’re not going to let the Liberal government off the hook,” Singh told reporters near Parliament Hill on Tuesday, shortly after details of the Liberal-NDP deal were published. </p>
<p> Despite campaigning in the past two elections with rhetoric that attacked Trudeau as untrustworthy and beholden to corporate interests, Singh said he has faith the Liberals will abide by the deal, which is now a public document that Singh described as a new tool for New Democrats to secure their policy priorities in Canada’s minority Parliament. </p>

<p> The 2016 “Are You Serious?” Awards </p>
<p> Last year’s lowlights from world politics, the culture wars and the military-industrial complex. </p>
<p> Each year, Conn Hallinan gives awards to individuals, companies and governments that make reading the news a daily adventure. Here are the awards for 2016. </p>
<p> The Golden Lemon Award </p>
<p> The Golden Lemon Award had a number of strong contenders in 2016, including: </p>
<p> 1) General Atomics for its MQ-9 Reaper armed drone, which has a faulty starter-generator that routinely shorts out the aircraft. So far, no one can figure out why. Some 20 were either destroyed or sustained major damage in 2015. The Reapers costs $64 million apiece. </p>
<p> 2) Panavia Aircraft Company’s $25 billion Tornado fighter-bomber that can’t fly at night because the cockpit lights blind the pilot. A runner up here is the German arms company Heckler & Koch, whose G-36 assault rifle can’t shoot straight when the weather is hot. </p>
<p> 3) The British company BAE’s $1.26 billion Type 45 destroyer that breaks down “whenever we try to do too much with them,” a Royal Navy officer told the Financial Times. Engaging in combat, he said, would be “catastrophic.” </p>
<p> But the hands down winner is Lockheed Martin, builder of the F-35 Lightning stealth fighter. At a cost of $1.5 trillion, it’s the most expensive weapons system in US history. </p>
<p> Aside from numerous software problems, pilots who try to bail out risk decapitation. The director of operational test and evaluation recently released an assessment of the F-35’s performance that states, “In an opposed combat scenario,” the “aircraft would need to avoid threat engagement and would require augmentation by other friendly forces.” </p>
<p> Translation: “If the bad guys show up, run for your life and pray your buddies arrive to bail you out of trouble.” </p>
<p> Lockheed Martin also gets an Honorable Mention for its $4.4 billion littoral combat ship, the USS Zumwalt, which had to be towed out of the Panama Canal. The ship also leaks, as do other sister littoral combat ships, including the USS Freedom. </p>
<p> Note: US students are currently $1.3 trillion in debt. </p>
<p> The Dr. Frankenstein Award </p>
<p> The Dr. Frankenstein Award to the US Air Force for zapping the brains of drone operators with electricity in order to improve their focus. </p>
<p> The electrical stimulation was started after scientists discovered that feeding the pilots Provigil and Ritalin was a bad idea, because both drugs are highly addictive and Provigil can permanently damage sleep patterns. </p>
<p> Nika Knight of Common Dreams reports that “European researchers who studied the brain-zapping technique years ago warned that the technology is, in fact, extremely invasive, as its effects tend to ‘spread from the target brain area to neighboring areas.’” </p>
<p> The Golden Jackal Award </p>
<p> The Golden Jackal Award goes to United Kingdom oil companies BP and Royal Dutch Shell for their lobbying campaign following the US invasion of Iraq. Executives of the companies met with UK Trade Minister Baroness Elizabeth Symons five months before the US attack to complain that the Americans were cutting them out of the post-war loot. </p>
<p> According to Parliament’s 2016 Chilcot Report on the Iraq War, Symons then met with Prime Minister Tony Blair’s foreign secretary, Jack Straw, to tell him it was a “matter of urgency,” and that “British interests are being left to one side.” Straw dutifully told Blair to raise the issue “very forcefully” with President George W. Bush, because US companies are “ruthless” and “will not help UK companies unless you play hardball with Bush.” </p>
<p> Runner up in this category is The Washington Post, which won a Pulitzer Prize in Public Service journalism for publishing Edward Snowden’s revelations about illegal US wiretapping and then called for the whistleblower himself to be charged with espionage. </p>
<p> Glenn Greenwald—who met with Snowden and wrote stories about the scandal for The Guardian—summed it up: “The Washington Post has achieved an ignominious feat in US media history: the first-ever paper to explicitly editorialize for the criminal prosecution of its own source … That is warped beyond anything that can be described.” </p>
<p> The Thin Skin Award </p>
<p> The Thin Skin Award is a five-way tie among the governments of Spain, India, Israel, Turkey and Thailand: </p>
<p> Spain: Under Spain’s 2015 public security law—nicknamed the “gag rule”—police are trying to fine a woman for carrying a bag on which was written “All Cats Are Beautiful.” The police say that the writing and color of the bag is “traditionally associated with insults to the police” and that the four capital letters really mean “All Cops Are Bastards.” </p>
<p> India: The right-wing government of Narendra Modi is proposing a law that would make it illegal to publish any map indicating that Kashmir is disputed territory divided between India and Pakistan. Currently, such maps are censored by either preventing the publication’s distribution or covering the maps with black stickers. The new law would fine violators $15 million and jail them for up to seven years. </p>
<p> Israel: The Ministry of Education has removed a novel—Borderlife by Dorit Rabinyan, about a romance between a Jewish woman and a Palestinian man—from the list of required reading for Hebrew high schools literature classes. Education official Dalia Fenig says, “Marrying a non-Jew is not what the education system is educating about.” </p>
<p> Turkey: In the aftermath of a failed coup in July 2016, novelist and journalist Ahmet Alten and his brother Mehmet, a professor of economics, were arrested for “colluding with the military” even though both men are known to be sharp critics of the Turkish armed forces. The prosecutor had no evidence against the men, but charged them with giving “subliminal” and “subconscious” messages backing the coup during a TV talk show. </p>
<p> The authorities also closed down the Smurfs, Maya the Bee and SpongeBob SquarePants, because the cartoon characters were speaking Kurdish on Zarok TV, a station that does programming in the Kurdish language. According to Al-Monitor, “Many social media users went into lampoon mode, asking, ‘Who is the separatist: SpongeBob or Papa Smurf?’” </p>
<p> Thailand: Patnaree Chankij, a 40-year-old maid, is to be tried by a military court for breaking the country’s lèse-majesté law that makes it a crime to insult the royal family or their pets. She replied “ja” (“yeah”) to a private post sent to her on Facebook. She did not agree with the post, comment on it or make it public. One man is currently serving a 30-year sentence for posting material critical of the Thai royal family. </p>
<p> Following the military coup two years ago, the authorities have filed 57 such cases, 44 of them for online commentary. One person was arrested for insulting the king’s dog. </p>
<p> The Cultural Sensitivity Award </p>
<p> The Cultural Sensitivity Award goes to Denmark, France and Latvia. </p>
<p> The center-right Danish government, which relies on the racist Danish People’s Party to stay in government, passed a law in 2016 that confiscates valuables, including jewels and cash, from refugees. Immigrants can only keep up to $1,455. </p>
<p> The Danish town of Randers also required pork to be used in all public day care centers and kindergartens in a measure the Socialist People’s Party (SPP) charges is aimed at Muslims. “What do children need? Do they need pork? Actually not,” said Charlotte Molbaek, a Randers Town Council member from the SPP. “Children need grownups.” </p>
<p> Several French towns run by right-wing mayors have removed alternatives—like fish or chicken—from school menus when pork is served. On those days, Muslim and Jewish children eat vegetables. </p>
<p> The right-wing government of Latvia is banning the wearing of full veils, in spite of that fact that, at last count, there were three such women in the whole country. Former Latvian President Vaira Vike-Freiberga told The New York Times, “Anybody could be under a veil or under a burqa. You could carry a rocket launcher under your veil.” </p>
<p> A runner up in this category is former National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice who, during a speech in Kiev, said that Ukrainians should stop complaining about the economic crisis that has gripped the country since the 2014 coup that overthrew President Viktor Yanukovych. “Anyone who believes that life is bad in Ukraine should go to Liberia, where the standard of living is much lower, and then you will be thankful.” </p>
<p> The Head in the Sand Award </p>
<p> The Head in the Sand Award to British Prime Minister Theresa May for closing down the government’s program to study climate change. A co-winner is the conservative government of Australia, which laid off 275 scientists from its climate change program. Some were rehired after an international petition campaign, but the leading international researcher on sea levels—John Church—was let go permanently. </p>
<p> In the meantime, the US Air Force is spending $1 billion to build a radar installation in Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The atoll lies halfway between Australia and Hawaii and is only a few feet above sea level. It is estimated that sea levels will rise at least six feet by 2100, but the increase is moving far faster than scientists predicted. “The future does not look very good for those islands,” says Curt Storlazzi, an oceanographer with the US Geological Service. </p>
<p> The Little Bo Peep Award </p>
<p> The Little Bo Peep Award goes to the US Department of Defense for being unable to account for $6.5 trillion in spending. Yes, that is a “T.” </p>
<p> According to Mandy Smithberger, director of Straus Military Reform Project at the Project On Government Oversight, “Accounting at the Department of Defense is a disaster, but nobody is screaming about it because you have a lot of people in Congress who believe in more military spending.” </p>
<p> According to UK watchdog group Action on Armed Violence, the Pentagon also can’t account for 1.4 million guns it shipped to Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>
<p> The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) won some laurels in this category as well. According to an investigation by Al Jazeera and The New York Times, Jordanian intelligence operatives stole millions of dollars in US weapons bound for Syria. Some of the guns were used to kill Americans at a police training school in Amman. </p>
<p> The Annie Oakley Award </p>
<p> The Annie Oakley Award goes to American firearms manufacturers and the National Rifle Association (NRA) for their campaign to arm kids. The guns for tots are lighter than regular firearms and have less recoil. They are also made in “kid-friendly” colors, like pink. </p>
<p> Iowa recently passed legislation making it legal for any minor to own a pistol. According to State Representative Kirsten Running, the law “allows for one-year olds, two-year olds, three-year olds, four-year olds to operate handguns,” adding, “We do not need a militia of toddlers.” </p>
<p> The Violence Policy Center reports: “As household gun ownership has steadily declined and the primary gun market of white males continues to age, the firearms industry has set its sights on America’s children. Much like the tobacco industry’s search for replacement smokers, the gun industry is seeking replacement shooters.” </p>
<p> If your 2-year old is packing and really wants that Star Wars droid, I recommend you buy it. </p>
