<p> Australian star Ashleigh Gardner to miss start of World Cup with COVID-19 </p>
<p> Australia has copped a huge blow on the eve of its World Cup campaign in New Zealand with star all-rounder Ashleigh Gardner testing positive to COVID-19. </p>
<p> Gardner tested positive following a routine rapid antigen test with her result confirmed via a PCR test shortly afterwards. </p>
<p> The 24-year-old will remain in Christchurch as she isolates for the next 10 days and will be out of action for at least the first two matches of Australia's World Cup campaign. </p>
<p> Gardner will come out of isolation on March 12, a day before Australia's third World Cup match against New Zealand in Wellington. </p>
<p> Despite Gardner's positive result, the rest of Australia's squad and support staff have tested negative on their respective RATs and will travel to Hamilton this evening ahead of Saturday's World Cup opener against England. </p>
<p> The loss of Gardner is a huge one for Meg Lanning's side due to her destructive ability with both the bat and the ball. </p>
<p> The New South Wales native enjoyed a fantastic 2021 season, and was rewarded with the Belinda Clark Award for her efforts. </p>
<p> Gardner has scored 571 runs in 42 ODIs at an impressive strike rate of 113.97 and also has 43 wickets at an average of 27.02. </p>

<p> Thanasi Kokkinakis breaks seven-year ATP 1000 drought at Miami Open </p>
<p> Thanasi Kokkinakis is through to the fourth round of an ATP 1000 event for the first time in seven years, after prevailing in a tense encounter against Denis Kudla at the Miami Open. </p>
<p> Kokkinakis, now the world No.97, held his nerve in two separate tiebreakers to seal a 7-6 (5) 4-6 7-6 (4) win over America's Kudla. He will face Alexander Zverev in the next round. </p>
<p> The clash against Zverev will be Kokkinakis' first fourth-round match in an ATP 1000 event since he was beaten by fellow Australian Bernard Tomic in the fourth round of the 2015 Indian Wells Masters. </p>
<p> It continues what has been a brilliant 2022 season for Kokkinakis, after he secured his first ATP singles title at the Adelaide International, before winning the men's doubles title at the Australian Open alongside Nick Kyrgios. </p>
<p> Kokkinakis has already tallied 11 ATP main draw wins so far in 2022, after managing just 14 total wins in the previous six years. </p>
<p> Kyrgios, who is also in the fourth round and has a match-up against Jannik Sinner on deck, could not hide his excitement for his great friend. </p>
<p> "Now he's finally a happy person," Kyrgios said of Kokkinakis. </p>
<p> "He's had some really bad years where he felt uncomfortable because of all the injuries. Now everything is going right and I think he deserves all his current happiness." </p>

<p> live feed </p>
<p> Josh Papalii has defeated Ben Hannant via unanimous decision, but not without some controversy. </p>
<p> It was a commendable bout from the two big-men who showed some decent ring-craft to put on a show in Townsville. </p>
<p> While it was heavy slugging from both Hannant and Papalii, the pair impressed with some sound striking and counter-punching. </p>
<p> In some controversy, Papalii was awarded the fight via unanimous decision despite the crowd heavily leaning in favour of the Broncos premiership winner, and the Raider made a classy gesture for Hannant during his victory speech. </p>
<p> "He just kept coming and to be honest I think the crowd was leaning the blue (corner) way, and so was I," Papalii said. </p>
<p> "That was Benny's fight, and I'm just going to get back to another 9-week camp. </p>
<p> "He should have (won the fight), I'm not going to sit here and be biased. He came in with three-four weeks preparation and my hat goes off to him. I'm just glad I wore the headgear tonight." </p>
<p> Hannant was equally gracious in defeat and had some kind words to share for Papalii. </p>
<p> "It's such BS when people tell you you can't do anything, it shows you if you work hard you can do anything," Hannant said. </p>
<p> "Josh Papallli is an absolute champion on-and-off the field. Tonight I was a bit unlucky but I was lucky enough to be in the ring with the best prop in the world - let's do it again Papa." </p>
<p> Probably some of the best boxing we've seen from anyone tonight as he sees his way through a first-round slugfest from Neville Costigan, to down the former rugby league player with a brutal combination in the second round. </p>
<p> It's was a scary flurry from Paulo who kept his cool and picked his moment to unload, sending Costigan to the canvas. </p>
<p> Costigan managed to get to his feet but the referee had seen enough, calling an end to the fight via TKO. </p>
<p> Big Willie Mason has defeated Sam Thaiday via split decision. </p>
<p> It was a messy yet entertaining affair between the two big units who traded wildly across three rounds. </p>
<p> In the end, it was Mason's reach that got him across the line as he landed just a few more clean shots to the head of Thaiday. </p>
<p> "I signed that contract to get punched in the head, and I did," Mason said after the win </p>
<p> "I didn't come in here thinking I was Ali or anything like that. </p>
<p> "I know Sammy is a hometown boy but it could have gone either way." </p>
<p> Following the clash, the big man was straight on the beers! </p>
<p> Former NRL star Sandor Earl has defeated Queensland great Justin Hodges via unanimous decision. </p>
<p> It was a slugfest from the two big boys who were swinging for the fences from the first bell. </p>
<p> But it was Earl who looked the sharper, making some calculated moves amid the madness to get the better of Hodges by the final bell. </p>
<p> A smart first-round knockdown also went a way to help the judges tip this one in Earl's favour. </p>
<p> Following the fight, Earl revealed he was eager to make a run on the Australian boxing circuit and joked about calling out Sharks legend and boxer Paul Gallen. </p>
<p> "I've fallen in love with the sport over just six weeks," he told Gordon Tallis immediately after the fight. </p>
<p> "What am I doing? Am I calling out Gallen? What am I doing?" </p>
<p> Craig Gower has defeated North Queensland great Matt Bowen via a controversial split decision. </p>
<p> Gower started with the most intent early when he came out swinging for the fences looking for an early knockout. </p>
<p> It was a full-on assault but with little substance as Bowen soon found his feet and began some impressive evasion and counter punches. </p>
<p> Bowen looked the better boxer across the three rounds, and when Gower began to gas midway through the second round, the former Cowboy came to the fore. </p>
<p> Some "slick" lefts found their way through and caused some damage on Gower's nose, but by the final bell the aggression from Gower would get him across the line. </p>
<p> "I'm not going to say anything more about the judging tonight, but I dont know what they're looking at," former boxer and rugby league player Garth Wood said in commentary. </p>
<p> "Matt Bowen was the better boxer in there tonight - the fight was won by Matty Bowen." </p>
<p> Smart boxing from Bowen but not enough to get it done tonight. </p>
<p> North Queensland Cowboys great Scott Prince and former NRL bad boy Todd Carney have fought out a majority draw to kick off the All Stars Footy Rivals Fight Night. </p>
<p> It was a decent knock from the two former rugby league stars who fought a far more composed fight than many were expecting as they did the dance over three rounds. </p>
<p> Carney started fast, catching Prince with some wild striking in the first round. Prince went to ground but upon replay, it was obvious he had slipped and not been sent to the canvas by Carney. </p>
<p> "It amazes me that on an amateur night like tonight, the judges still can't get it right," Aussie boxing legend Jeff Fenech said. </p>
<p> Prince came back hard in the remaining two rounds, fighting well (despite his 9kg weight difference) to get the better of Carney and score often off a solid jab. </p>

<p> Aslan Karatsev has been crowned champion of the men's Sydney Tennis Classic singles final. </p>
<p> The Russian cruised to a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Briton Andy Murray. </p>

<p> The 25-year-old downed his rival 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 to win his first title on the ATP circuit – and it's clear just how much it means to him as he shouts in triumph and breaks down in tears. </p>
<p> Former British tennis player Mark Petchey labelled it "raw emotion" on Nine's Wide World of Sports coverage. </p>
<p> Kokkinakis' luckless history with injuries is undoubtedly a major fuel source of his emotional reaction. </p>

<p> The question that made 'Captain Grumpy' tear up as cricket greats pay tribute to Shane Warne </p>
<p> Australian cricket legend Allan Border was known for his gruff on-field persona, earning the nickname 'Captain Grumpy' for the trait. </p>
<p> But on Wednesday night at the MCG one of the hardest men to grace a field was brought to the verge of tears by one question. </p>
<p> Border sat on stage alongside fellow cricket greats Mark Taylor, Nasser Hussain, Merv Hughes, and Brian Lara. </p>
<p> When the panel were introduced by Mark Howard, Border was visibly emotional. </p>
<p> He quipped he would "rather be out there (on the MCG wicket) facing (West Indies fast bowler legend) Curtly Ambrose". </p>
<p> At the end of their segment, Howard turned to Border and asked - "what would you say to Warnie if he was here right now?". </p>
<p> Border teared up as he gave his response. </p>
<p> "Thankyou for making my captaincy... it revitalised my captaincy towards the end of my time," Border said. </p>
<p> "I was lucky to have two years with Shane, and I'd just thank him for that." </p>
<p> Border was Warne's first captain at Test level, and he was followed by Mark Taylor in the job. </p>
<p> The day Warne bamboozled Nasser </p>
<p> Taylor was also asked what he would say to Warne now. </p>
<p> "He made slow bowling fashionable again, he made it cool," Taylor said. </p>
<p> "It made AB (Border) and I in particular, because we captained him, we appreciated it because it made us better captains and better leaders." </p>
<p> West Indies batting legend Brian Lara remembered playing golf with Warne as friends. </p>
<p> "I'd always been in a rush to get out of Shane's Ferrari after a game of golf," Lara recalled. </p>
<p> "But this time I'd stop and I'd look back, and I'd say 'you are the greatest Australian that I know, and I cherish our friendship, and I've always been honoured to be in your presence'." </p>
<p> Keith Warne on his son's 'greatest achievement' </p>
<p> Former England captain Nasser Hussain is adamant Warne was the best bowler to ever play cricket. </p>
<p> "It was an absolute privilige to be on a cricket field with you," Hussain said of his late friend. </p>
<p> "You were the greatest bowler I ever saw, and in the last 10 years it's been an absolute privilege to share a comm-box with you and call you a friend. </p>
<p> "We love ya, and we'll miss you." </p>

<p> Aussie golfer Cameron Smith eyeing No.1 ranking after Players Championship triumph </p>
<p> Australian golfer Cameron Smith says becoming the top-ranked player in the world is a realistic goal after his win at the Players Championship. </p>
<p> He also has his sights set on usurping America's Scottie Schefffler as the No.1 player in the world. </p>
<p> "I feel like it's a realistic goal now," Smith told 9News Queensland. </p>
<p> "The way I've been playing has been the best in my career. I feel like if I keep working hard it's definitely in reach." </p>
<p> Smith's next big task is at Augusta when he takes part at the Masters, a course where only one Australian has won: Adam Scott in 2013. </p>
<p> The Queensland native has notched two consecutive top-10 finishes, including a runner-up showing in 2020, and believes Australia's next Masters win is not far off. </p>
<p> "There's definitely a bit of noise throughout Aussie media with, 'Is this going to be the year?', but I feel like our time's going to come soon," Smith said. </p>
<p> "It's a place that I've performed well at before. I feel really comfortable around there, it reminds me a lot of home. </p>
<p> "You get the occasional Queenslander in the crowd still over here yelling 'Queenslander' out at you, and I just love wearing (the maroon)." </p>

<p> This past Saturday at Bare Knuckle FC 6, Artem Lobov pulled off a stunning upset win over former boxing champion Paulie Malignaggi in the headliner. It was one of the most anticipated fights of the year in all of combat sports, simply because of the boiling hot feud between Lobov and Malignaggi heading into the event. </p>

<p> Artem Lobov’s gameplan was pretty simple against Paulie Malignaggi at Bare Knuckle FC 6: Clinch, clinch, and more clinch. He wasn’t going to be dumb enough to stand in the pocket and trade all night with a former two-weight world boxing champion. </p>

<p> As the top of the table clash dominated Eastern Conference action, the Los Angeles Lakers slid out of Western Conference post-season position with an embarrassing 128-110 loss to the Mavericks in Dallas. </p>
<p> With LeBron James and Anthony Davis sidelined by injury, the Lakers trailed by a shocking 82-56 at halftime. </p>
<p> It was the second-most first-half points allowed by the Lakers in franchise history -- after the 83 conceded to the Celtics in 1959. </p>
<p> "Not good enough in any way," was Lakers coach Frank Vogel's assessment after watching Mavs star Luka Doncic ride roughshod over his players. </p>
<p> Doncic scored 34 points with 12 rebounds and 12 assists, posting his 10th triple-double of the season. </p>
<p> Doncic said the Mavs knew they needed a quick start against the Lakers, who with seven games remaining are fighting just to get into the play-in tournament for teams in seventh through 10th place. </p>
<p> "They're fighting for the playoffs so we had to get out with aggressiveness and energy," he said. </p>
<p> Meanwhile the Bucks and Sixers continued their battle for position in the East in a game that came down to the wire. </p>
<p> James Harden scored 32 points and grabbed nine rebounds for Philadelphia and Embiid shook off a slow start to score 29 points with 14 rebounds and seven assists. </p>
<p> Down by as many as 11 in the first quarter, the 76ers led by 10 at halftime and by 14 in the third quarter. </p>
<p> But the Bucks took control in the fourth, opening the final period on a 13-4 scoring run and taking a 94-93 lead on a three-pointer from Middleton. </p>
<p> It was a back-and-forth battle from there, with an Antetokounmpo free throw putting Milwaukee up by two with 13.2 seconds remaining. </p>
<p> Out of a timeout Harden missed a three-pointer and Embiid grabbed the rebound for a put-back attempt that Antetokounmpo blocked with 1.6 seconds left. </p>
<p> An initial goaltending call on Antetokounmpo -- which would have given a basket to Philadelphia -- was overturned on review, and on the ensuing jump ball the 76ers ran out of time. </p>
<p> "I just tried to jump as high as I can and make a play," said Antetokounmpo, who also had 14 rebounds and six assists. </p>
<p> - Durant fuels Nets - </p>
<p> Chicago's DeMar DeRozan scored 32 points to lead the Bulls to a 107-94 victory over the Washington Wizards and into sole possession of fifth place in the East. </p>
<p> Brooklyn superstar Kevin Durant scored 41 points and grabbed 11 rebounds as the Nets erased a 12-point second-quarter deficit to beat the Detroit Pistons 130-123 at Barclays Center. </p>
<p> Kyrie Irving scored 24 points and Andre Drummond added 14 for Brooklyn, who had six players score in double figures. </p>
<p> The victory kept the Nets a game ahead of the Charlotte Hornets for eighth place in the East. </p>
<p> In Los Angeles, Paul George returned from a three-month injury absence to score a game-high 34 points and help the Clippers rally from a 25-point third-quarter deficit for a 121-115 victory over the Utah Jazz. </p>
<p> George, sidelined since December 22 with a torn ligament in his right elbow, made six three-pointers, handed out six assists and came up with four steals. </p>
<p> Reggie Jackson added 21 points for the Clippers, who took the lead for the first time, 110-109, with 3:24 left to play. </p>
<p> Donovan Mitchell scored 33 points for the Jazz, who saw guard Trent Forrest depart early with concussion-like symptoms after taking an inadvertent shot to the head from teammate Rudy Gobert. </p>

<p> What Dennis Hogan said to Tim Tszyu after copping five-round beatdown from star </p>
<p> That was Dennis Hogan's humbling admission to Tim Tszyu after the Irishman copped a five-round TKO beatdown from the Aussie superstar in Newcastle. </p>
<p> While he fired plenty of verbal shots pre-fight, Hogan paid tribute to Tszyu as the pair embraced in the ring on Wednesday night, with the Australian 26-year-old having sent a message to the boxing world. </p>
<p> "It was very respectful," Tszyu said post-fight. "He just said: 'The hype is real'." </p>
<p> Tszyu's manager Glen Jennings added: "He said that to me, too, and it's a wonderful little statement. </p>
<p> "I won't use the language but Dennis said, 'Yeah, the hype is real'. He was very respectful." </p>
<p> Hogan inflicted a cut to Tszyu's left eye but otherwise, it was a one-sided fight in which the Aussie brutalised the Irishman, going especially hard on his body. Hogan's corner threw in the towel to save him needless damage. </p>
<p> Tszyu, the WBO's No.1 super-welterweight contender, joined a decorated list of fighters to have toppled Hogan. The Irishman's last defeat came against American star Jermall Charlo, fighting for the WBC world middleweight title. </p>
<p> Prior to that, he lost to Mexican fighter Jaime Munguia, in a bout for the WBO super-welterweight title. In 2016, he lost to German Jack Culcay while fighting for the WBA interim super-welterweight world title. He dropped to 28-4-1 (seven KOs) with his loss to Tszyu. </p>
<p> "I'm not satisfied," Tszyu said. "I want to be a global boxing star. </p>
<p> "That's my goal. It's always been my goal and I need those big guys. We're at that stage where I do believe I can compete with the big boys. </p>
<p> "Charlo got rid of Hogan in seven [rounds]. I do it in five. So my pace was a bit more quicker than Charlo's. I want an international fight. I want to be recognised globally." </p>
<p> Tszyu (18-0, 14 KOs) is hoping to fight WBO super-welterweight world champion Brian Castano, though the Argentinian is chasing a unification bout against Jermell Charlo; Jermall Charlo's identical twin brother, who is the current IBF, WBA, WBC and The Ring super-welterweight champion. </p>

<p> 2022 Fantasy Football: Pete Carroll says Rashaad Penny will get 'first shots' as Seattle's starting RB </p>
<p> Is the timing finally right for Rashaad Penny in Seattle? </p>
<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- When a reporter at the NFL Annual Meeting asked Pete Carroll about backup running back Travis Homer, the Seahawks coach took it as an opportunity to talk about Rashaad Penny. </p>
<p> And talk. And talk. </p>
<p> Claiming he's as excited about his run game as any other part of his team, Carroll effectively named Penny the team's starter going into training camp. </p>
<p> "He's going to get the first shots," Carroll proclaimed. "He deserves it, he's earned it." </p>
<p> Carroll backed up his reasoning with what we all saw late last season: an explosive streak of rare athletic talent. Penny totaled 692 yards and scored six times on 97 touches (92 carries, five receptions) over his final five games. Fantasy managers who had him in their lineups enjoyed a 21.4 PPR per-game average -- just in time for the Fantasy postseason. </p>
<p> "If we can get him and Chris (Carson) back and battling, that one-two punch is all I could hope for," Carroll added. "It's what we've envisioned; we just haven't been able to see it as much. And he's been frustrated about it, but that frustration has put a chip on his shoulder that is exactly the type of chip that you like." </p>
<p> Going off of Penny's medical history, it's easier said than done to count on Penny for the long haul. </p>
<p> The 26-year-old has missed 28 games over four seasons, including seven in 2021 with calf and hamstring issues. He tore his ACL in 2019, missed nearly all of 2020 because of it and needed clean-up surgery on it as recently as last June. He's also broken a finger and strained a hammy in practice. </p>
<p> Obviously, Carroll's aware. </p>
<p> "It's no different than with other running backs we've had over the years," he said. "They're not always the same guy in every game, for whatever reason. That's what we've learned, so we go with whoever's hot. But hopefully we'll do that really well and we'll take care of him and bring him through the process to make sure that by the time we start playing games he's ready to go." </p>

<p> Carroll has to follow the same sort of thinking with Carson, who's working his way back from neck surgery. Saying his veteran back is feeling "pretty good," Carroll said he thinks Carson is "going to be able to pull it off" regarding a return, but won't know for sure until he starts practicing. </p>
<p> It creates quite an opportunity for Penny, but the challenges go beyond him staying healthy. The Seahawks play NFC West teams for six games and AFC West teams for four more. Tack on the glaring need for the Seahawks to solve their passing game after trading Russell Wilson, and anyone who runs for Seattle figures to see tough sledding. </p>
<p> It leaves Penny as one of Fantasy's biggest risk-reward considerations. If he overcomes the tough schedule and stays healthy, he can be a league-winner. If he falls into a pitfall that has stopped him before, he'll be a runaway bust. It's enough to keep him outside of the top-50 selections on Draft Day ... until late August. If Penny stays fine through training camp and the preseason, Fantasy managers might be more willing to scoop him up before Round 4 ends. For now, Round 5 is worth the risk. </p>

<p> MOANA PASIFIKA vs HURRICANES, Friday 5.05pm AEDT in Auckland </p>
<p> Moana Pasifika coach Aaron Mauger has handed former Reds centre Henry Taefu his first start against the Hurricanes. </p>
<p> "Henry has a strong physical presence and leadership qualities that will be really valuable on the field against the Hurricanes," Mauger said. </p>
<p> "He has been training really well and put his hand up for selection this weekend. Henry epitomises 'tautua,' which means to serve, and has been a real team man from the beginning of our campaign." </p>
<p> Meanwhile, TJ Perenara will play his first Super Rugby game in 596 days after being named to start at halfback for the Hurricanes. </p>
<p> The All Blacks veteran spent last year playing in Japan and was injured in preseason. </p>
<p> Hurricanes coach Jason Holland has also named three uncapped players in his starting backline: five-eighth Aidan Morgan, centre Teihorangi Walden and winger Josh Moorby. </p>
<p> "Aidan has been in our environment for a couple of years now and has all the skills and a great head on his shoulders," Holland said. </p>
<p> "Teihorangi has been a very popular member of our squad since day one of pre-season and I can't wait to see him in action. Moorby has also earned the respect of the squad really quickly and is an exciting prospect anywhere in the back three." </p>
<p> MOANA PASIFIKA (15-1): William Havili, Tima Fainga'anuku, Levi Aumua, Henry Taefu, Neria Fomua, Christian Leali'ifano, Jonathan Taumateine, Henry Time-Stowers, Solomone Funaki, Sione Tu'ipulotu, Samuel Slade, Veikoso Poloniati, Sekope Kepu (c), Samiuela Moli, Ezekiel Lindenmuth </p>

<p> Rebels coach Kevin Foote has revamped his starting lineup as he continues to search for his first win of the 2022 season. </p>
<p> Centre Stacey Ili, halfback James Tuttle, flanker Brad Wilkin, lock Josh Hill and prop Matt Gibbon are the new faces from the lineup that lost to the Waratahs last weekend. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, Drua coach Mick Byrne has handed hooker Zuriel Togiatama his first start. </p>
<p> "We're getting more belief in what we're doing and realising that when we play well, we're in this competition," Byrne said. </p>
<p> "Words like belief are living words – you get it by living it – and our belief is getting stronger every week so we're delivering better." </p>
<p> REBELS (15-1): Reece Hodge, Andrew Kellaway, Stacey Ili, Raymond Nu'u, Glen Vaihu, Matt To'omua, James Tuttle, Michael Wells (c), Richard Hardwick, Brad Wilkin, Josh Hill, Matt Philip, Cabous Eloff, Jordan Uelese, Matt Gibbon </p>

<p> FORCE vs BRUMBIES, Friday 10pm AEDT in Perth </p>
<p> Force coach Tim Sampson has freshened up his starting lineup in a bid to hand the ladder-leading Brumbies their first loss of the season. </p>
<p> Winger Toni Pulu, centre Kyle Godwin, flaker Kane Koteka, and prop Santiago Medrano are the inclusions from the side that snuck past the Drua last weekend. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, halfback Ryan Lonergan will captain a Brumbies side missing regular skipper Allan Alaalatoa and five-eighth Noah Lolesio. </p>
<p> Lonergan will partner Rod Iona in the halves while Sefo Kautai will start at tighthead prop in place of Alaalatoa. </p>
<p> "We've had a squad mentality all season and we're rotating in a few guys this week who have earned an opportunity and getting valuable recovery into a few players, particularly Allan and Slips (James Slipper) who have put big shifts in these first five rounds," Brumbies coach Dan McKellar said. </p>
<p> "Seeing Ryan Lonergan lead the team out will be a proud day for everyone at the club and in ACT rugby who have watched him come through as a kid but it's a responsibility he is more than ready for and not much will change for him." </p>
<p> Reserves: Andrew Ready, Bo Abra, Greg Holmes, Tim Anstee, Ollie Callan, Issak Fines- Leleiwasa, Reesjan Pasitoa, Richard Kahui </p>

<p> HIGHLANDERS vs BLUES, Saturday 2.35pm AEDT in Dunedin </p>
<p> Netherlands-born lock Fabian Holland is in line to make his Highlanders debut after being named on the bench against the Blues. </p>
<p> The 19-year-old is 2.04m and coach Tony Brown is tipping a bright future. </p>
<p> "It's a great opportunity for Fabian, he's been outstanding in our training environment this year and while he's young, he's a really exciting player, and I'm sure he will feed off the energy from the team and crowd at Forsyth Barr Stadium on Saturday," Brown said. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, Beauden Barrett is back from his COVID-19 absence to boost the Blues. </p>
<p> HIGHLANDERS (15-1): Sam Gilbert, Ngatungane Punivai, Fetuli Paea, Scott Gregory, Mosese Dawai, Mitch Hunt, Aaron Smith (c), Marino Mikaele-Tu'u, James Lentjes, Shannon Frizell, Josh Dickson, Manaaki Selby-Rickit, Jermaine Ainsley, Liam Coltman, Daniel Lienert-Brown </p>

<p> Co-captain Sam Cane is back in the Chiefs lineup after missing the big win over Moana Pasifika last weekend. </p>

<p> Reds co-captain Tate McDermott will make his return from an ankle injury in what is the only change to the 23 after last weekend's narrow loss to the Brumbies. </p>
<p> "He's back quicker than expected which is great for our program, and a huge credit to both Tate and our medical team," Reds coach Brad Thorn said. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, Tane Edmed will make his first Super Rugby start for a Waratahs side reeling from a lengthy injury and COVID-19 list of absentees. </p>
<p> Edmed will wear the NSW No.10 jersey for the first time and will have Welsh great Jamie Roberts outside him after centre Izaia Perese was ruled out under COVID-19 protocols. </p>
<p> Edmed replaces new Wallabies squad member Ben Donaldson (calf) with Michael Hooper, Jake Gordon, Lachie Swinton, James Turner, Jeremy Williams and James Ramm among the other unavailable players. </p>

<p> Roger Federer is a name that's been notably absent from tennis tournaments for the past nine months. </p>
<p> Roger Federer has announced that he will be donating $500,000 (£379,472.50) to help children affected by the war in Ukraine. </p>

<p> Stakhovsky, who famously beat Roger Federer at Wimbledon in 2013, last week said he had signed up for Ukraine’s military reserves. </p>
<p> Roger Federer says any tournament comeback from his knee surgery last year will not be until at least the late summer. </p>
<p> The rise of On Running has been a boon to Swiss tennis great Roger Federer, but it has also lifted two families behind private equity firm 3G Capital. 3G co-founder Carlos Alberto Sicupira and Marc Lemann, the son of 3G co-founder Jorge Paulo Lemann, collectively own a $1 billion stake in On, around 14% of the company. </p>
<p> Tennis star Roger Federer won't know until this spring if he will be able to return to the court following knee surgery. </p>
<p> Roger Federer says he and Rafael Nadal were joking about both being on crutches just a few months ago as he congratulated him on his Australian Open win. </p>
<p> It was learned over the summer that tennis living legend Roger Federer required a third surgery on his knee, would miss the U.S. Open and would ultimately </p>
<p> Roger Federer is set to miss January's Australian Open but is not planning to retire from tennis at the moment, says his coach. </p>
<p> Playing the Australian Open in January is ‘not a real possibility’ for Roger Federer, his coach has confirmed. Federer has had three operations on his knee since the 2020 Australian Open, and his attempted comeback earlier this year broke down after a disappointing Wimbledon. </p>
<p> Roger Federer is ‘still hungry’ and fully intending to make a full return to the ATP, says Tommy Haas. Federer has had a frustrating time with injury since the 2020 Australian Open, and he underwent his third knee surgery this summer after a failed comeback attempt ended at Wimbledon. </p>
<p> Italian Davis Cup legend Paolo Bertolucci believes that although Roger Federer is the most iconic player of all time, Novak Djokovic is the best. Djokovic and Federer along with Rafael Nadal have been locked in a three-way rivalry for tennis history for more than a decade, and all have strong cases to be considered the greatest of all time. </p>
<p> Roger Federer says he believes an ‘incredible player’ will come along and surpass the achievements of the big three. Federer, along with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have all amassed 20 Grand Slam titles in their remarkable careers, and all will be eying more before they are eventually done too. </p>
<p> Roger Federer says he is ‘in a really good place’ with his latest injury and he expects to be back on-court next season. Federer has endured a horrendous 18 months with him requiring three operations to correct a knee problem. </p>
<p> Roger Federer says he is "in a really good place" with his recovery from last month's knee surgery but clarified that he would not rush into returning to court. </p>
<p> On, the shoe brand backed by Roger Federer, lifted its expected value by 33% on Tuesday by raising its share price and shares issued while going public The company issued 31.1 million shares at $24 each, well above a previously reported plan to sell 25.4 million shares at $18-20. </p>
<p> Djokovic is also looking to break a tie with Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer for the most majors in men’s tennis (they all have 20). </p>
<p> Roger Federer won’t be collecting a check in today’s U.S. Open men’s final, but that’s okay./ He will be securing the bag in a big way in the coming weeks. </p>
<p> Former world number two Alex Corretja believes Roger Federer will not retire yet despite his latest injury blow. Federer spent 14 months out following two operations on his knee before returning to action earlier this year. </p>
<p> Roger Federer has revealed that he will be out for several months after undergoing surgery on his right knee. Federer, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all-time, took to Instagram to reveal that he suffered damage to his knee over the grass court season. </p>
<p> Federer can certainly make a comeback. At his age, however, it’s going to be a very big ask for the 20-time Grand Slam champion. </p>
<p> Federer announced that he will miss the U.S. Open and be sidelined for "many months" because he needs a third operation on his right knee. </p>
<p> Missing that tournament could prove to be a brutal blow for Federer, as he, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal are all tied for the men's all-time record with 20 career Grand Slam trophies heading into the year's final major. </p>
<p> Hubert Hurkacz described beating Roger Federer at Wimbledon as ‘indescribable,’ although he wished he could have built on it. Hurkacz beat Federer in the quarter-finals, inflicting a first ever Wimbledon bagel on the Swiss star along the way. </p>
<p> Tennis legend Roger Federer won’t be able to compete for Switzerland in the Tokyo Olympics due to a setback he suffered to his injured knee during the grass court season. </p>
<p> Evert is an 18-time major winner and was a longtime No. 1-ranked player in the world. You would hope that someone talking tennis on TV would know her name, but that wasn’t the case for ESPN on Tuesday. </p>

<p> "From what I heard, we were around 270 km/h when I hit that wall. I think in a road car, that wouldn't look quite well. But I mean, luckily, the cars are so safe these days that I was able to walk away from it and stand here with no issues." </p>

<p> 0 of 5 </p>
<p> Matt Slocum/Associated Press </p>
<p> Although we're in the hibernation period of the NBA offseason, this doesn't mean we can't see a few fireworks before 2021-22 officially kicks off. </p>
<p> There's the whole Ben Simmons situation that needs to resolve itself, the Portland Trail Blazers should constantly be looking for ways to keep Damian Lillard happy and the guard-heavy Sacramento Kings could use some better roster balance. </p>
<p> Rebuilding teams containing win-now veterans with two years or less on their deals need to be wary about their contention timelines, making players like Christian Wood and Thaddeus Young likely to pop up in trade talks soon as well. </p>
<p> Here are five big trades that could all still happen before the start of the season. </p>
<p> Christian Wood Gives Clippers a Center Upgrade </p>
<p> 1 of 5 </p>
<p> Darren Abate/Associated Press </p>
<p> Los Angeles Clippers Receive: C Christian Wood, F Danuel House </p>
<p> Houston Rockets Receive: SG Keon Johnson, C Ivica Zubac, G/F Luke Kennard, 2022 second-round pick, 2023 second-round pick, 2024 second-round pick, 2025 second-round pick </p>
<p> The Clippers should be on the playoff fringe assuming Kawhi Leonard misses most (if not all) of the regular season with a partially torn ACL. Trading for Wood gives Paul George a true running mate while Leonard recovers and a legit Big 3 for the postseason—a destination the Clippers are far more likely to reach with Wood en tow. </p>
<p> Last year's starting center Serge Ibaka picked up his $9.7 million player option to return to L.A., but the 31-year-old big man had back surgery in June. Leaning on Ibaka to play a full, healthy season is unrealistic given what he's returning from. With Wood as the starting 5 and Ibaka as a reserve, it's far more likely the three-time All-Defensive team member will hold up throughout the regular season and playoffs. </p>
<p> Wood averaged 21.0 points, 9.6 rebounds, 1.2 blocks and shot 37.4 percent from three last season, giving George, Reggie Jackson, Eric Bledsoe and the rest of L.A.'s guards some frontcourt spacing. House provides more wing defense with Leonard out. </p>
<p> For a Rockets team that's now built around 19-year-old Jalen Green, even Wood (who turns 26 later this month) doesn't fit the timeline, especially with just two years left until he hits unrestricted free agency. </p>
<p> Trading Wood now guarantees the best possible return, one that includes a nice package of young(ish) players in Johnson (19), Zubac (24) and Kennard (25, with four years remaining on his deal) and draft picks in each of the next four years. </p>
<p> Zubac keeps Houston's starting center job warm until Alperen Sengun is ready to take over, Johnson is another high-upside wing for the team to build around and Kennard (44.6 percent from three last season) gives everyone the spacing they need. </p>
<p> Kristaps Porzingis Balances out Kings' Roster, Mavs Get Luka Another Shooter </p>
<p> Dallas Mavericks Receive: SG Buddy Hield, PF Marvin Bagley III, 2022 second-round pick (via Atlanta Hawks) </p>
<p> The Porzingis experiment should be scrapped in Dallas immediately, as the 26-year-old just hasn't played up to his billing as a No. 2 option next to Luka Doncic. Moving him to Sacramento (and its collection of high-upside guards) gives both sides a fresh start. </p>
<p> For Sacramento, Porzingis is still the only All-Star in this group, even if his contract (three years, $101.5 million) and injury history may give them pause. Still, he averaged 20.1 points, 8.9 rebounds, 1.3 blocks and shot 37.6 percent from three for Dallas last season and has been a productive offensive player when healthy. </p>
<p> The Kings would also be getting off Hield's contract (three years, $61.5 million), and moving the veteran shooting guard opens up more playing time for Tyrese Haliburton and rookie Davion Mitchell. A lineup of De'Aaron Fox, Haliburton, Harrison Barnes, Porzingis and Richaun Holmes with Mitchell and Finney-Smith off the bench is far better that what the Kings have now and affords them better overall roster balance. </p>
<p> Finney-Smith is an ideal 3-and-D forward who's on an insanely-good contract ($4 million), and moving Bagley (who likely wouldn't have re-signed next summer anyways) shouldn't hurt. </p>
<p> For Dallas, this is about getting off Porzingis' deal while adding some useful players who complement Luka Doncic. </p>
<p> Hield is a big shooting guard who's averaged 18.9 points and shot 40.3 percent from three over the past three years. Loading up on shooters next to Doncic (Hield, Tim Hardaway Jr., Reggie Bullock) while putting a single big on the floor (Maxi Kleber/Dwight Powell) may be the Mavs' best strategy given his incredible shot-creation ability. </p>
<p> The Mavs also get a look at Bagley while he's still on his rookie deal, and they can match any deal he receives in restricted free agency should the 2018 No. 2 pick have a break-out year in a new environment. </p>
<p> Thaddeus Young Joins Phoenix Suns in 3-Team Deal </p>
<p> 3 of 5 </p>
<p> Adam Hunger/Associated Press </p>
<p> Phoenix Suns Receive: PF Thaddeus Young </p>
<p> San Antonio Spurs Receive: PF Davis Bertans, F/C Jalen Smith </p>
<p> Washington Wizards Receive: PG Tre Jones, F/C Dario Saric </p>
<p> While Jae Crowder did a solid job as the Suns' starting power forward in their run to the NBA Finals last season, Young would be an overall upgrade at the position. </p>
<p> The veteran big man showed off the best passing of his career last year with the Chicago Bulls, is a solid team defender and can play small-ball 5. He's also shown the ability to knock down threes when asked, making 37.2 percent of his catch-and-shoot looks in 2019-20. For a team that's ready to win now, both Smith (156 total minutes as a rookie last year) and Saric (possibly out for the year with a torn ACL) aren't going to help. </p>
<p> San Antonio needs frontcourt help with a guard-heavy roster, both now and in the future. Bertans has thrived with the Spurs before (40.4 percent from three in 220 games from 2016-2019) and would help space the floor for guys like Dejounte Murray, Derrick White, Keldon Johnson and others. Smith, the No. 10 pick in the 2020 NBA draft, has shown potential as a three-point shooter and rim protector, one that can take his time developing on a rebuilding Spurs squad. </p>
<p> Washington does this deal for the salary relief, as Bertans is owed $65 million over the next four years, and the Wizards now have Kyle Kuzma to go with Rui Hachimura at power forward. While Saric likely won't play this year, he's under a more reasonable two-year, $18.7 million deal. </p>
<p> Jones, 21, gives Washington some added point guard depth behind Spencer Dinwiddie. </p>
<p> Sixers Swap Tobias Harris for CJ McCollum... </p>
<p> While the popular Ben Simmons-for-McCollum trade has been floated around, the Sixers should be eyeing another player on their roster to flip in a deal for the veteran shooting guard. </p>
<p> Harris and McCollum are extremely similar in many ways. Both are 29, have been borderline All-Stars for years now and are big-time scorers and good distributors on $30-plus million annual contracts. </p>
<p> The key difference? Positioning. </p>
<p> By swapping McCollum for Harris, Portland gets to move Norman Powell back to shooting guard on a full-time basis, giving them a bigger frontcourt with Harris and Robert Covington. The Blazers don't lose any scoring, with Harris giving them a floor-spacing power forward who can create off the short roll and make life easier for Damian Lillard. </p>
<p> McCollum would shine as the lead ball-handler in Philly after putting up 23.1 points, 3.9 rebounds, 4.7 assists and shooting 40.2 percent from three as a second backcourt option in Portland. He's never played with a frontcourt talent like Joel Embiid before, and there's plenty of shooters (Seth Curry, Danny Green) to kick out to as well. </p>
<p> Moving Harris for McCollum gives the Sixers more Simmons trade possibilities as well. </p>
<p> While the Sixers were likely focused on getting an All-Star guard back in return, they can now focus on trade partners offering frontcourt talent instead. </p>
<p> ...then Send Ben Simmons to the Atlanta Hawks </p>
<p> Assuming the Sixers pull off the CJ McCollum-Tobias Harris swap, they still need to figure out a new home for Simmons. </p>
<p> The three-time All-Star has already helped the Hawks advance in the postseason, so joining Atlanta on a full-time basis only makes sense. </p>
<p> Simmons and Trae Young would be one of the NBA's best backcourts and could cover for each other's weaknesses extremely well. Young has no problem taking shots from anywhere inside the halfcourt line, and his defensive shortcomings would be negated by Simmons' incredible abilities on that end. </p>
<p> There's also enough shooters left on Atlanta's roster to make the fit work (Young, Bogdan Bogdanovic, John Collins, DeAndre Hunter, Lou Williams, Delon Wright), and Simmons can play anywhere up or down the lineup as an all-world shot-creator and defender. </p>
<p> For Philly, they get a replacement for Harris at power forward in Gallinari, who's still one of the best floor-spacing big men in the NBA. Huerter is a 6'7" shooting guard who can handle the ball and Reddish still carries incredible upside on both ends. </p>
<p> The Sixers would carry a starting five of McCollum, Seth Curry, Danny Green, Gallinari and Embiid to begin the season, with a bench of Huerter, Reddish, Tyrese Maxey, Matisse Thybulle and Andre Drummond. </p>
<p> Not only is Philly set up to win right away, there's still enough young talent on the roster to make a run at Damian Lillard or any other star who may pop up on the trade market during the year. </p>

<p> Tiger Woods inducted into World Golf Hall of Fame </p>
<p> The greatest of his generation, Tiger Woods, took his place among the best of all time on Thursday when he was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame and shared a life story of a passion to play and a work ethic that made him feel like he earned it. </p>
<p> Woods didn't touch on any of his 82 victories on the PGA Tour or his 15 majors, or the eight surgeries he endured along the way. </p>
<p> He spoke of his parents taking out a second mortgage that allowed him to play the junior circuit in California, choking up when he mentioned his late father who told him he would have to earn everything he wanted. </p>
<p> “If you don't go out there and put in the work, you don't go out and put in the effort, one, you're not going to get the results,” Woods said. “But two, and more importantly, you don't deserve it. You need to earn it. So that defined my upbringing. That defined my career.” </p>
<p> He was introduced by Sam, his 14-year-old daughter who said her father preaches to her and 13-year-old brother Charlie the same message he learned from his late father. </p>
<p> “Train hard, fight easy.” </p>
<p> Woods was the headliner in an induction class that included retired PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem, three-time US Women's Open champion Susie Maxwell Berning and the late Marion Hollins, a visionary who became the first woman to develop prominent golf courses. </p>
<p> There was little doubt Woods belonged in the Hall of Fame. </p>
<p> He was on a slate of candidates two years ago, all of them introduced one at a time with a list of their accomplishments — except for Woods. There was no need to bring up what he achieved, who he influenced and the enormous impact he had on his sport in attracting new fans, spiking television ratings and increasing prize money. </p>
<p> The Players Championship prize fund this week is $20 million, and that’s not lost on the players in the field. The entire purse was $3.5 million in 1997 when Woods made his debut. The winner this week gets $3.6 million. </p>
<p> “I think every pro out here owes a debt of gratitude to Tiger because this sport wouldn’t be where it is today without his impact,” Patrick Cantlay, who won the $15 million prize last year as FedEx Cup champion, said earlier this week. </p>
<p> Woods, the first player of Black and Asian heritage to win a major at the 1997 Masters when he was 21, also spoke of the discrimination he felt as a youth. He told one story about going to a country club to play a tournament, and he wasn't allowed in the clubhouse like the other juniors because of the colour of his skin. </p>
<p> “So I was denied access into the clubhouses. That's fine. Put my shoes on here in the parking lot,” he said. “I asked two questions only, that was it. Where was the first tee, and what was the course record? Not complicated.” </p>
<p> The room at PGA Tour headquarters, which only held about 500 people, burst into applause. </p>
<p> The ceremony was moved from the World Golf Village, which held previous ceremonies in Florida, to the new PGA Tour headquarters located about a kilometer away from where Woods first rose to fame. </p>
<p> Sure, there was the appearance on the Mike Douglas Show when he was a 2-year-old prodigy and the three straight US Junior Amateur titles. It was on the island green on the par-3 17th hole at the TPC Sawgrass in the 1994 US Amateur when Woods first delivered the uppercut that would define his celebration. </p>
<p> That was the first of an unprecedented three straight US Amateur titles, and it only got better. </p>
<p> Much better. </p>
<p> His record is so strong that Woods had three Hall of Fame careers in one. After four full years as a pro, he already had the career Grand Slam and 24 victories on the PGA Tour. The first major was the 1997 Masters, which he won by 12, one of 20 records. </p>
<p> When he was 30, he already had 46 wins on tour and 10 majors, including a sweep of the majors, a feat no one had ever accomplished. </p>
<p> Woods now has a record-tying 82 wins on the PGA Tour, along with 15 majors, three behind the gold standard set by Jack Nicklaus. </p>
<p> More than his wins was his influence. </p>
<p> Woods never wanted to be looked upon as a golfer but rather an athlete. He wasn’t the first to find the gym, but his devotion to strength and fitness created a template for others to follow. </p>
<p> “Tiger changed people’s perception of golf from a game to a sport,” Padraig Harrington said. </p>
<p> Woods' popularity, his showmanship, was so great that Finchem was able to turn that into television contracts that sent purses soaring. </p>
<p> Finchem also created the World Golf Championships events, and a Presidents Cup to give the burgeoning group of international players from outside Europe a chance to compete in team matches. And he kept the PGA Tour strong with sponsors during the recession of 2008. </p>
<p> Maxwell Berning won only 11 times on the LPGA Tour, but she played in an era when juggling family and golf led to short careers. </p>
<p> She won the US Women’s Open three times — only five others have won at least three — in a six years. She also won the Women's Western Open, a major in her era. She noted she earned a total of $16,000 from her three Women's Open titles. </p>
<p> “I was wondering if you’d like to swap checks,” Berning said to Woods. </p>
<p> Hollins financed and developed a golf course for women in New York and was the brains behind two fabled golf courses in California — Cypress Point and Pasatiempo. Hollins, who died in 1944 at age 51, was a visionary in golf course architecture, a confidante of Alister Mackenzie and a US Women’s Amateur champion. </p>
<p> Renee Powell was honoured with the inaugural Charlie Sifford Award for her spirit in advancing diversity in golf, while the Lifetime Achievement recognition went to Peter Ueberroth and the late Richard Ferris, both part of the ownership group at Pebble Beach. </p>
<p> The induction brought the Hall of Fame to 164 members. </p>

<p> Stars align for Ricciardo and McLaren in multi-million dollar investment: report </p>
<p> There's a lot of excitement ahead of Daniel Ricciardo's impending switch to McLaren for the 2021 season, and it seems the move couldn't be coming at a better time for the Aussie. </p>
<p> As the Aussie F1 star prepares for his final race with Renault ahead of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, McLaren are on the verge of a massive milestone. </p>
<p> Their two current drivers Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz have qualified fourth and sixth at Yas Marina Circuit, meaning that McLaren has a shot at a third place finish in the constructors' championship for the first time since 2012. </p>
<p> The revitalisation comes as the team also prepare to use a Mercedes power unit in their vehicles next season which should go a way to closing the gap on the F1 frontrunners, with the acquisition of Ricciardo perhaps the crowning jewel of the groundswell behind McLaren. </p>
<p> As if that couldn't get any better, Sky News now reports that a consortium of US-based investors are on the verge of buying a big stake in Ricciardo's soon-to-be team. </p>
<p> It is expected that it will inject £185m ($A325m) into McLaren Racing over two years. Sky reports that the deal could be announced as early as Sunday. </p>
<p> The stars seem to be aligning for Ricciardo as he prepares to fit in to blossoming McLaren jigsaw, but ever the professional, the Aussie is only focussed on the job at hand. </p>
<p> "It's a shame finishing twelfth today as we looked quick this morning (in practice) with third and fourth and we were aiming for much higher than that," said Ricciardo after qualification. </p>
<p> "We got through to Q2 quite comfortably with just one fast lap on the softs, but then we struggled to match the pace on both medium and soft tyres. I don't think we know why yet, so we'll take a look at it tonight. </p>
<p> "I don't like starting eleventh, but we both have tyre choice tomorrow so that's a positive from today as strategy is going to be key in the race. </p>
<p> "We saw last weekend how starting on the medium tyres can pay off, so we have options tomorrow. It's my last race with the team too and I want to make sure we end this on a high." </p>

<p> EXCLUSIVE: Barry Hall dismisses Sonny Bill Williams' star-studded training camp as a sign of 'weakness' </p>
<p> Barry Hall believes Sonny Bill Williams' star-studded overseas training camp shows "weakness" in the latest verbal blow before Wednesday's clash of the codes grudge match in Sydney. </p>
<p> Dual code champion Williams tuned up for his ninth professional fight with a six week trip to the United Kingdom and Ireland, rubbing shoulders and trading punches with some of the best in the business. </p>
<p> Williams was invited into world champion Tyson Fury's inner sanctum where he also trained under gun coach Andy Lee and alongside Kiwi stars Joseph Parker and David Nyika. </p>

<p> The 36-year-old body sparred against Fury and Parker and Lee also took him out of his comfort zone for no-holds barred sparring sessions against the likes of European champion Tommy McCarthy and the well regarded Nick Campbell. </p>
<p> "Him going and training with all those people is fine, that's OK, he can train with whoever he wants," Hall told Wide World of Sports. </p>
<p> "But it's going to be me and him in there. That's what I've focused on, I've got a solid team that I've put the trust in to tick off all the boxes for this camp. </p>
<p> Hall teams up with UFC star </p>
<p> "We've chosen to stay that way, I didn't feel the need to go overseas and change trainers and do these sorts of things. Some people might see it as a strength, I actually see it as a weakness to be perfectly honest. </p>
<p> "I'm with my same team, doing my same thing and I've put trust in them that what they can provide for me is going to be enough to do the job." </p>
<p> "The prep's going really well, no injuries which is great. I'm fit, doing the rounds at a pretty good pace," he said. </p>
<p> Hall said he had done his best to tune out the external chatter leading up to fight week but after speaking with Volkanovski wanted to embrace the pageantry on the night. </p>
<p> "There's been a bit going around but I haven't really taken too much notice of it. It's all about us at the moment and all that white noise is exactly that," Hall said. </p>

<p> 4 players the Detroit Lions may release to create additional cap space </p>
<p> The Detroit Lions are expected to continue overhauling their roster and, as it stands, will begin the offseason with about $21 million in salary-cap space, which is currently the 13th most across the NFL. </p>
<p> Although the Lions have money to spend and a plethora of draft capital in their back pocket, general manager Brad Holmes needs to consider making a few cuts to open up additional salary cap space heading into free agency. </p>
<p> The Detroit Lions have a ton of needs throughout their roster and will be looking for contributors via free agency and the 2022 NFL Draft. Holmes inherited a lackluster roster built by Bob Quinn and the incompetent, arrogant Matt Patricia. </p>
<p> In year one, Holmes also swung and missed a few times, especially at the receiver position. Neither of his top free-agent acquisitions survived the year last season. Breshard Perriman didn’t make the team’s Week One roster, and Tyrell Williams appeared in just one game before suffering a concussion and eventually agreeing upon an injury settlement. </p>
<p> Heading into his second year at the helm, I expect Holmes to leave more of a footprint on this roster, especially in free agency. Once again, the Detroit Lions will be looking for a top outside receiving threat to pair with the sensational second-year swiss army knife, Amon-Ra St. Brown. Although I don’t expect Detroit to land an elite talent like Davante Adams, I foresee Holmes attempting to sign someone like Allen Robinson or D.J. Chark. </p>
<p> The Detroit Lions also have needs at every level of their defense, so Holmes certainly has his work cut out for him this offseason. </p>
<p> Here are four players the Detroit Lions can release to free up nearly $19.5 million ahead of free agency. </p>

<p> Formula 1's 2021 regulations: What's new for 2021? </p>
<p> Thanks to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 Formula 1 regulations will remain largely the same from 2020 - with a few key changes over the off-season </p>
<p> Although an entirely new ruleset had been agreed upon for 2021, the financial problems levelled on F1 by the pandemic forced a delay to the sweeping technical changes, meaning 2021 will carry over much in the way of progress between seasons. </p>
<p> Here are the key changes to the technical regulations for the 2021 F1 season, and what we can expect to see. </p>
<p> Why were the original 2021 regulations delayed? </p>
<p> F1 had settled upon a new aerodynamic formula, complete with a reduced reliance on overbody aerodynamics - such as wings and bargeboards - and replaced them with a ground effect formula, not seen since 1982. </p>
<p> However, the severely reduced income for teams over 2020 meant that those changes had to be moved back to 2022. </p>
<p> Teams rely on income from attending races, from sponsorships and partnerships with other companies, and from prize money. With no racing at all throughout the first half of 2020, teams were operating at a considerable loss. </p>
<p> To ease those financial concerns and any hangover into the new year, the decision was made to carry over the majority of the key structural components into 2021, rather than demand that teams had to design an entirely new car within a difficult financial period. </p>
<p> Which parts are carried over into 2021? </p>
<p> Predominantly, the chassis (denoted as the survival cell and roll structures), suspension components and crash structures should be carried over into 2021, essentially making this year's F1 grid a collection of B-spec cars. </p>
<p> Teams are allowed to make limited changes to those components, through the use of a token system. </p>
<p> Each team has two tokens that they are able to use to make changes, and the FIA technical regulations detail which parts require tokens to change and how many teams must exchange to develop that area. </p>
<p> For example, the survival cell is split into two parts, with each half requiring two tokens to develop. Teams may decide that either the front or the rear section of it needs further development. </p>
<p> There are situations where the tokens need not apply, and changes can be made to the front crash structure if those modifications only affect the nose fairings. </p>
<p> If teams spend both tokens in a certain area, then all other parts of the car that require tokens to develop must be carried forward into 2021. </p>
<p> Teams using customer 2019 parts, such as Racing Point or AlphaTauri, will be allowed to upgrade to a 2020 specification without expending any tokens. </p>
<p> Which areas are free to develop? </p>
<p> The aerodynamics and power unit are the key areas that may be developed - although the power unit must be frozen in its current specification once it has been homologated. </p>
<p> This means that the usual aerodynamic changes throughout the season will remain in place, if the team's budget allows it to develop those areas. </p>
<p> There are also some required aerodynamic changes for 2021 to reduce the overall downforce output, which was to assist Pirelli as the Italian tyre manufacturer had to run essentially the same tyre specification for a third consecutive year. </p>
<p> Although Pirelli has made some structural changes to the tyres for this year to avoid a similar raft of blow-outs that they sustained during last year's British GP, reducing the aero loads of each car means that Pirelli can opt to run lower pressures. </p>
<p> Otherwise, the only counter towards the increased off-season development was to increase pressures further, bringing the Pirelli tyres into a range that they were not designed for. </p>
<p> What are the new aerodynamic rules for 2021? </p>
<p> The rear corner of the floor, between the back of the survival cell and the rear axle, will be cut off to limit the overall downforce. </p>
<p> This also purges the floor of the multitude of slots and cuts that are used to allow airflow to drift outwards and create a seal to protect the diffuser. </p>
<p> Losing those pumps more turbulent air into the diffuser, which also loses 50mm from the internal fences that break up the diffuser and control the airflow. </p>
<p> As a result, the diffuser will be less effective and produce less downforce, reducing the overall load on the tyres. </p>
<p> The changes to the aero package are expected to yield a reduction in downforce of 10%, although it is expected that the brainpower of F1's collective engineering personnel will be able to reclaim this in other areas. </p>
<p> Which teams are expected to make changes? </p>
<p> McLaren will also have to rework the rear end of its MCL35, as it switches to a Mercedes power unit for 2021. </p>
<p> It has also considered a switch to a lower-rake car, which will bring the diffuser closer to the ground and theoretically overcome some of the deficit produced by the reduction in size of diffuser elements. </p>
<p> "The floor change, although it looks quite a small and insignificant change, how it actually changes the aerodynamics at the back of the car is quite dramatic really," said Fry. </p>
<p> Numerous teams have explored the impact of the 2021 floors in practice; Renault, Red Bull, Haas, McLaren and Ferrari have all trialled the reduced-size bodywork during the season. </p>
<p> Ferrari, Renault and Haas have all tried small curls on the trailing edge of the floor to bring airflow inwards, and the former had also investigated the effect of a floor featuring inwashing fins. </p>
<p> OPINION: Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc have engaged in two thrilling wheel-to-wheel scraps from the opening two 2022 Formula 1 races. Those haven’t ended in controversy, which has raised a question over how their rivalry compares to Verstappen’s against Lewis Hamilton in 2021 </p>
<p> With Formula 1's shift to ground effect aerodynamics, it was hoped that the championship could eventually do away with DRS if the new cars could catch and pass each other more effectively. But DRS enhanced the duel between Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc, showing the drag reduction system still has a place in F1 </p>
<p> Lewis Hamilton took a surprise podium in the Bahrain F1 season opener, but his struggles in Jeddah underlined that much work still needs to be done for Mercedes to be contending for wins again. The team will hope that Hamilton's upturn in form after a sluggish start to a season featuring a new rules set, in 2009, can be replicated </p>
<p> F1's second visit to Jeddah's high-speed street track produced a spectacular battle between Red Bull and Ferrari at the sharp end, this time with a different result to the Bahrain season-opener. But on a weekend that was thrown into doubt amid off-track distractions, several drivers in cars without race-winning pedigree produced equally valiant performances </p>
<p> For the second Formula 1 race in a row, Charles Leclerc and Max Verstappen contested a thrilling battle for victory that involved multiple passes through DRS detection zones. But, unlike in Bahrain, it was Verstappen who won out in Jeddah to get Red Bull's title challenge back on track </p>
<p> Max Verstappen blazed a trail through karting and Formula 3, with ferocious support from his father Jos. But for all his obvious talent, which earned the future world champion a 2015 Formula 1 drive after just a single year in car racing, the ride to get him there wasn’t always an easy one </p>
<p> Formula 1 has long coveted a second race in the United States and, after several false dawns, the Miami Grand Prix is finally set to fill that void. MARK GALLAGHER finds out why it’s taken so long – and what the prime movers behind the new race are doing to ensure its success </p>
<p> With the Formula 1 weekend in Saudi Arabia now going ahead as planned, there's the small matter of a race to prepare for. After winning in Bahrain, Ferrari is looking to continue its battle with Red Bull over the victory spoils. But, after both drivers crashed in FP2, the Scuderia has made life difficult for itself in Jeddah </p>

<p> Willie John McBride at 80 - Lions, Attenborough and apartheid </p>
<p> By Mark SidebottomBBC Sport NI </p>
<p> Last updated on 6 June 20206 June 2020.From the section Irish Rugby </p>
<p> The great man emerges into the evening sun, casting a shadow as imposing as the grand tree which occupies centre stage in his Ballyclare garden. </p>
<p> Where once there was an abundant weave of chestnut brown hair, there is now a rich silver thatch, the mane shows no sign of diminishing and neither does his frame. </p>
<p> Eyes darting, tongue wagging and jawline jutting like a rock face promontory. </p>
<p> Even now at 80, Willie John McBride has such presence, he is so strikingly statuesque that he might have been quarried fully formed and perfectly proportioned from the Antrim plateau. </p>
<p> As it was, the man voted world rugby's personality of the twentieth century was quick to remind me he was "made in Moneyglass". </p>
<p> "I suppose the genes were kind to me, but my physique was forged on the farm," says McBride. </p>
<p> "My father died when I was just four or five and my mother was an exceptional woman. I loved those early formative years but they were challenging. </p>
<p> "Each Halloween I reflect on his untimely passing. He never got to see me play but I often wonder what he would have made of it all. </p>
<p> "It really makes me, especially at my age, appreciate the privilege of being a parent and grandparent." </p>
<p> Rugby's Attenborough </p>
<p> Ireland captain and coach, the most-capped British and Irish Lion of all time and veteran of five Test tours across two decades. The footballer has long since gone, however the farmer remains. </p>
<p> McBride keeps chickens and donkeys. His garden is a compact field which folds into a copsed hillside, so lush and verdant it could have its own microclimate. It doesn't, but it does have its own menagerie. </p>
<p> There nestled in the crook of a garden incline, chickens chattering and donkeys braying, the old lion king pulls up a seat, preparing to ruck and maul in a kit bag of memories. </p>
<p> The mind remains as agile as a darting Gareth Edwards, the senses as furtive as those of a forest deer, the treacle thick voice as sonorous as Stentor. From his summer seat it booms across time and continents echoing all the way to the far off Transvaal. </p>
<p> "For all the memories that rugby has given me, perhaps the most enduring was off the field," McBride says as his eyes widen and well. </p>
<p> "I'll never forget standing on the banks of the Mara river in Tanzania and marvelling at the migrating wildebeest, hooves thundering down banks and crocodiles snapping at them in a frenzy." </p>
<p> "That could be a metaphor for your sporting life," I quip, which draws a chuckle. </p>
<p> "I do love wildlife. It would have been easier on the body had I followed in David Attenborough's footsteps," he responds. </p>
<p> There was a time when he was as busy globetrotting as Attenborough. </p>
<p> In 1974, amid a welter of controversy, Willie John led the Lions on a tour of South Africa. </p>
<p> Back then, apartheid South Africa was under a blanket boycott by many of international sports' governing bodies, including Fifa and the International Olympic Committee. </p>
<p> However rugby rolled on and the McBride-led 'invincibles' went the full tour unbeaten. </p>
<p> They had travelled in defiance of the then British prime minister Harold Wilson. To some it was a high watermark, to others an indelible stain on an illustrious career. </p>
<p> I ask: "Now at 80, do you have any regrets about flouting the boycott and touring South Africa?" </p>
<p> I sense the question has momentarily wrong footed him, and after a brief pause he responds with: "No, I'd change nothing." </p>
<p> "The squad was under pressure from the media and some protestors before we left London," he added. </p>
<p> "We had a meeting and I said we were rugby players not politicians, but if anyone wanted to leave then they could go home. </p>
<p> "No one left. It was my belief then, and still is now, that sport should be kept separate from politics." </p>
<p> I owe everything to Penny </p>
<p> The shadow of apartheid eclipsed another personal footnote. That same year, he had captained Ireland to victory in the Five Nations. </p>
<p> The following was his last in a green shirt, and fittingly his first and only try for Ireland came in his final game at Lansdowne Road against France. </p>
<p> Would his career have been incomplete had he not scored an international try? </p>
<p> "Ah, not really but I enjoyed the moment," McBride responds. </p>
<p> "Some young fella jumped the hoarding and wrapped me in a tricolour, and forty years on I met him in an airport. </p>
<p> "'Thanks for the memories', he said, having explained who he was," recalls McBride. </p>
<p> "I smiled back and said: "That's what it's all about...but you'll still be hearing from my lawyer." </p>
<p> In a glittering career, is there one rugby memory which prevails above all others? </p>
<p> "Beating the All Blacks in their own back yard in 1971 would have to be up there. We are the only Lions team in the history of rugby to go to New Zealand and win the test series outright. </p>
<p> "We had so many talented rugby footballers, Mike Gibson was a genius and Gareth Edwards was, for me, the most naturally-gifted footballer I've ever played with or against." </p>
<p> The sun is setting and Willie John is lost in the mists of time - back in Eden Park, rampaging through a phalanx of All Blacks, only this time, over his shoulder, appears his wife, Penny, to whisper: "It's getting a little cold out here". </p>
<p> "We've been married 53 years," the great man continues. </p>
<p> "Some of those tours were five months long and I owe everything to my wife. </p>
<p> "Rugby even gave me Penny. I met her on a blind date, her dad was the Ireland team doctor." </p>
<p> If never taking a backwards step was the key to rugby success, what, I wonder, has been the secret of over half a century of marriage? </p>
<p> "Oh, that's simple," he shrugs. </p>
<p> "I always remind her it's a long walk from Ballyclare back to Malahide." </p>
<p> The tongue in cheek observation is book-ended with a worldly wink. </p>
<p> 'I want to live forever' </p>
<p> It's easy to forget that Willie John is now an octogenarian, but as it was on the field, so it is off it - he remains master of all he surveys, composed and in control. </p>
<p> As he ambles to the door he pauses before entering and offloads one last pearl. </p>
<p> "Eighty, I don't feel it. I said to my doctor the other day, 'we have a problem'." </p>
<p> "What's the problem?", the doctor responds. </p>
<p> "I want to live forever, I said." </p>
<p> "And what's the problem with that, Willie?" </p>
<p> "Well, the problem is doctor, you're the key to ensuring that...." </p>
<p> Also in NI Sport </p>
<p> Steven Davis says he wants to see a bright future for Northern Ireland as manager Ian Baraclough continues to integrate young talent. </p>
<p> Head coach Dan McFarland says Ulster must put Saturday's controversial defeat by the Stormers behind them ahead of the climax of the United Rugby Championship season. </p>
<p> Ireland women will become the first senior Irish senior international side to tour Pakistan when they play a six-match white-ball series in November 2022. </p>

<p> Concussion in sport: More former rugby union players prepare to take action </p>
<p> Last updated on 17 December 202017 December 2020.From the section Rugby Union </p>
<p> More former rugby players have joined the legal process against the game's authorities for alleged negligence. </p>
<p> Former Wales Under-20 centre Adam Hughes, 30, is the youngest to claim he has suffered permanent brain damage. </p>
<p> Ex-England Under-21 back row Neil Spence is also one of those involved while four former England and Wales players remain anonymous. </p>
<p> Legal action is being prepared against the Rugby Football Union (RFU), Wales Rugby Union (WRU) and World Rugby. </p>
<p> It means there are now nine players included in preparing the action - although the law firm representing the group says more than 100 players have come forward. </p>
<p> Those additional players will now be tested for early onset dementia and their details added to the potential claim involving the existing nine when it is ready. </p>
<p> A letter of claim, setting out their intention to sue, was delivered to the governing bodies on Thursday. </p>
<p> In response, the RFU, WRU and World Rugby have issued a joint statement to confirm they have received the letter, and are "deeply saddened" to hear personal accounts from the players. </p>
<p> They also say player welfare is taken "extremely seriously" and it "continues to be our number one priority". </p>
<p> World Rugby chairman and former England captain Sir Bill Beaumont said in an open letter his "thoughts are with" those who are struggling and that the organisation will "continue to welcome" the views of former players. </p>
<p> He added the area of concussion is "extremely complex" but that as "the science continues to evolve" rugby will "evolve with it". </p>
<p> Every member of the group of nine, including England's World Cup-winning hooker Steve Thompson, has recently been diagnosed with early signs of dementia. </p>
<p> The former players say repeated blows to the head are to blame. </p>
<p> Spence says he used to be "the fun guy at the party" but that his condition has "taken my personality". </p>
<p> "If I knew I was going to feel like this I wouldn't have signed up," Spence told BBC Sport. </p>
<p> "We knew we were signing up to broken arms, broken legs and knee replacements, but not being neurologically impaired and a degenerative disease. </p>
<p> "I still love the game, and what we are trying to get from this is ideally some change. The change should be potentially limiting some contact during the training." </p>
<p> Meanwhile, 42-year-old Thompson played in every England match when they won the 2003 World Cup, but says: "I can't remember any of those games. It's frightening." </p>
<p> It is the first legal move of its kind in world rugby and, if successful, could change the way the game is played. </p>
<p> Rylands Law, which is representing the group, says the risks of concussion injuries were "known and foreseeable", and list 24 alleged failures on the part of World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU. </p>
<p> "We know senior figures in the game have been discussing the issue of head injuries since the 1970s, and yet here we are, more than 40 years later, with so many players, and at such an early stage in their lives, finding themselves in this awful position," said Richard Boardman of Rylands Law. </p>
<p> "I sincerely hope World Rugby, RFU and WRU will now face up to their responsibilities." </p>
<p> 'The human body is the same the world over' </p>
<p> Meanwhile NFL medical experts say they are in regular communication with rugby authorities about how to reduce concussion in the sport. </p>
<p> NFL chief medical officer Dr Allen Sills says his sport is trying to "share knowledge in a more rapid fashion" with World Rugby and other contact sports. </p>
<p> "We do share regularly with each others sporting groups across the world," Sills told the BBC. </p>
<p> "If there are silver linings with the Covid-19 situation, I would say that this has strengthened our communication further." </p>
<p> Sills says there are some differences with technique and training between American football and rugby union, but admits the internal damage can be similar because "the human body is the same the world over". </p>
<p> "We talk at least every couple of weeks with World Rugby, Australian Football, and a number of these other contact sports, and we're sharing the learnings that we have," he added. </p>
<p> "We share what we're finding in our research, we share what our rules changes are and we're learning from each other and I think we all share the same goal." </p>
<p> What is CTE & how can it be diagnosed? </p>
<p> Each player to have come forward so far has been diagnosed by neurologists at King's College London with early onset dementia and probable Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). </p>
<p> CTE is the disease discovered by Dr Bennet Omalu in American football player Mike Webster, and the subject of the film Concussion starring Will Smith. In 2011, a group of former American football players started a class action against the NFL and won a settlement worth about $1bn (£700m). </p>
<p> CTE can develop when the brain is subjected to numerous small blows or rapid movements - sometimes known as sub-concussions - and is associated with symptoms such as memory loss, depression and progressive dementia. </p>

<p> Azerbaijan Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton backs Naomi Osaka's withdrawal from French Open </p>
<p> By Andrew BensonChief F1 writer </p>
<p> Last updated on 3 June 20213 June 2021.From the section Formula 1 </p>
<p> Lewis Hamilton says the backlash tennis star Naomi Osaka has received following her withdrawal from the French Open is "ridiculous". </p>
<p> And Hamilton said most athletes were "not prepared" for success and that the pressures of fame "weigh heavily on you". </p>
<p> "It can be daunting still standing behind a camera," he said. </p>
<p> "It is not the easiest, particularly if you are an introvert and you do struggle to be under those pressures." </p>
<p> Hamilton was talking before this weekend's Azerbaijan Grand Prix at the end of a week in which the sporting headlines have been dominated by Osaka's withdrawal from the French Open. </p>
<p> The Japanese world number two initially refused to do media commitments at the tournament, to "protect her mental health". </p>
<p> She then pulled out of the tournament on Monday, a day after the organisers of the four Grand Slam tournaments threatened to expel her for not talking to the media. </p>
<p> The incident has opened up a debate about the relationship between sports stars and the media, especially in the context of mental health. </p>
<p> Seven-time champion Hamilton said: "She is an incredible athlete and human being and her activism has been just so impactful. But at such a young age, there is so much weight on her shoulders it is inevitable. </p>
<p> "The fact is, when you are young, you are thrown into the limelight and the spotlight, and it weighs heavily on you. Most of us are not prepared. </p>
<p> "When I came into F1, the team had PR. I was never prepared for being thrown in front of a camera. I was never guided as to what to look out for and helped to navigate through that, so I sort of learned through mistakes. </p>
<p> "But when I was young, I was thrown into the pit and wasn't given any guidance or support." </p>
<p> Hamilton said Osaka had been "incredibly brave" to take her stance and called on the tennis authorities to reconsider their response. </p>
<p> "It is now asking those in power and putting them in question and making them have to think about how they react, because the way they reacted was not good - with the fine," he said. </p>
<p> "Someone talking about their personal mental health and then being fined for it - that was not cool. </p>
<p> "They could have definitely handled it better, and I hope they will take a deep dive into it and find a way to navigate it better in the future. As athletes, we are pushing ourselves to the limit, we are on the edge and we are only human beings." </p>
<p> Expectations for the race </p>
<p> Hamilton lost the championship lead to Red Bull's Max Verstappen at the last race in Monaco, when the Dutchman won and the Mercedes driver could manage only seventh place. </p>
<p> Both men played down the significance of Verstappen's four-point lead after just five races of the season. </p>
<p> Although Mercedes struggled for competitiveness in Monaco, Verstappen said he believed their car was still the quickest on most tracks. </p>
<p> "I do believe they are still on normal tracks ahead of us," Verstappen said. "But for us so far this season we have had a great start compared to other seasons and we just need to keep it up, keep improving, keep bringing new bits to the car all the time to try to improve it and then we have a very good shot at it. </p>
<p> "So far, to be leading the championship is very positive. It is great of course to be first, but it is more important where you end up after the [final] race in Abu Dhabi." </p>
<p> Flexi-wing controversy rumbles on </p>
<p> Mercedes are unhappy that a rule intended to restrict the use of flexible rear wings - which Red Bull are one of the teams to use - is not being brought into force until after this weekend's race in Baku. </p>
<p> They believe that the devices, which reduce drag by tilting backwards above a certain speed on the straight, will be a significant advantage on the pit straight in Baku, which is the longest flat-out stretch on the F1 calendar. </p>
<p> Hamilton, who was the first to draw public attention to what he called the "bendy" wing on the Red Bull, said he did not want to be drawn further into the controversy. </p>
<p> "Regardless of what I think, it doesn't make a difference so I am not looking to get headlines with it," he said. </p>
<p> "I heard about it, I spoke about it, but the fact is they passed the tests that are given for this weekend so we proceed in the way things are. </p>
<p> "Of course it is an advantage on the straights. It can give good time, but we will just try to be the best we can with what we have and hopefully in the future will be better in terms of how they measure those sorts of things." </p>
<p> Mercedes say their rear wing is "rigid", although Red Bull have drawn attention to what they say is a flexible front wing on the world champions' car. </p>

<p> US Open 2021: Johanna Konta pulls out before first-round match </p>
<p> British number one Johanna Konta has pulled out of the US Open with a thigh injury, just hours before she was set to play her opening match on Monday. </p>
<p> Konta, 30, was due to face France's Kristina Mladenovic at about 22:00 BST. </p>
<p> It was further bad luck for Konta, who missed Wimbledon because of a close coronavirus contact and the Olympic Games after contracting it herself. </p>
<p> She is set to drop out of the world's top 50 as a result and be replaced by Heather Watson as British number one. </p>
<p> As well as being hampered by injury and illness, Konta also split with coach Dimitri Zavialoff for a second time in what has been a difficult year. </p>
<p> There was a huge positive earlier this month when she beat Ukraine's world number five Elina Svitolina in Montreal, but she then pulled out of her following match against American teenager Coco Gauff. </p>
<p> Konta, who reached the US Open quarter-finals in 2019, returned to action at the Western and Southern Open a fortnight ago, losing to Czech Katerina Muchova in three sets. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, Emma Raducanu's scheduled first-round opponent Jennifer Brady - the 13th seed and Australian Open runner-up - has withdrawn because of a knee injury. </p>
<p> The British teenager will instead play Swiss world number 128 Stefanie Vogele on her overseas Grand Slam debut. </p>
<p> Raducanu, 18, is aiming to back up her Wimbledon exploits - where she reached the last 16 as a wildcard - after coming through qualifying in New York. </p>
<p> After initially being set to play American Brady on Arthur Ashe Stadium, Raducanu now faces Vogele on court 17 at around 19:00 BST on Tuesday. </p>

<p> Rodgers’ extension impacts the status of Jordan Love–the quarterback general manager Brian Gutekunst infamously traded up to take in the 2020 NFL draft’s first round. </p>
<p> Rodgers’ extension takes up the entirety of Love’s rookie contract. It also means Love does not start another game in Green Bay unless Rodgers is hurt or retires before the contract expires. </p>
<p> Talk about a waste of a first-round draft pick. The Green Bay Packers could trade Love, but according to Gutekunst, it is unlikely to happen this offseason. </p>
<p> It has gotten some folks to wonder if Love was one of the worst draft picks of all time. </p>
<p> The logic is the Green Bay Packers could have been better served drafting a wide receiver to help Rodgers. Tee Higgins, Michael Pittman Jr, and Chase Claypool were all available. </p>
<p> Having one of those three guys sure would have helped lessen the blow of the Davante Adams trade. </p>
<p> The Packers could have also gotten some defensive help. </p>
<p> The last thing the Green Bay Packers need was a quarterback, let alone trading up to draft one in the first round. </p>
<p> To say Jordan Love is the worst pick in draft history is a little overboard for a couple of reasons. </p>
<p> One, Ryan Leaf will always reign supreme as probably the worst draft pick ever in NFL history. </p>
<p> Two, it is true that Love did not inspire confidence in his start against the Kansas City Chiefs and extended playing time against the Detroit Lions. That does not mean he will still be a bust. </p>
<p> Jordan Love has had 131 career snaps. Kirk Cousins only played 106 snaps his rookie season in 2012 but didn't regularly start until 2015. For those that keep saying that Love will be a bust have no idea. Being a successful NFL quarterback usually means landing in a good spot. </p>
<p> Third, he is not even the worst draft pick by the Green Bay Packers over the last 35 years. </p>
<p> Given the context of either potentially replacing a player, providing help to a legend, or passing up on potential franchise players, these five picks were probably the worst over the last 35 years. </p>

<p> Turf War: 'Showtime' Paul Fleming taunts part-time model Jackson England ahead of Sydney stoush </p>
<p> At 33 years old and undefeated in 28 fights, flamboyant super featherweight Paul Fleming has plenty to be proud of. </p>

<p> But Fleming, whose intense skip rope sessions match his motormouth interview style, freely admits he has still not reached his boxing potential. </p>
<p> He says he floated by on natural ability at times during his twenties and didn't always make the best decisions. </p>
<p> "You don't heal the same as when you're in your twenties," said Fleming, who will fight Jackson England in the co-main event to Sonny Bill Williams vs Barry Hall on Wednesday. </p>
<p> "But I'm still undefeated, still going hard and I live a pretty clean, physical life... I don't stop, I'm constant. You don't get a chance to stop when you've got five kids and No.6 on the way. Every kid is an extra grey hair and sleepless night, another bill to pay. </p>
<p> "So I just got smarter, not relying on that natural talent to get through everything. If I'm serious about fighting world champions then every per cent counts. </p>
<p> "That last second in the 12th round can be the difference between being world champion or going home and wondering." </p>

<p> "I've fought at the Olympics and some big amateur tournaments overseas. I've done this before and they don't call me 'Showtime' for nothing," he said. </p>
<p> "I turn up and show up, every single time. That pressure of coming to fight me – you know all eyes are going to be on you and that puts enormous pressure on a lot of people. That's going to be the deciding factor in this fight. </p>

<p> "But the experience level, the pressure will get to him and I think he has other options, the young fella. He's a good looking guy, he can rebuild. I'm 34 this year and I should have had my shot a long time ago. </p>
<p> "I should have already had one or two belts draped over my shoulders but what's gone has gone, what's present is present. </p>

<p> Seven-time Formula 1 World Drivers Champion Lewis Hamilton is not happy with the performance level of the new Mercedes car. </p>
<p> Hamilton feels that Ferrari and Red Bull have an advantage over them with the season looming. </p>
<p> Lewis Hamilton says Mercedes have work to do </p>
<p> The former world champion lost out on the title in controversial fashion last season but will have another go at breaking the championships record he shares with Michael Schumacher. </p>
<p> That quest could prove a tough one with Mercedes expected to face fierce competition from both Ferrari and Red Bull for places on the podium. </p>
<p> “We’re not the quickest at the moment, I think Ferrari look to be the quickest. Perhaps Red Bull and then maybe us,” Hamilton said Saturday in Bahrain. “But we’re certainly not at the top.” </p>
<p> The new regulations have forced sweeping changes to the cars and teams have struggled for stability throughout pre-season testing. </p>
<p> Those reliability issues may just render the early part of the championship a crap shoot. </p>
<p> Hamilton said that Mercedes have a lot of work to do before the season starts. </p>
<p> “Everyone’s struggling out on this bumpy track, and we come out of it knowing we still have a lot of work (to do),” Hamilton said. “Everyone’s sliding around, the tires are worse this year.” </p>
<p> Following made easier </p>
<p> Hamilton said that the regulation changes appear to have made it easier to follow, which is meant to allow for more overtaking and racing action. </p>
<p> “The positive so far is following behind other cars feels a little bit better,” Hamilton said. </p>
<p> Reigning champion Max Verstappen topped the timesheets on the final day of Bahrain pre-season testing. </p>
<p> Verstappen’s late flying lap left previous leader Charles Leclerc second, 0.695s off for Ferrari, and Alpine’s Fernando Alonso in P3 having set his fastest lap in the dying minutes. </p>
<p> The 2022 Bahrain Grand Prix, which takes place over 57 laps of the 5.412-kilometre Bahrain International Circuit in Sakhir on Sunday 20 March kicks off the season. </p>

<p> Arsenal's Aubameyang Swaps Football For F1 To Team Up With McLaren Driver Lando Norris </p>
<p> Arsenal talisman Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will partner McLaren driver Lando Norris in a virtually simulated race at the Monaco Grand Prix circuit on Sunday. </p>
<p> Arsenal superstar Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is set to team up with McLaren's Lando Norris for a virtual F1 Grand Prix race around the Monaco street circuit on Sunday. The 'Aubameyang F1' news sent Arsenal fans into a frenzy on social media as the Gabon striker is preparing himself to showcase his pace and skill on the twisty Monaco circuit in a virtual Grand Prix race. With the Formula 1 and Premier League season hampered by the pandemic, the Arsenal talisman will team up with McClaren star Lando Norris on Sunday, for a half-distance race at the Monaco circuit, with both drivers competing from the comfort of their home on simulators. </p>
<p> Aubameyang F1 news: Arsenal star set to race with McLaren </p>
<p> Formula 1 took to Twitter to update Arsenal fans that Aubameyang will be joining F1 giants McLaren for a race on Sunday. The 'Aubameyang F1' news spread like wildfire on social media. Fortunately for Arsenal fans, Aubameyang will remain a McLaren driver from the comfort of his own home. The 30-year-old Aubameyang joins the latest line of high-profile footballers that are taking part in the virtual racing competition to keep fans and themselves in high-spirits amid the coronavirus lockdown. </p>
<p> Earlier this month, Manchester City star Sergio Aguero took part in a similar virtual Grand Prix which was held at a Spanish circuit. Real Madrid shot-stopper Thibaut Courtois and Barcelona's midfield gem Arthur Melo had also taken part in the simulated races. The next player to join that A-list football group of players participating in virtual F1 races is Arsenal forward Aubameyang. </p>
<p> Aubameyang F1 news: Aubameyang to team up with Lando Norris </p>
<p> The Arsenal attacker, who is renowned for his pace and skill, will have to use those traits in the Grand Prix while teaming up with McLaren racer Lando Norris. Norris caught up with Aubameyang ahead of the race and jokingly informed the Gabon captain, 'You'd better be good, you'd better be fast'. The Arsenal star incidentally spent a season on loan at AS Monaco during the 2010-11 season but the tight and twisty Monaco circuit would be unfamiliar surroundings for Aubemayang, albeit through a simulated race. </p>

<p> ICYMI: Behind the scenes from 2020 pre-season testing in Barcelona </p>
<p> You can't be watching social media all the time, so let us help you catch up on some moments you may have missed over the two pre-season tests in Barcelona. </p>
<p> Throwback Thursday </p>
<p> A silver suit? Lewis Hamilton's fashion credentials are well known, and he decided to throw back to his McLaren days in this silver number at the Laureus World Sports Awards, as he mixed with some of the planet's best athletes the weekend before testing. Hamilton co-won the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year Award, along with footballer Lionel Messi. </p>

<p> "What do you mean, you fit in there? At your height?" It seems Barcelona footballers Neto Murara and Arthur Melo weren't too impressed with the tight fit of the R.S.20. </p>

<p> Mercedes raised the bar with their steering system and no one thought they would see anything to rival it. Enter, the revolutionary phone holder. </p>
<p> Lance Stroll brought a bit of skiing couture to the F1 paddock with this number. </p>

<p> It seems Norris isn't done channeling his inner teen just yet. Now whether he also stays in his PJ's until midday remains to be seen. </p>

<p> TECH TUESDAY: The unorthodox rear wing helping McLaren mix it with Mercedes and Red Bull </p>
<p> McLaren have made impressive gains of late – to the point that Lando Norris was able to challenge Max Verstappen’s Red Bull for pole in the Austrian Grand Prix and then run at Mercedes' pace in the race on his way to third place. In this week's Tech Tuesday, Mark Hughes looks at how the team are extracting more pace from the MCL35M, with technical illustrations from Giorgio Piola. </p>
<p> There’s reason to believe that the Red Bull Ring is particularly favourable to the very strong DRS stall characteristic of the McLaren’s rear wing (which has a relatively small main plane and big flap) on a circuit at which the DRS zones represent an untypically big proportion of the lap, helping the car to qualify well (DRS can be used in free air in qualifying). </p>
<p> But even disregarding that, the team seems to be on a productive development curve with the car, with new parts appearing regularly since France. </p>
<p> The first of this tranche of parts was the new rear wing endplate which made its first appearance at Paul Ricard. This is highly distinctive in that the slots in the lower part of the endplate are horizontal rather than the conventional vertical. </p>
<p> The endplate slots in this aerodynamically complex part of the car are there to optimise the airflow between the diffuser and rear wing. They are manipulating the air pressure to give the best overall compromise in the performance of the two downforce-producing components. How fast the air can be induced to exit the diffuser (sometimes referred to as the expansion rate) determines how much downforce the underbody produces. </p>
<p> But maximising that can have an adverse effect on the performance of the wing, starving the outboard ends of airflow as the flow on the wing’s underside is drawn towards the centre by the low pressure of the air exiting the diffuser below. The slots allow the two flows to merge more sympathetically, by drawing some of that air exiting the diffuser out wider. </p>
<p> McLaren uniquely changing these slots from vertical to horizontal suggests it has been seeking a different characteristic across a range of ride heights and attitudes. It may be that this gives a better compromise through more of the running conditions the car sees. The McLaren’s relatively small main plane may have made the wing prone to difficulties when not in DRS mode. </p>
<p> The fact that it has this unique solution may also be connected to its uniquely-configured diffuser, whereby the strakes around the central 500mm form the walls of the central tunnel. In other cars the central tunnel is wider, preventing by regulation the strakes being as long, as they can only extend down as far as they do on the McLaren in the central 500mm. The flow generated by McLaren’s unique diffuser may well have led to the unique horizontal endplate slots. </p>
<p> That unique diffuser design may also be behind McLaren’s outer floor tweak, which appeared for the second Austria race, whereby the previous Z-floor proportions were softened and an impressive array of tiny guide vanes were added around the Z on the edge of the floor. </p>
<p> As discussed in previous Tech Tuesdays, the Z-shaped cut-out induces vortices which help pressure-seal the outer edges of the floor, allowing the main part of the floor to suck the car down harder. But creating that Z-shape by definition robs the floor of some downforce-producing surface area. </p>
<p> McLaren switched to the Z floor in Spain but have now reduced the extremity of the Z, giving it back some floor area. The array of vanes around the Z will be to boost the strength of the vortices around the less-enhanced Z. </p>
<p> McLaren – with a unique diffuser and unusually configured rear wing as hard points of the MCL35M’s basic design – are consequently going very much their own way on development and the car is proving highly responsive to it. </p>
<p> It’s going to be fascinating to see if there is more to come and whether the car’s Austria form can be sustained. </p>

<p> Australia news – Lachlan Henderson named new Cricket Australia chairman </p>
<p> Western Australian becomes the fourth CA chairman in four years, taking over from interim chair Richard Freudenstein, following the resignations of David Peever and Earl Eddings </p>
<p> Cricket Australia has appointed Dr Lachlan Henderson as the new chairman of the board to take over permanently from interim chair Richard Freudenstein. </p>
<p> CA announced on Thursday that Henderson had been unanimously elected by the board following interviews with a short-list of candidates. All state and territory chairs expressed their support for the appointment. Henderson is the current chief executive of Epworth HealthCare having worked in the healthcare industry for 30 years, but he has an extensive background in cricket and cricket administration. </p>
<p> Henderson takes charge of the CA board at a tricky time. He has become the fourth chairman in four years after the resignations of both David Peever in 2018 and Earl Eddings last year. He takes over following Freudenstein’s brief stint as interim chairman during which time both Australia’s Test captain Tim Paine and coach Justin Langer resigned, with Cricket Australia playing a role in both resignations. </p>
<p> Henderson grew up in Western Australia and played state junior cricket for WA as well as first grade in Perth for University Cricket Club. He was chairman of the WACA for two years in 2015-16, having been on the WACA board since 2013, before moving to Melbourne to take up his post with Epworth. He has been an independent director at CA since 2018. </p>
<p> “It is a privilege and honour to be elected chair and serve our national sport,” Henderson said. </p>
<p> “I’m really excited by the opportunities ahead. The CA board is relatively new, with seven of the nine members having been on the board for less than three and a half years, and the imminent appointment of a new independent director will bring further fresh ideas and perspectives to the board. </p>
<p> “My love of cricket began as a kid growing up in Perth and the game has always been a big part of my life, as a player, through my involvement with WA Cricket, the board of Cricket Australia and now as the elected chair. </p>
<p> “I’m looking forward to working closely with our states and territory cricket chairs and associations, the Australian Cricketers’ Association (ACA), our players and our partners, on how we unite and work together to ensure cricket continues to thrive into the future as Australia’s favourite sport. </p>
<p> “As chair, my aim is to ensure the integrity and growth of the game in Australia with strong governance embedded at Cricket Australia and reflected in all levels of cricket, from elite teams to community clubs. </p>
<p> “Among my other main priorities will be a focus on a strong, sustainable financial future for the game and building on the growth in our participation rates, particularly among girls and women, and our multi-cultural communities.” </p>
<p> Freudenstein, who will step down as interim chair immediately but will remain on the CA board, praised Henderson’s appointment. </p>
<p> “Lachlan’s extensive cricket administrative experience and impressive business background, leadership qualities, financial experience and deep understanding of the game ensures that cricket has a new chair who will continue to build unity, trust and respect across all levels of our national sport,” Freudenstein said. </p>
<p> “He brings a combination of fresh ideas, a clear plan and broad experience together with continuity to the position, having served as a CA director for the past three years. </p>
<p> “The short-list of candidates for this role was outstanding but it was the unanimous opinion of the CA board that Lachlan was best suited to be our next chair.” </p>
<p> CA will begin a search to find a new independent director to join the board. </p>

<p> EXCLUSIVE: Former world champion Danny Green breaks down Barry Hall vs Sonny Bill Williams fight </p>
<p> Former world champion Danny Green says the naysayers and sceptics are going to have egg on their face when AFL great Barry Hall starts strutting his stuff in the ring tonight. </p>
<p> "He's 45 years old and moves like a f---ing flyweight," Green told Wide World of Sports ahead of Hall's Turf War heavyweight clash with Sonny Bill Williams. </p>
<p> "He moves like a young man. He really is a phenomenal athlete. It's very impressive." </p>
<p> TURF WAR: Sonny Bill Williams vs Barry Hall, live and exclusive on Stan Event, March 23. Purchase the event now at stan.com.au/event </p>
<p> Green is now Hall's promoter so he is hardly going to talk his man down. </p>
<p> Many seasoned observers believe Hall should have won that fight, including Green. </p>
<p> "I've seen Barry train many times so I'm aware of what he's capable of doing," he said. </p>
<p> "His skill for a big dude... if he had concentrated and put his life into boxing ahead of football, anything's possible for the bloke. Don't worry about age, the bloke's got skill to burn. I watched him last night and he's a f---ing boxer, he ain't a footballer. </p>
<p> "This guy is a boxer now." </p>
<p> Hall weighed in at a lean and mean 97.8kg, giving away more than 11kg to Williams (109.1kg). </p>
<p> He is also nine years older than Williams but Green said he is the full package. </p>
<p> "Everyone knows he's a long, strong boxer, straight shots. He hooks well, he jabs beautifully, right hand, he f---ing uppercuts well. He's got a good bag of tricks." </p>
<p> Green said Williams was also unusually skilled for such a big man who was a footballer for most of his career. </p>
<p> He didn't think either of them would be dancing around and frustrating the punters over eight three-minute rounds. </p>
<p> "They're going to meet in the middle. There's no two ways about it, they're going to meet and it's who gets in first and gets in the best shots and who can impose their will. </p>
<p> "Whoever can impose their will early is going to be the victor." </p>

<p> Ousmane Dembele: Barcelona open fresh talks with winger about a new contract </p>
<p> The club initiated new contact with the 24-year-old's representatives Moussa Sissoko and Marco Lichtsteiner; Barca tried to force the France winger out in January amid a stalemate over an offer that included a significant pay-cut; Dembele's current deal expires on June 30 </p>
<p> Barcelona have approached Ousmane Dembele about a new contract despite trying to force him out in January. </p>
<p> The club initiated contact with the 24-year-old's representatives Moussa Sissoko and Marco Lichtsteiner on Tuesday to propose reopening negotiations. </p>
<p> They have agreed to listen to Barcelona's offer with talks expected to take place in the coming weeks. </p>
<p> It marks a significant turnaround after Barcelona tried to force the France winger out in January amid a stalemate over an offer that included a significant pay-cut, and was made at the same time the club were signing Ferran Torres from Manchester City. </p>

<p> Gary Cotterill reports that Ousmane Dembele is set to stay at Barcelona despite late interest from Chelsea. </p>
<p> But Dembele is now enjoying his football again under Xavi and registering some of the best attacking stats in Europe. He has the best assists-per-minute ratio in the top-five leagues this season, the most assists in Europe since the turn of the year, and the second-most in La Liga all season. </p>
<p> Barcelona vice-president Rafa Yuste said last week that "if Dembele continues to feel comfortable, then we can meet his agents and he could stay", with his current deal expiring on June 30. </p>
<p> Barcelona show interest in Leeds winger Raphinha </p>
<p> Barcelona are hoping a strong relationship with Raphinha's agent Deco - their former player - will help persuade him to join them over Premier League clubs. </p>
<p> President Joan Laporta, in an interview with Catalan radio station RAC1 on Tuesday, confirmed the reports by Sky Sports News regarding the club's rapport with Deco and their interest in the Leeds winger. </p>
<p> Laporta said: "Raphinha is a great player. We have good reports of him. Deco (his agent) has his work and gives us details so that we don't make mistakes. And in some cases it has helped us a lot." </p>
<p> Talks have been ongoing between Leeds and Raphinha over a new contract since last year, but he is yet to sign the terms on offer. </p>
<p> There was significant interest in him from other Premier League teams in January but a move did not materialise. </p>
<p> His future is expected to be back on the agenda again at the end of the season regardless of whether Leeds stay up or go down. </p>
<p> Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player </p>
<p> Marcelo Bielsa felt Leeds’ 2-1 win against Norwich was deserved and praised Raphinha for his special quality which was highlighted with his goal at Carrow Road. </p>
<p> Raphinha's current deal runs until 2024 so Barcelona would have to pay a transfer fee to land him. </p>
<p> They do expect to have a limited pool of cash available to them for some purchases this summer, and hope it will be topped up by player sales, after their serious financial plight was eased somewhat by a new sponsorship deal with Spotify. </p>
<p> Barcelona hope Raphinha's valuation reduces if Leeds are relegated, with Jesse Marsch's side deep in the fight, seven points clear of the drop-zone with eight games left, but having played at least a game more than those below them. </p>
<p> Barcelona will mostly target free transfers this summer, and Sky Sports News has already reported their interest in signing Chelsea duo Andreas Christensen and Cesar Azpilicueta - both set to be free agents in the summer. </p>
<p> Barcelona have already agreed a pre-contract with Ivory Coast midfielder Franck Kessie to join them from AC Milan, and have recently registered their interest in Paulo Dybala now that he has decided not to renew his contract at Juventus. </p>
<p> Premier League clubs monitoring Araujo and Gavi contract talks </p>
<p> Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player </p>
<p> Jamie Redknapp was full of superlatives for 17 year old sensation Gavi's first half display in Spain's Nations League defeat to France. </p>
<p> Premier League clubs are also said to be monitoring the contract disputes ongoing between Barcelona and breakthrough talent Ronald Araujo and Gavi. </p>
<p> Centre-back Araujo's current deal expires in 2024 and he is currently one of the lowest-paid players in the squad despite establishing himself as first-choice alongside Gerard Pique this season. </p>
<p> Barcelona are said to have made a final 'take-it-or-leave-it' offer to the 23-year-old, which would triple his current B-team-level salary, but sources in Spain have told Sky Sports News that Premier League clubs would be willing him pay him more. </p>
<p> The 17-year-old midfielder sensation Gavi finds himself in a similar situation, with just over two years left on his youth terms, and in disagreement over his first pro-deal at the club. </p>
<p> Barcelona are said to value him as an academy graduate that has recently broken into the first-team, but the player feels he should on par with Spain international regulars, which he has become since making his debut for Luis Enrique's vibrant young team last October. </p>
<p> Gavi's situation is also said to be being monitored closely by big clubs across Europe, including from the Premier League, although Liverpool are understood to have no plans to sign him despite reports in Spain that they are interested. </p>
<p> Barcelona vice-president Yuste said this week: "We are working to the best of our abilities to keep Gavi and Araujo at the club. I am optimistic. The players are happy here." </p>

<p> It’s been over two decades since the first Championship Manager game hit the market in 1992, but the appeal of football manager games is nowhere near to fading away. And with all the modern technology we have today, it’s even easier to enjoy the gaming niche, especially with all the free mobile apps found a few taps away. If this rate of designing games continues, we might even forget about playing all those thrilling table games for real money and get back to what we love most – steering our teams through a maze of finances, transfers and tactics, and onto a path of unforgettable glory. </p>
<p> However, as much as living in modern times is convenient for our gaming habits, not every game will stand the test of time and remain as enshrined in our memories as the following installments did. </p>
<p> Football Manager 2007 Although the game wasn’t really perfect, it certainly remains as one of the best football manager games in history. After the previous failure with the 2006 installment, where for some unexplainable reason developers decided to whip out the fictional Harchester United team out of thin air, Football Manager 2007 shook off the criticism and moved with a head held high. </p>
<p> The best thing about the game was the statistics engine which one could easily get lost in for hours, but also the smart design changes which were some of the best at the time. All the little finesses, like sticking experience bars to scouts and deciding to focus more on data than 3D game simulations, made Football Manager 2007 one of the most realistic games in the niche. </p>
<p> LMA Manager 2002 After setting a high bar of expectations with their 2001 version, nobody expected Codemasters to come out with even a better game, and yet they did. One of the best features of the game was the realistic management processes where you could truly build a world-class club only by having real management skills and putting your heart into the game. Everything from stadium finances to the on-field screaming at your players just made the whole experience as real as though your home smelled of soaked grass each time it rained. Plus, the game had a 3D match preview in a time when competitors barely even thought about it. </p>
<p> Football Manager 2005 The reason for including this title on the list is because it was a milestone for Sports Interactive - the game development company that launched it all. Their bitter departure from Eidos left everybody wondering what will the future bring for the franchise, but most importantly: will they fail now that they’ve lost their brand? Well, not only did they didn’t fail but their new franchise burned through Eidos’ release and set a standard that they couldn’t live up to and still can’t to this day. From the meticulous attention to details to its amazing playability, this game had it all. </p>
<p> Championship Manager 2 1995 Even though the 1992 version will forever remain as a breaking point in football gaming, it was the Championship Manager 2 which we’ll all remember enjoying for hours at a time. The 1992 version was good by its own accord, but nobody expected CM2 to go even further and introduce a design which was then seen as pioneering, but is now the standard in football manager games. The game, unsurprisingly, still didn’t have a match engine, but instead came with a whole world of features that laid the addictive foundation on which all subsequent games will rest on. Whoever tried it at the time will surely have hard time remembering anything else apart from its 640x480 screen. </p>
<p> Championship Manager 2001/02 If you ask any fan why they loved this game so much, they’ll probably have hard time explaining it but will still say that it was one of their favorite games. Although it wasn’t particularly innovative, especially when compared to other titles from that time, CM 2001/02 had a groundbreaking approach to playability, nailing a flawless balance between managing and having hours of fun. Unlike the newer, more realistic games of today, this game had the perfect amount of depth but still didn’t require ages before you could call it a season. Its impact on the niche is so major that even to this day people would compare new releases to this game and still put in effort to keep it alive. </p>

<p> Best golfers 25 or younger: Collin Morikawa, Viktor Hovland on best tracks to claim No. 1 in the world status </p>
<p> Morikawa currently sits with the best chance to call himself the best golfer in the world one day </p>
<p> Sungjae Im is nearly two years younger than reigning PGA Tour Rookie of the Year Will Zalatoris and more than a year younger than wunderkind and two-time major winner Collin Morikawa. It often does not feel this way because Im has been a prominent player on the PGA Tour for several years as evidenced by the fact that he won his second Tour event in his 100th PGA Tour start on Sunday at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open. </p>
<p> We tend to evaluate a player's age by how long they have been in our lives. Zalatoris, even though he's significantly older (in sports years) than Im seems younger because we have spent less time with him. Im has played at the highest level -- and often -- ffor several years now which, like players such as Matthew Wolff (22) and Joaquin Niemann (22), belies his actual age. Justin Ray summed it up well in this tweet </p>
<p> Sungjae Im gets his 2nd @PGATOUR win at age 23 years, 6 months, 10 days old. </p>
<p> In the last 50 years, the only players from outside the U.S. to win twice at a younger age: </p>
<p> There are a number of different ways to look at this, and the first is the most obvious. Im is still super young and has a ton of growing to do until he becomes fully formed as a PGA Tour contender. The stats would back this up. Im's strokes gained on approach shots and off the tee have improved season over season during the stretch from 2019-2021. That implies a higher ceiling than what he's reached. </p>
<p> The other way to view this is that he's played 100 PGA Tour events, which is a lot, and has won two of them, which is a decent amount for a golfer in 2021. While he may have up-and-down years over the next decade, the player we have seen over his first 100 tournaments in the best league in the world is more or less the player he's going to be for most of his career. Age gets tossed around as barometer for what could be when players are in their early 20s in all of sports, but most of the time that's simply because we don't have a big sample size of reality. It's easy to dream on the future when nothing has taken place in the present, which is not true in Im's case. </p>
<p> As is almost always the case with situations like this is that the truth probably falls somewhere in the middle. Im's statistical trajectory does imply that he's making marginal (but significant!) improvements, but 100 events is 100 events. Im is a good golfer, but the question now is whether he can be a great one, as Golf Channel analyst Trevor Immelman implied when he said on Sunday during the broadcast that Im could reach No. 1 in the world some day. </p>
<p> Im is currently ranked No. 21 in the Official World Golf Rankings, which is a fabulous achievement. It also means there's a large, Jon Rahm-sized gulf between where he is now and removing the "2" in that number and making it simply, No. 1. </p>
<p> It's a fun exercise to think about, though, and Rahm is an interesting barometer. I took Im as well as all the other golfers currently age 25 or younger and currently in the top 50 in the OWGR and projected the probability that they reach No. 1 in the OWGR at any point in their careers. Here's how I would rank them in the fall of 2021 with so many possibilities and various outcomes in front of them. </p>
<p> Collin Morikawa (24 years old): It seems inevitable that the 24-year-old Morikawa would eventually rise to No. 1 barring a Tiger Woods-like run from Rahm at the top (which could theoretically preclude everyone on this list from reaching No. 1 and is also not that far outside the realm of possibility). From tee to green, Morikawa is mostly Rahm's equal, even though he does it a bit differently. He also has the titles to back up his statistical profile. Current ranking: No. 3 | Probability: 80% </p>
<p> Viktor Hovland (24): He is nearly Morikawa's equal from tee to green, but to reach No. 1 his short game will have to improve quite a bit and he'll have to become a bit more consistent at the majors. The tools are there, and so is the drive. His ranking as the second-highest on this list in the current OWGR matches his odds of reaching No. 1. Current ranking: 15 | Probability: 30% </p>
<p> Sam Burns (25): Burns has been on a heater of late, and he's clearly improved every facet of his game over the last two years. But No. 1 in the world? He was a negative strokes gained on approach player for three straight years from 2018-2020. We don't have all the data on that from every No. 1 player ever, but most of the players who ascended to No. 1 in the world have foretold their arrival with their statistical profile years in advance. Burns can reach the top 10, but he's not a No. 1-type guy. Current ranking: 18 | Probability: 1% </p>
<p> Sungjae Im (23): Only 24 golfers in history have ever been the No. 1 player in the world. Phil Mickelson was never No. 1. It's part luck, part skill, part timing and it would be a surprise if Im, even as a consistent top-20 guy, ever reached that position. His statistical profile is extremely good, and he's performed well at the majors and can win a major at some point. But No. 1 in the world? That's truly rare air, and I don't see it with him. Current ranking: 21 | Probability: 2% </p>
<p> Scottie Scheffler (25): He's a lot longer off the tee than most of the guys on this list, and he was a plus in every strokes gained category last season, but he's going to have to get one win before we start making declarations of No. 1. Current ranking: 23 | Probability: 1% </p>
<p> Joaquin Niemann (22): The numbers are extraordinary, his ball flight perhaps even more so. He's also such a joy to watch when he's feeling it. However, I think he's another in that Burns-Im class where you can envision him being No. 8 in the world but not necessarily No. 1. Current ranking: 30 | Probability: 2% </p>
<p> Will Zalatoris (25): We have the least amount of PGA Tour data on Zalatoris, which could benefit him. His numbers are astounding. He was actually better than Rahm on approach shots last season, though he trailed mightily off the tee. If he was 21 years old and not 25, I'd be more inclined to give him a nod. Current ranking: 31 | Probability: 2% </p>
<p> Matthew Wolff (22): His numbers aren't as good as most of the other players on this list, but there's some magic in there. He's still so young -- the youngest on this list other than Garrick Higgo -- and the gifts, anecdotally, are magnificent. I think you'd like to see the trajectory develop a bit over the next 2-3 years as he hopefully settles nicely into PGA Tour life, but his ceiling is higher than everybody here other than Morikawa and possibly Hovland. Current ranking: 33 | Probability: 4% </p>
<p> Garrick Higgo (22): He's been a good player thus far, but nothing about his statistical profile or pedigree suggests that he will ever be the No. 1 player in the world. In fact, it would be a bit of a surprise if he ever rose into the top 10 in the OWGR. Current ranking: 49 | Probability: <1% </p>

<p> Boston Celtics: 2 players who should be Defensive Player of the Year candidates </p>
<p> Boston Celtics guard Payton Pritchard (11) Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports </p>
<p> The Boston Celtics magical 2021-22 season continues. With another dominant win over the Utah Jazz on Wednesday night, the C’s have now won five straight games, and continue to move their way up the Eastern Conference standings. </p>
<p> The dominance asserted during these wins has been quite impressive. Over the last five games, Boston has built up at least a 24 point lead at one point or another in each of those wins. These wins aren’t coming against light competition either. They have managed to do this against high quality competition such as the Golden State Warriors, Denver Nuggets, and the aforementioned Jazz. </p>
<p> It’s been a blend of the Celtics offensive game finally matching the heights that their defensive game has been at all season long. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown are good for 25+ points a night at this point, and the rest of the rotation features players all capable of chipping in at least 10-15 points on any given night. It’s really just a matter of who ends up with the hot hand. </p>
<p> While it’s been great to see the team scoring consistently, the C’s defensive efforts continue to remain a hot topic of conversation. Their defense has been fantastic all season long, and while it’s largely been a team effort, there are two players in particular that have stood out, and are beginning to see their names mentioned in the Defensive Player of the Year conversation. Let’s look at those two players, and review their DPOY cases as the end of the regular season nears. </p>

<p> Tennis: Boxing </p>
<p> Boxing in the professional sporting world is a discipline that requires high amounts of focus, determination and peak fitness conditioning from competing athletes. The sport uses a combination of dexterity, coordination, speed and strength as two fighters face off with protective gloves aiming to beat each other by achieving higher point score given by a panel of judges or by knocking out the opponent, which is judged to have happened when they stay down for a maximum of 10 seconds. </p>
<p> Boxing is one of the oldest documented sports in history and among the most entertaining in the professional sporting world. In 2015, one match coined "Fight of the Century" between boxing greats Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao generated $A1.23 billion through pay-per-view subscriptions and ticket sales. The allure of boxing for many athletes is the promise of glory and prestige. Over recent years there have been many cross-over attempts by professional athletes attempting to make a name for themselves in the boxing industry, often in a chase of money. Among these is household NRL great Paul Gallen currently sporting an 11-1-0 undefeated pro boxing career, one of Australia's great athletes to make headlines across two different sports. Conor McGregor was yet another cross-over boxer coming from a mixed-martial arts background. McGregor is the former UFC champion in two weight classes (featherweight and lightweight). McGregor's matchup against Floyd Mayweather went on to the be the second highest pay-per-view fight just trailing behind the Mayweather-Pacquiao bout at $A1.2 billion. </p>

Conor McGregor was yet another cross-over boxer coming from a mixed-martial arts background. McGregor is the former UFC champion in two weight classes (featherweight and lightweight). McGregor's matchup against Floyd Mayweather went on to the be the second highest pay-per-view fight just trailing behind the Mayweather-Pacquiao bout at $A1.2 billion. </p>

<p> News: Boxing </p>
<p> Boxing in the professional sporting world is a discipline that requires high amounts of focus, determination and peak fitness conditioning from competing athletes. The sport uses a combination of dexterity, coordination, speed and strength as two fighters face off with protective gloves aiming to beat each other by achieving higher point score given by a panel of judges or by knocking out the opponent, which is judged to have happened when they stay down for a maximum of 10 seconds. </p>
<p> Boxing is one of the oldest documented sports in history and among the most entertaining in the professional sporting world. In 2015, one match coined "Fight of the Century" between boxing greats Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao generated $A1.23 billion through pay-per-view subscriptions and ticket sales. The allure of boxing for many athletes is the promise of glory and prestige. Over recent years there have been many cross-over attempts by professional athletes attempting to make a name for themselves in the boxing industry, often in a chase of money. Among these is household NRL great Paul Gallen currently sporting an 11-1-0 undefeated pro boxing career, one of Australia's great athletes to make headlines across two different sports.

<p> Boxing media review: Promoter versus lawyer </p>
<p> In the absence of Fury and Whyte we get a slanging match between a promoter and a lawyer, writes George Gigney in his boxing media review </p>
<p> IF we’re not going to get any confrontations in the media between Tyson Fury and Dillian Whyte ahead of their Wembley clash next month, we may just have had the closest thing to it this past week. Frank Warren, who co-promotes Fury, and Jeffrey Benz, Whyte’s legal representation, were both invited onto talkSPORT to discuss the fight. No points for anyone who guessed it would not be a pleasant conversation. </p>
<p> There was a lot of talk about contracts, legal obligations, agreements and disputes. There was no talk of fighting. </p>
<p> This was by design, though; the strained relationship between the two teams on either side of this fight is well known. talkSPORT knew what it was doing here. </p>
<p> The segment was both entertaining and a little embarrassing. In which other sport would you have a veteran businessman and a lawyer shouting at each other on a radio show about negotiations for a contract that has already been signed? </p>
<p> If the issues raised during this conversation – most importantly whether or not Dillian Whyte’s guaranteed purse should be put into an escrow account until the fight takes place – are still as prevalent as they were made out to be, this clearly wasn’t the platform to discuss them on. </p>
<p> We even heard about Whyte’s team disputing the way he was portrayed on the official fight poster. It’s pettiness on steroids. The sad reality is that this isn’t that uncommon in boxing; there are so many tiny details that need to be agreed to with fights of this scale. </p>
<p> What’s happened in recent years is that we’re being shown more and more of how the sausage is made. Negotiations aren’t played out behind closed doors anymore; we’re given updates – sometimes on a daily basis – about what’s going on. </p>
<p> For some, this is a good thing. But mostly it’s just nauseating. Please, leave us out of it. If not purely for the fact that it’ll lead to fewer legal experts popping up on social media. </p>
<p> When it comes to documentaries, few sports provide such a rich content pool as boxing, though the focus is usually on more well-known names. Last week BT Sport premiered an excellent one-off titled M14: A Moss Side Story. </p>
<p> Its focus was legendary Manchester trainer – and former fighter – Phil Martin. Though somewhat of a mythical figure among a certain generation of the British boxing world, Martin’s impact on the sport and his community might not be so well-known to others. </p>
<p> This documentary does a great job of bringing that to light, featuring interviews and soundbites from countless fighters and trainers who worked with Martin. What really came through, though, was the impact he had on those around him. </p>
<p> Having died from cancer at the age of 44, Martin’s life and career was cruelly cut short but he is clearly remembered by the boxing world. Websites </p>
<p> It seems we might be experiencing an encouraging trend developing wherein fighters are willing to align with different promoters in order to make the best fights possible. It’s emerged – though not officially confirmed – that Devin Haney will move from Matchroom and DAZN to Top Rank and ESPN to finalise a fight with George Kambosos Jnr. </p>
<p> Demetrius Andrade’s contract with DAZN and Matchroom is also set to end and according to Eddie Hearn will not be renewed. Lastly, Gervonta Davis is said to be leaving Mayweather Promotions after his next fight. </p>
<p> Andrade is the outlier here as he is much closer to the end of his career than the other two, however it’s still an interesting development. He’s been unable to nail down the marquee fights his career has so far been missing. </p>
<p> Despite it looking like he and Kambosos were destined to just Tweet at each other until the end of time, Haney appears to be stepping up to the mark and should be applauded for it. According to ESPN, his contract with DAZN has expired and he will now sign with Top Rank to fight on ESPN. Obviously, in an ideal world, fighters shouldn’t have to tie themselves down to one platform (see: the success of Canelo Álvarez) but this is a step in the right direction. Young fighters knowing their worth and being willing to take their talents elsewhere for bigger fights (and purses) is only a good thing. </p>
<p> Gareth A Davies spoke to Wladimir and Vitaliy Klitschko for the Telegraph, producing an impactful and important article. The two brothers are, of course, in Ukraine not only defending their home country against Vladimir Putin’s invasion but also providing much-needed sources of inspiration and strength. </p>
<p> It’s difficult to put into words the strength these two men have displayed over the past month, though Davies treats the interview with an appropriate amount of reverence and context. </p>
<p> The Klitschkos also spoke about their compatriot, Oleksandr Usyk, leaving Ukraine to prepare for a rematch with Anthony Joshua. Both gave him their support and spoke about how important it could be for Ukrainians to see one of their most accomplished athletes fly the flag on the grandest of stages. </p>
<p> While Barstool Sports is not a place you’d expect to find much nuance or insight, it was still disappointing to read their piece on Australians Ebanie Bridges and Skye Nicolson. Both are clearly talented and have proven themselves very marketable, yet this Barstool article focused almost exclusively on their looks. </p>
<p> There was at least some self-awareness in the piece (the writer referring to himself as a “mouth-breather” and his readers as “knuckle-draggers”) but that didn’t stop it from ending on a note of “enjoy the tits.” </p>
<p> Even if it were tongue-in-cheek – which really isn’t clear – it’s still grossly misogynistic. Barstool Sports doesn’t cover boxing much – and women’s boxing even less so – but if this is what they come out with then the sport is probably better off without their attention. </p>

<p> Tyson Fury Accuses Anthony Joshua Of Copying Him </p>
<p> Tyson Fury mocks Anthony Joshua by calling him a copy cat. According to Tyson Fury, he is the first to do things and then boxers copy him. Know more about it. </p>
<p> Tyson Fury is currently feuding with Braun Stroman ‘The Monster Among Men’ for their upcoming fight in WWE Crown Jewel. However, that didn’t stop The Gypsy King to take a dig at his Boxing World contemporaries. A few days back, Fury took the combat sports universe by storm after declaring his MMA debut this year and this time he did not hesitate to take a dig at Anthony Joshua. According to Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua has always copied him which also includes the upcoming WWE Crown Jewel venue. </p>
<p> Boxing News: What did Anthony Joshua copy? </p>
<p> Anthony Joshua tasted defeat for the first time in his life on June against Andy Ruiz Jr. and he has faced heavy backlash from his contemporaries and boxing fans since then. The re-match is going to take place in December at Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and Joshua gets a chance to get back all his lost belts. However, The Gypsy King has recently stated that Joshua copies everything he does and ‘The Clash on the Dunes’ is nothing different. </p>
<p> Tyson Fury is going to face Braun Strowman in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia for the upcoming WWE PPV Crown Jewel in the same spot where Joshua and Ruiz are going to lock their horns after five weeks from Crown Jewel. The Morecambe Giant talked about his bout against Wladimir Klitschko. Both Fury and Joshua has tasted victory against Wladimir but according to Fury, he was the first man to beat Wladimir and Joshua just decided to copy him. </p>
<p> “It was the same with Wladimir. I took him first and then they had the leftovers” said Tyson Fury. </p>
<p> Boxing News: Will Tyson Fury fight Anthony Joshua </p>
<p> Fury is on the line with Braun Strowman for WWE Universe while Anthony Joshua is looking forward to revenge his loss against Andy Ruiz Jr. in the re-match. Tyson Fury could return to the boxing ring after his WWE fight, but he has shown almost no interest in fighting Anthony Joshua. As per The Gypsy King, he will only face Anthony Joshua manages to win the re-match against Ruiz. The Lineal Heavyweight champion feels that he is in the twilight of his career and there is a very less probability of seeing Fury vs Joshua but that won't stop The Gypsy King from keeping up the beef outside the boxing ring. </p>

<p> 3 reasons the Braves will be even better without Freddie Freeman </p>
<p> Atlanta Braves first baseman Freddie Freeman. (Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports) </p>
<p> The Atlanta Braves let Freddie Freeman leave and may be better for it. </p>
<p> The biggest storyline with the Atlanta Braves this winter was whether or not Freddie Freeman would return to the only professional organization he has ever known. Fresh off of winning the World Series, it was practically a given that they would award this generation’s Chipper Jones with a brand new contract. </p>
<p> Once they entered the MLB lockout without a new deal, the odds swayed a little more in favor of the two sides parting ways. Rumors swirled all lockout long. Ultimately, the Braves blinked first and decided to pull off a trade with the Oakland Athletics to acquire Matt Olson to play first base. </p>
<p> Freeman is now a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers where he’ll hope to take down his former team if they meet in the playoffs. The Braves are still hoping to win it all again this year. In fact, for these three reasons, they may be better off without Freeman. </p>
<p> The Braves may have actually upgraded at first base with Matt Olson </p>
<p> Matt Olson is coming off of a monster year with the Athletics where he slashed .271/.371/.540 with 39 home runs and 111 RBI. It was easily his best big league season yet. Along with some superb defensive skills which include a pair of Gold Gloves in the past, the younger first baseman could very well have a much better season than Freeman. </p>
<p> This isn’t to discount what Freeman was able to do for the Braves last year or years prior. He has regularly been in the MVP conversation. In the shortened 2020 campaign, he took it home. </p>
<p> Freeman batted .300/.393/.503 for Atlanta last year with 31 home runs and 83 RBI. However, as he enters his age 32 season with Olson playing this season at 28, there’s a strong possibility we begin to see the younger of the two first basemen trend up with the older trend downward. </p>
<p> The pair could very well enter this season on equal footing. Long-term, however, there’s a much better chance Olson gives the Braves more successful seasons than Freeman can for the Dodgers. </p>

<p> Brawn hopes F1 rules revolution attracts Williams buyer </p>
<p> Formula One motorsport boss Ross Brawn is confident the new rules laid out for the sport over the next few years will help the Williams team attract a new buyer. </p>
<p> Williams is prepared to end decades family control of the team as part of a new strategic direction to revive its F1 fortunes. The team, founded by Frank Williams, is one of the most successful in the championship's history, winning a string of titles in the 1980s and 1990s. </p>
<p> F1 has moved to future-proof the sport during the coronavirus pandemic, agreeing on a budget cap which will be scaled back from $145 million in 2021 to $135 m by 2023. It will also introduce a sliding scale of aerodynamic development weighted in reverse order of championship finish, in other words giving the team which finishes 10th the most car development time in a windtunnel the following year. </p>
<p> Brawn hopes those new regulations will make investing in Williams, which has finished bottom of the order two years in a row, a good option for any interested parties. </p>
<p> "I think what's encouraging is there are quite a lot of sensible people looking at Williams because they can see the opportunities in the future," Brawn told Racer. "I think they can see the improving landscape for Formula 1 - economically, commercially, and the competitiveness that an independent team should have in the future. </p>
<p> "I think they see it as a prime time, even in these extremely challenging times they still see it as an opportunity. So I think there's every chance Williams will be taking on some new partners in the future. </p>
<p> "We'd like to see it stay as Williams, and stay with the heritage and history of Williams. It's a great team and we'd like to retain that. I think there's some fairly sensible people now looking at the opportunity to get involved with Williams and give it the support it needs to be successful in the future." </p>
<p> The F1 season is set to start on July 5 at a behind-closed-doors Austrian Grand Prix. The race will take place under strict protocols to prevent the spread of Covid-19. </p>

<p> Brazil set new South American World Cup qualifying record </p>
<p> Brazil break Argentina's record for the most points in a South American qualifying group ahead of the 2022 World Cup with their latest victory. </p>
<p> Brazil have set a brand new South American World Cup qualifying record following their victory over Bolivia. </p>
<p> Brazil have amassed 45 points from their 17 games in qualifying, which is a new record for the highest number any team has secured in the history of the group. </p>
<p> They overtook Argentina's efforts during the 2002 group, where Marcelo Bielsa's team managed to gain 43 points from all of their fixtures. </p>
<p> The Canarinho still have one more match to play against the White and Sky Blue, but they will top the group ahead of the tournament in Qatar later this year regardless of that result. </p>
<p> Brazil are also set to be back in the number one slot of the FIFA World Rankings after Belgium were held to a draw in their most recent match against Republic of Ireland. </p>

<p> 3 NBA legends you forgot played for the Brooklyn Nets </p>
<p> These five legends are known for their incredible play on different teams, but here we take a look back at their time with the Brooklyn Nets </p>
<p> The Brooklyn Nets, formally known as the New Jersey Nets, are composed of superstars. From the sharpshooting Kevin Durant to Kyrie Irving, who possesses handles that have left many defenders in awkward positions. The Nets have come a long way from being in the shadow of their cross-city rival the New York Knicks. Durant and Irving’s star power alone is sure to sell out arenas in any city. </p>
<p> With the addition of these superstars come new fans, and many may not know that before there was Durant, and Irving, and before the Nets moved to Brooklyn, the Nets were once home to these three NBA legends. </p>
<p> 3. Stephon Marbury on the Brooklyn Nets (1999-2000) </p>
<p> The Brooklyn native, Stephen Marbury, was traded to the Nets in 1999 in a nine-player deal involving the Timberwolves and Milwaukee Bucks. Marbury and the Timberwolves were at odds because Kevin Garnett signed a $126 million rookie extension, which left them with the max offer of $70 million for Marbury on his next contract. Between Marbury’s camp being offended by the deal and him no longer wanting to be in Minnesota, he decided to force a trade to the Nets. </p>
<p> The Nets were a struggling team. They were 3-15 to start the season and were in desperate need of someone who could turn the ailing franchise around. Lewis Katz, one of the Nets owners, at the time felt Marbury was the perfect guy for this role, according to Nets then-coach, John Calipari, per the NY Times. </p>
<p> ”Marbury is a fighter,” he said. ”He’s a warrior. He’s a leader. He’s fearless. </p>
<p> Adding Marbury to the Nets did not make much of a difference. The Nets would go a measly 31-51 and 26-56 in the two full seasons that Marbury was a part of the team. </p>
<p> In 2001 Marbury was traded by the Nets to the Phoenix Suns for Jason Kidd. Although Marbury’s stint with the Nets was short-lived, and his tenure with the team did not produce the results the owners may have wanted, he did manage to average 22 points a game and be voted an NBA All-Star. </p>

<p> Big-hitting American star Bryson DeChambeau has withdrawn from this week’s Players Championship at famed TPC Sawgrass. </p>
<p> DeChambeau gave no reason for the withdrawal, but is presumably still dealing with the injury problems that prevented him from defending his title at last week’s Arnold Palmer Invitational. </p>
<p> DeChambeau, the world No 12, has been dealing with hip and hand injuries for much of the season, and has only started three PGA Tour events. </p>
<p> DeChambeau’s last appearance was in early February at the Saudi International where he withdrew after the first round. </p>
<p> Bryson DeChambeau finished third last year </p>
<p> Last week, DeChambeau said he believed he was around 90% fit, though he wasn’t fully comfortable when hitting balls. </p>
<p> “At this current point in time I’ve got to take another week off and I’m going to try and get back and play for The Players but as of right now I just can’t risk having it re-aggravate,” he said at the time. </p>
<p> DeChambeau finished in a tie for third place in last year’s Players Championship, two shots behind winner Justin Thomas. </p>
<p> Hayden Buckley will replace DeChambeau in the 144-player field, the PGA Tour confirmed. </p>

<p> Bulls legend Dennis Rodman explains why he doesn't watch the NBA </p>

<p> Legendary basketball player Dennis Rodman was a star on the court for the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls during his playing days in the 90s, however, the five-time NBA champion isn’t much of a fan of the league that helped him gain his fame. </p>
<p> During Rodman’s era, the NBA was known for its toughness. During a recent interview on the "Full Send" podcast, Rodman says the league is hard to watch because of how much it has changed. </p>
<p> "I don’t know, it’s just very hard to watch because once you’ve played the game the way we played it intensity, just competitiveness," Rodman said via Clutch Points. "But now it’s more like you know I don’t want to watch players coming down shooting 50 footers, you know. That’s not basketball." </p>
<p> Golden State Warriors guard Steph Curry and other three-point shooters have transformed a league that was built on physicality in the paint into a new era where teams now live-and-die by 3-pointers. Rodman, who was a key figure in Michael Jordan’s documentary "The Last Dance", added that the NBA is "difficult to watch, but a lot of kids love it." </p>
<p> During Rodman’s final season with the Bulls in 1997-98, Chicago attempted 11.7 three-pointers per game. To put that into context, Curry attempted 12.7 threes per game while hitting 42.1 percent of his shots from beyond-the-arc. </p>

<p> Charlie Woods, who turned 13 last month, has played with his father in the PNC Championship. They finished runner-up in December, drawing enormous publicity because it was the first time Woods played since serious injuries to his right leg in a car crash. </p>
<p> Hall of Fame member Davis Love III will be introducing retired PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem. Another Hall of Fame member, Judy Rankin, will introduce three-time U.S. Women's Open champion Susie Maxwell Berning. </p>

<p> Novak Djokovic splits with long-time coach Marian Vajda, according to reports </p>
<p> Novak Djokovic has split with his longtime coach Marian Vajda, who has been with the Serbian for all 20 major titles that he's won. </p>
<p> Tennis Majors revealed that the pair mutually agreed to part ways following last year's ATP Finals in Turin in November. </p>
<p> Vajda and Djokovic have been together for more than 15 years, having first worked together in early 2006. </p>
<p> There was a brief split in 2017-18, a period where Djokovic struggled with an elbow problem. </p>
<p> Goran Ivanisevic, who has been part of Djokovic's team since the middle of 2019, will coach the Serbian. </p>
<p> Leading journalist Sasa Ozmo also reports that Djokovic has split with sponsor Peugeot, although the Serbian's anti-vaccination stance is not believed to be the reason behind the move. </p>
<p> Djokovic, who this week officially lost the world No.1 ranking to Daniil Medvedev, is likely to play a reduced schedule this year because of his refusal to be vaccinated. </p>
<p> "As of today, no. I can't go – can't enter United States," he said last week. </p>
<p> "As of today I'm not able to play. But let's see what happens. I mean, maybe things change in the next few weeks." </p>

<p> Cade Cunningham to 'play free' after getting past injury-delayed Detroit Pistons debut </p>
<p> Cunningham missed the entire preseason and the first four games of the regular season because of a sprained ankle suffered during training camp. He went through team drills on Friday before being cleared to play, but was under a minutes restriction of 20 to 25 minutes. </p>
<p> He had 2 points, 7 rebounds and 2 assists in 18 minutes. His 2 points were the fewest scored in a No. 1 pick's NBA debut since Anthony Bennett in 2013, who also ended with 2 points. </p>
<p> However, he saw things differently from his perspective, notably coming off an injury. </p>
<p> "I think it was good. I feel like coming in, just being able to make some plays off the ball, get some rebounds. I felt like I was solid defensively," Cunningham said. "And, I mean those are the points that I really wanted to come out and just prove to myself that my ankle was straight and that I could move, guard and do everything else. So, I got all the jitters out now and now I can just go play free." </p>
<p> Cunningham said he felt anxious to finally hit the court after being sidelined for so long. His lone basket came off a gliding layup up the middle of the lane at 5:10 in the second quarter. </p>
<p> "I wouldn't say it was anything I didn't envision or I couldn't imagine it being like," Cunningham said. "But, whenever you step out there, it's always different than what you might've had in your head as far as once you get out there, all the time you spent trying to prepare your mind for it, once you get out there, you're still gonna feel the over-excitement of just wanting to play." </p>
<p> Cunningham called it tough to watch his teammates from the sideline, but he received support throughout the process. </p>
<p> His first game marks 40 years to the day after franchise legend Isiah Thomas made his Pistons debut with 31 points and 11 assists against the Milwaukee Bucks. </p>
<p> "What a coincidence and a pleasant surprise to be reminded of such great memories," Thomas told ESPN. "Truly unforgettable beginning with Detroit and the Pistons." </p>
<p> In winning their first game of the season, Detroit avoided its first 0-5 start since 2012-13. Pistons coach Dwane Casey also stressed that Cunningham shouldn't feel pressure to "save the day." </p>
<p> "Exactly what I thought, I knew it was gonna be rust, timing and just the whole thing," Casey said. "You can't go a month and come out and expect to play the way you want to play, but I liked the effort, the intensity he played with, the way he pushed the ball, moved the ball, tried to make the right decisions and that's what we needed, the ball movement." </p>
<p> Cunningham shot 1-for-8 from the field (12.5 percent). That is the second-worst field goal percentage by a No. 1 overall pick in his NBA debut in the Modern Draft Era (since 1966). Bennett shot 0-for-5 in his debut. </p>
<p> Although he'll be compared to previous top picks frequently, the Pistons rookie will try to create his own narrative in the league. </p>
<p> "You don't have to listen to everything. I mean, they could say it, but it's all about if I put my ears to it and really let it resonate with me," Cunningham said. "I try to keep my energy in the right place. I try to keep my head in the right place and so, my team, they know what they expect out of me, I know what I expect out of me, so that's all that's really mattering to me. People can say whatever they want, outside of that, but I probably won't hear it." </p>

<p> Cameron Smith wins the Players Championship at Sawgrass </p>
<p> Australia's Cameron Smith hits a magnificent 10 birdies during his final round to win the Players Championship at Sawgrass. </p>
<p> Cameron Smith has won the Players Championship at Sawgrass, hitting a magnificent 10 birdies during his final round on Monday. </p>
<p> The Australian went toe-to-toe with a packed leaderboard, the majority of them looking for the biggest wins of their careers, but it was the 28-year-old who got over the line for a one-shot win. </p>
<p> A stunning approach to the famous 17th led to Smith establishing a three-shot lead, although it took a two-foot putt on the last to earn a tournament-clinching double bogey. </p>
<p> In response to Smith's 66, previous leader Anirban Lahiri shot a final-round 69, only missing out on forcing a playoff when his chip for birdie on the last came up short. </p>
<p> The Indian player pushed Paul Casey into third after the Englishman had stuck with Smith for the majority of the day, while Kevin Kisner and Keegan Bradley made up the top five. </p>
<p> Scotland's Russell Knox was one of three players to earn a share of sixth, with Dustin Johnson miraculously earning a top-10 finish courtesy of producing a 63, moving 50 places up the leaderboard. </p>
<p> Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry were among a group to share 13th position, but Rory McIlroy was left to salvage 34th place through hitting a round of 66 on Monday. </p>

<p> Can cricket make it in the U.S.? A new league aims to elevate the game and find out </p>
<p> Founders of Major League Cricket, expected to start in 2022, say they hope to reach South Asian American fans who yearn for the chance to cheer for a local team. </p>

<p> By Lakshmi Gandhi </p>
<p> The storied British game of cricket was the top sport in the United States in the mid-1800s. Now, the backers of a new league believe Americans will once again embrace professional cricket — and they are putting their dollars behind a new league to prove it. </p>
<p> Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and a host of Indian American tech executives, including Microsoft Chairman Satya Nadella, are among the prominent investors in Major League Cricket, a professional league that will begin playing matches in 2022. The league originally intended to launch later this year, but it pushed back operations because of the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>
<p> League co-founders say they hope to tap into a market of fans — the vast majority of whom hail from South Asia and the Caribbean — who yearn for the chance to root for a local professional team. </p>
<p> "There is a huge amount of demand from the U.S.-based audience to consume the sport in person," said Sameer Mehta, a co-founder of Major League Cricket. Mehta said the U.S. is second only to India in terms of the number of fans who travel abroad to see matches each year and was home to one of the top five media markets for the game in the world. </p>
<p> Major League Cricket says it plans to begin with six teams in major cities. One team has been announced in Dallas; the other cities will be rolled out in the months ahead. "Some of them would be obvious, like the New York/New Jersey area and the San Francisco Bay Area," Major League Cricket co-founder Vijay Srinivasan said. </p>
<p> Mehta and Srinivasan said the intense passion fans have for cricket is evidence of the sport's unique appeal. There is "a lot of culture, history and tradition and dynamism" connected to cricket, Mehta said. "It's ingrained in people who've experienced it and have fallen in love with it as children." </p>
<p> Mehta said that fans sign up for highly specialized cable packages and streaming services to watch cricket matches and that the game is already being played in parks across the country. </p>
<p> "If you are in the San Francisco Bay Area on a Sunday morning, it's mostly tennis ball cricket being played on all the grounds, as opposed to traditionally what used to be baseball or even soccer," Mehta said. "Multitudes of fields are taken over on weekends by expats playing cricket." </p>
<p> American fans' enthusiasm for the game backs that up. When Shiek Mohamed, the founder of the popular news website USA Cricketers, heard about the launch of Major League Cricket, "I had to pinch myself," he said. </p>
<p> Mohamed, who immigrated to the New York area from Guyana in the 1990s, was inspired to begin USA Cricketers when he realized that many fans wanted to keep up with cricket news but did not have a U.S.-based source to do so. "So hearing about Major League Cricket and how it plans to become something like the Indian Premier League or other high-end tournaments was great news," he said. </p>
<p> For parents who grew up playing the game, having a way to pass the sport along felt particularly important. Sreekanth Kannepalli founded the Tuskers Youth Cricket Academy in Seattle so his kids and others could play cricket competitively. </p>
<p> "My son wanted to play, and I was, like, there's nobody to teach here, so I took it on myself," Kannepalli said. The academy quickly drew interest from families in the area; Kannepalli guessed that most of the kids who have enrolled have roots in South Asia or in Australia and New Zealand. </p>
<p> Kannepalli said that as a fan, he is eager for Major League Cricket to launch in the U.S. </p>
<p> "Most of us are very passionate about this sport," he said. "My affinity is towards the Indian national team, so I follow their games. I watch them till 3 in the morning." </p>
<p> The passion was evident when the new league approached potential investors. </p>
<p> "They saw this as a way to, one, connect with what they love," Mehta said. In addition to Nadella, the league's prominent tech investors include Shantanu Narayen, the CEO and chairman of Adobe; SQN hedge fund manager Amish Mehta; Neeraj Arora, former chief business officer of WhatsApp; and Subrah Iyar, who founded WebEx and is an investor in Zoom Video Communications, according to a news release. </p>
<p> If cricket were to achieve mainstream popularity in the U.S. because of the new league, it would be reclaiming part of its American past. </p>
<p> Until the mid-1800s, the game was equally as popular as baseball throughout the country. But as the historian George Kirsch noted in "Baseball and Cricket: The Creation of American Team Sports," cricket's pace couldn't keep up with American tastes. </p>
<p> "American players thought that cricket was a slow sport because they batted a few times per game, and had little action in the field," Kirsch said in an email. By contrast, baseball allowed players to bat several times a game and field a position every half-inning. </p>
<p> Traditional cricket is known for long matches that can span several days, but the new league will play a newer, shorter form of the game known as Twenty20, which limits matches to about three hours. "It's very fast-moving. It has a tremendous amount of action," Mehta said. "It allows players to play with a lot of freedom." </p>
<p> League officials say the Major League Cricket schedule will run during the summer in the U.S., which makes it ideal for attracting international talent because it doesn't overlap with most other leagues' seasons. Organizers said teams are likely to include former professional players living in the U.S. and younger players playing on college teams and with clubs. </p>
<p> Many former professional athletes are eager to play the game seriously again. League officials saw that when they held a minor-league tournament last fall. "We got about 4,000 people registered in the draft," Mehta said. "We looked through the names, and there were dozens upon dozens of very, very high-quality names in there." </p>
<p> The league is confident that with the right mix of talent, it will be able to field competitive teams for an eager fan base. </p>
<p> "If they could just drive a few miles away and watch top-tier international cricket with their local teams participating and get to root for a team called San Francisco or a team called New York — I think as long as we don't screw up on the product itself, it will be wonderful," Mehta said. </p>
<p> CORRECTION (Feb. 4, 2021, 3:37 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article mischaracterized the cricket audience in the U.S. It is second only to India in the number of fans who travel abroad to watch matches, not in overall size. </p>

<p> 5 players Chicago Bears could target with Khalil Mack pick </p>
<p> The dust has settled. The Chicago Bears are really moving forward without Khalil Mack. </p>
<p> When general manager Ryan Poles decided to trade Mack, he signaled that a rebuild was imminent. Fortunately, the Bears aren’t in a bad position. </p>
<p> The Bears have one thing that many teams don’t have when entering a rebuild, and that is a young, franchise quarterback like Justin Fields. </p>
<p> Now, it’s all about building around Fields. Poles dealt Mack in order to take some pressure off the salary cap in future and to also obtain some extra draft capital. </p>
<p> What players will be available for the Chicago Bears with the pick they received in the Khalil Mack trade? </p>
<p> In the Mack trade, the Bears received two picks from the Los Angeles Chargers: A second-round pick this year and a sixth-round pick next year. The second rounder this year lands at pick no. 48. </p>
<p> At that spot, the Bears very well could land a starter for years to come. This year’s draft class is one of the deeper classes in recent memory, and all four of the top rounds possess plenty of starting talent. </p>
<p> Chicago’s holes go way beyond just one or two positions now, but everybody is focused on a few key needs. The Bears have to surround Fields with wide receivers to play alongside Darnell Mooney. They also need offensive line help, and one could argue at any position up front. </p>
<p> Defensive line and linebacker are also now areas of need after the Bears released guys like Eddie Goldman and Danny Trevathan. Of course, cornerback remains a hot spot, too. </p>
<p> At that pick no. 48, the Bears will have some attractive options to meet some needs. Let’s take a look at a few select players who could be available at that point in the 2022 NFL Draft. </p>

<p> 3 trades the Chicago Bears should attempt in coming days </p>
<p> This Chicago Bears offseason has been a highly-unique one thus far. For several years, the Bears have been under the leadership of former general manager Ryan Pace. </p>
<p> What Pace brought to the table was a much different approach in free agency, as he spent quite a bit of money in comparison to other NFL general managers — and the contracts weren’t always sensible. </p>
<p> Poles, on the other hand, has taken a more patient approach. He has made a good amount of signings so far, but none of them have been in the high-dollar range. Similarly. They’ve all been shorter contracts. </p>
<p> The one huge move Poles has made saw the Bears ship Khalil Mack off to the Los Angeles Chargers. It’s clear he’s building for the future and not this year, and the sooner fans realize that, the better. </p>
<p> Chicago Bears GM Ryan Poles should continue to transform this roster by attempting another trade or two. </p>
<p> Other than trading Mack, the Bears could try to unload another player or two in the coming days. </p>
<p> Going into this first offseason, Poles had only five draft picks this year. Mack’s trade gave him an additional second rounder and then a sixth rounder in 2023. Still, the Bears sit with just six draft picks in 2022 and Poles is going to need far more than that if he’s to make an impact on the future of this franchise. </p>
<p> The Bears have a couple of options to help acquire more draft capital, as well as unload future salary to set them up for a brighter 2023 and beyond. These three trades are some that Poles should definitely try to make come to fruition. </p>

<p> “Class players for a reason”: Australian star slams Finch criticism </p>
<p> Aaron Finch’s spot in the Australian team has come under fire. </p>
<p> It has been a somewhat bleak series for Australian T20 captain Aaron Finch with the bat against Sri Lanka, which finished with him being demoted down the order, however, wicket-keeper Matthew Wade has slammed talk that he should be replaced. </p>
<p> Finch's position in the team - despite his captaincy - has been under fire for some time. </p>
<p> A weak World Cup in the United Arab Emirates despite the team winning the tournament for the first time, as well as poor form back at home against Sri Lanka has major questions being asked over his ability to remain in the team. </p>
<p> It would appear unlikely he will be replaced as captain in a World Cup year, however, given his form, the possibility exists. </p>
<p> While Australia beat Sri Lanka 4-1 in the five-game series, Finch made scores of 8, 25, 35, 2 and 8 during the series, moving down the order in Game 3, 4, and 5. His 35 in Canberra came at worse than a run a ball and threatened to dig a hole for the home side. </p>
<p> Speaking to the media following Game 5 though, Wade said Finch is a class player and, in a similar fashion to David Warner who was majorly out of form before the World Cup where he ended as the second-highest run-scorer, should be kept in the team. </p>
<p> “It feels like these questions have come before, potentially before the last World Cup, and after the first couple of games about David,” Wade said after Australia’s thrilling five-wicket loss to Sri Lanka. </p>
<p> “Everyone had their say about Davey, and he got player of the tournament in the World Cup. </p>
<p> “Finchy is a class player and I’ve heard people questioning where he’s at. He averages 40 and strikes at 140 for a reason because he’s a class player, he’s the captain of our team. </p>
<p> “The questions are always going to come when you get a little bit older and you don’t do well in one series or not the next. </p>
<p> “But they’re class players for a reason and the best that we’ve had in T20 cricket ever and I don’t expect any change at the top of the order to be honest. </p>
<p> “Those two will be there in the World Cup, I’m confident in that and when the big game comes they’ll nail it.” </p>
<p> Australia's next short form assignment will be three ODIs and one T20 in Pakistan, which follow a three-Test series in what is the first tour to the sub-continent nation in 24 years. </p>
<p> Many of the Test players are expected to return home after the red-ball series, painting another challenge for Finch who could be captaining a vastly different team. </p>

<p> Coach Edwards Previews Spring Football </p>
<p> "There's a chemistry, I do believe, just being around these guys for the last two months, there's a different chemistry. It's just a different football team. You can feel it." Sun Devil Football Head Coach Herm Edwards had his first media availability of the Spring following his team's opening practice and provided an outlook on the team. Arizona State is using the Spring to break in a pair of new coordinators, assess the state of the quarterback competition, and acclimate more than two dozen new players that have joined the team. Coach Edwards feels that these changes have ushered in new energy and he's excited to see how things will develop moving forward. "I thought for the first day, with all the new guys practicing and trying to figure out which way to go especially on offense, it was a pretty competitive practice," said Edwards. "They had a lot of energy, which is good. It's kind of fun to watch the new guys that we have." Arizona State brought in several talented players as part of the 2022 Signing Class, adding high school prospects with high potential while also utilizing the Transfer Portal to immediately fill the needs of the team. "Twenty-six new players on the roster. That's kind of interesting when you start looking at the different position groups. And obviously the competition at a lot of the groups… QB1 being one. Obviously, that's one that you look at and go, okay, what are we going to do?" That's the million-dollar question for the Sun Devil football team this upcoming season. Who is going to be leading the offense? Coach Edwards isn't too stressed about the situation. For him, the answer is clear, whoever proves that they can take care of the ball and move the offense down the field will be the one at the helm. "I got five quarterbacks and I have to figure out who the guy is. So that's where that is at," said Edwards when asked about the quarterback competition. "For the quarterback, it's who can run the offense? How do you move the offense?" Paul Tyson, Trenton Bourget, Finn Collins, Daylin McLemore, and Bennett Meredith have all been competing for reps, pushing each other to be better not only on the field, but in the film room learning the new offense. Although the system has changed under offensive coordinator Glenn Thomas, the key philosophies have not wavered. "One key is to not turn the ball over. That was a little bit of our Achilles heel last year. We turned the ball over, along with fouls. We got to get that corrected. It's going to be fun to watch. We got some guys with some talent. So we will just let it play it out and see where its at." As for the rest of the offense, Edwards feels that there is plenty of competition. There are a lot of young players on the roster that are looking to make a name for themselves. This includes the offensive line, who is replacing three starters from last season. Isaia Glass and Spencer Lovell have emerged as starting candidates, while Penn State transfer Des Holmes has impressed coaches with his physicality. The versatility and flexibility of Ben Scott allow everything to come together, as he makes the move from right tackle to center. The anchor of the whole unit remains LaDarius Henderson, who has made his way onto draft boards after a dominant 2021 campaign. After losing several impact players from the 2021 team, many of whom will hear their name called in the upcoming 2022 NFL Draft, there are multiple positions that need to be filled. One of those areas is at the skill positions, a point of emphasis in the offseason for the Sun Devils. "We have some young receivers that we think have potential. Ricky Pearsall is probably the guy that's been on the big stage the most. The tight ends, we have a good group. Probably the best group that we've had. (Curtis) Hodges had a great year for us last year and he will be hard to replace, but we have some physicality and size." said Edwards. As for the backfield, Edwards knows that replacing 2nd Team All-Pac 12 running back Rachaad White won't be easy. "The running back situation is interesting. There's some talent there. You lose Rachaad White, and as you know, he was a big part of our offense. He helped us out a lot in the run game and in the pass game. It is only the first day of practice, we will see where it goes. But it's fun to watch the guys compete, I do know that. They're a very competitive group." Those in the competition include returner Daniyel Ngata and two newcomers, Wyoming transfer Xazavian Valladay and true freshman Tevin White. Defensively, the Sun Devils are losing several key pieces from last year. Edwards noted that while there is experience at almost every defensive position, they are still looking to improve that side of the ball and the competition will be fierce throughout spring ball. "We feel like we have some young guys (defensively) that have some talent, so it will be fun to watch," said Edwards. Starting with the secondary, which is filled with capable bodies, with a pecking order still to be determined. The options are plentiful, as several defensive backs return after gaining valuable experience last season. Jordan Clark, Kejuan Markham, Keon Markham, Macen Williams, and Ed Woods are a few of the returners that have stepped up in the Spring. "Corners have played some. As you guys know, we play a lot of man-to-man. We put our corners under a lot of stress. We anticipate the two safeties coming in and battling for positions as well." Linebackers Eric Gentry, Will Shaffer, Caleb McCullough, and Connor Soelle continued their improvement from last season, competing for playing time. Under new Defensive Coordinator Donnie Henderson, the front seven will be counted on to establish the line of scrimmage and impact the quarterback. Luckily, Henderson will be well equipped with an arsenal of pass rushers, with the return of Travez Moore, Michael Matus, Joe Moore, Stanley Lambert, and Anthonie Cooper, as well as T.J. Pesefea and Omarr Norman-Lott on the inside. "The linebacker position, we got some veteran guys coming in, which is good. Defensive lineman, we brought in some new d-lineman, we're probably in the market cause we have some flexibility to still go out and get some players after spring ball." Despite the infusion of youth and fresh faces, it has been veterans on the defensive side of the ball have been setting the tone. Jermayne Lole, Merlin Robertson, and Kyle Soelle have provided valuable leadership and wisdom for the young front seven. In the secondary, Timarcus Davis has assumed a more vocal role, as ASU looks to replace several members of last year's back end. Much remains to be seen for Coach Edwards and his staff before the season kicks off in September, but Sun Devil fans have a lot to be excited about as it relates to the potential of the team. For now, the focus remains on the guys in the locker room and the energy that they are bringing to the table every day. Edwards is confident that the current players are going to be the ones that take the program to new heights. "You can see it. You can feel it. I see these guys on Saturdays working out (from my office). There hasn't been a Saturday where a group of guys has not been out on this turf, working out on their own. That's interesting. No coaches out there, because they can't be out there. They've done that for the last month and a half. It's interesting." Accountability and confidence have been two themes prevalent at practice so far, a sign of a renewed optimism and belief in the program. "We got the makings," said Edwards. "It's going to be fun to see it develop." Fans will have their first chance to check out the 2022 team when Sun Devil Football hosts its 2022 Spring Showcase presented by AAA Insurance on Saturday, April 9 at Sun Devil Stadium. Stadium gates will open at 6:00 p.m. MST and fans will get the chance to observe the 2022 Sun Devil Football roster for the first time beginning at 7 p.m. MST. Make sure to stay in Sun Devil Stadium until the conclusion of practice to watch the post-event fireworks overhead. </p>

<p> Colby Covington slams ‘fat pig’ Rosie O’Donnell and ‘broke b-tch’ 50 Cent </p>
<p> ‘Chaos’ has came out and mocked Rosie O’Donnell for her weight and 50 Cent for beating his “defenseless spouses.” </p>

<p> Colby Covington has put celebrities Rosie O’Donnell and 50 Cent on blast for bashing him after his loss to Kamaru Usman at UFC 245 last December. </p>
<p> Usman defended his welterweight title for the first time against Covington in the main event of UFC 245, stopping the former interim champ in the fifth round after a back and forth fight. The loss prompted many to talk down about the highly outspoken Covington, with those like O’Donnell and 50 Cent (Curtis Jackson) ultimately pleased ‘Chaos’ got what was coming to him. </p>
<p> Talking recently to MMA Fighting, Covington said it’s hard not to laugh when he says the likes of O’Donnell mocking him, but that didn’t stop him from replying to her comments. </p>
<p> “Rosie O’Donnell? What the f—k has Rosie O’Donnell ever done?” Covington said. “She’s losing 10-8 rounds to obesity. She’s losing 10-8 rounds to Donald Trump on f—king Twitter. Who is she to talk about Colby “Chaos” Covington? She’s never f—king fought. She hasn’t done s—t. </p>
<p> “The only thing she’s fighting for are all the women who are leaving her because they’re trying to come to me and they’re sweating me on Instagram. So f—k Rosie O’Donnell, that fat pig.” </p>
<p> Covington continued his tirade by then targeting Jackson, who labelled Covington as a “racist piece of s—t” before the fight and celebrated the fact he broke his jaw against Usman. He continued by saying he wants to fight Jackson in a boxing match next. </p>
<p> “I want to fight 50 Cent next. I think we should do a celebrity charity boxing match. I’ll put up $1 million of my dollars and it’s going to go straight to the troops. He’s a broke b—ch so he probably doesn’t have a million dollars but he can go as one of his f—king sponsors to put it up and we can do this.” </p>
<p> “I want one hand tied behind my back. I will let him pick which hand to tie behind me back. Left or right, whichever one you want, 50. Be a f—king man. You want to talk s—t about me on Instagram and you want to talk s—t out there? What did you ever beat, 50 Cent, besides your defenseless spouses in Hollywood.” </p>

<p> Coors Almighty Light is the beer to clutch while watching Studio 666 </p>
<p> As the Foo Fighters release their highly anticipated Studio 666 documentary which follows the creation of Medicine at Midnight, the band’s 10th studio album, there might be more than a haunting drum beat lingering in the air. Coors Almighty Light is ready to ward off any supernatural threats. </p>
<p> For those unfamiliar, Studio 666 shows Dave Grohl becoming possessed during the album’s creation. As seen in this clip, the situation could have many people grabbing a beer to calm their nerves. </p>
<p> While the film might seem that a lot goes into making a killer album, there seems to be a good story woven into that perfect note. Although this theme might have been played out in many ways over the years, some musicians may want to sell their soul in order to achieve that iconic song. </p>
<p> As part of the hype regarding the new Studio 666 and upcoming Medicine at Midnight, Coors Light wants to join the conversation. While some Foo Fighter super fans might know this beverage fact, but Coors Light is Dave Grohl’s favorite beer. </p>
<p> Once Grohl told KLOS-FM that Coors Light is part of his pre-show ritual. While that beer might help calm the nerves before taking the stage, that perfect shot of refreshment it is part of the ritual. </p>
<p> With the Coors Almighty Light, the favorite beer brand looks to be that silver bullet to pair with the Medicine at Midnight. While the limited edition beer is “made with Rocky Mountain Water that has been blessed by a spiritual guru,” it might be a good omen for many beer drinkers. Although there are no promises in the can, it might be better to be safe than sorry. </p>
<p> More information on this special offering and how to obtain the spiritually enlightened beer will be available via the Coors website. </p>

<p> Cricket Australia detail Langer succession plan with potential “way of the future” coaching shake up </p>
<p> CA’s new chair has stated he is “open” to a more dynamic coaching structure in the near future. </p>
<p> Newly appointed Cricket Australia chair Lachlan Henderson has revealed he is "open" to the idea of splitting the senior coaching duties as CA plan their next era in the wake of Justin Langer's resignation. </p>
<p> Henderson has flagged that the process to find Langer's successor won't be "drawn-out", despite Australia's first red-ball series less than two weeks away. </p>
<p> Assistant Andrew McDonald has taken on interim duties since Langer's departure, with the former Victorian all-rounder understood to be the leading candidate for the top job. </p>
<p> However, McDonald has been vocal in suggesting CA split coaches across Test and One-Day formats, something Henderson is set to ponder in the coming months. </p>
<p> For now though, Cricket Australia are set to appoint a sole successor while keeping a more dynamic coaching approach in mind for the future. </p>
<p> “I’m open to advice on that,” Henderson told ABC Radio on splitting coaches across multiple formats. </p>
<p> “I think it is a very time-consuming role for one individual and maybe a more distributed method of coaching is the way of the future. </p>
<p> “They’re the sort of things that are playing out at the moment. We are going for a single head coach to be installed in the near future. How it plays out after that will depend a bit on that appointment, their availability and how that works across all forms of the game in what’s going to be a really busy 12 to 18 months. </p>
<p> “It may be that person is not available for every single tour around the world over the next 18 months.” </p>
<p> McDonald will be joined by former England coach Trevor Bayliss as a potential replacement for Langer, while Greg Shipperd and Michael Di Venuto could also be considered. </p>
<p> With Australia set to tour Pakistan early next month, an appointment will be looming for Cricket Australia, with Henderson stating the process won't be on hold for too long. </p>
<p> “It’s not going to be a long and drawn-out process and obviously we’ve got an interim coach already installed,” Henderson said. </p>
<p> Australia and Pakistan will begin their three-Test series on March 4 at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium. </p>

<p> Cricket news 2022: Ashton Agar subject of death threat, Pakistan vs Australia Test </p>
<p> Cricket Australia has investigated a death threat reportedly sent to the partner of spinner Ashton Agar, who arrived in Pakistan this week. </p>
<p> Cricket Australia has investigated a death threat reportedly sent to the partner of spin bowler Ashton Agar ahead of Australia’s historic tour of Pakistan. </p>
<p> As first revealed by The Sydney Morning Herald, a message was sent to Agar’s partner on social media warning that the cricketer should not travel to Pakistan. The message was immediately reported to CA and the Pakistan Cricket Board. </p>
<p> Watch Australia’s Tour of Pakistan on Kayo. Every Test, ODI and T20 Live & On-Demand. New to Kayo? Start your free trial now > </p>
<p> Screenshots of the alleged death threat have circulated social media, a portion of which read: “This is an warning for your husband Ashton Agar. If he comes for tour against Pakistan he won’t come alive. </p>
<p> “Your children will miss there father if he comes to Pakistan.” </p>
<p> It is believed the message was sent from a fake Instagram account, potentially based in India. </p>
<p> On Monday evening, a Cricket Australia spokesperson confirmed the organisation was aware of the social media post, which the PCB and government security agencies had also investigated. </p>
<p> “There are extensive security plans in place for this type of social media activity, which, in this case, is not considered a risk,” the statement read. </p>
<p> “No further comment will be made at this time.” </p>
<p> Due to safety concerns, the Australian men’s cricket team had not toured Pakistan since 1998, when former Test captain Mark Taylor famously scored an unbeaten 334 in Peshawar. </p>
<p> Pakistan has been forced to host international matches in the United Arab Emirates since the tragic 2009 Lahore attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team. </p>
<p> The Australian Test squad landed in Pakistan on Sunday, with training scheduled to commence at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Tuesday. </p>
<p> Islamabad-born batter Usman Khawaja said the players had not faced any issues since touching down in the Asian nation. </p>
<p> “It’s not too dissimilar to the other subcontinental tours we’ve toured,” he told reporters on Monday. </p>
<p> “Even when we went to India or Bangladesh, we weren’t really allowed outside of the hotel room much anyway, other than training and playing games. </p>
<p> “It’s pretty similar, I think. </p>
<p> “Obviously there’s a lot of security around us but they hide pretty well in plain sight. </p>
<p> “They’re doing a pretty good job at being around but not being seen.” </p>
<p> On Sunday, Australian Test captain Pat Cummins praised CA and the PCB for the security measures that ensured the tour would be a success. </p>
<p> “We’re really lucky to be surrounded by so many professionals,” he told reporters. </p>
<p> “That was one of the big factors that we wanted to be thorough on before arriving here: not only security but biosecurity. Everyone’s done a fantastic job. </p>
<p> “We feel like we’re here and we can just focus on the cricket.” </p>
<p> Australia’s first Test match against Pakistan gets underway at Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Friday, with the first ball scheduled for 4pm AEDT. </p>

<p> Cricket news, England cricket legend Ted Dexter dies aged 86 </p>
<p> England cricket great Ted Dexter has died aged 86. </p>
<p> The famously nonchalant personality captained the Sussex and England cricket teams throughout the 1960s. </p>
<p> Born in Italy, Dexter’s family migrated to England shortly before the second world war broke out. He would go on to study at Cambridge where he earned his Blues in cricket. </p>
<p> He soon formed into an aggressive middle-order batsman that famously hit 481 runs during the 1962-1963 tour of Australia and New Zealand – the most by an England captain in Australia to this day. </p>
<p> He retired from cricket in 1968 and went on to write books about golfing techniques. </p>
<p> He died in the Compton Hospice in Wolverhampton, surrounded by his family, Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) said. </p>
<p> “Ted was a cherished husband, father and grandfather and one of England’s greatest ever cricketers,” the MCC said. </p>
<p> “He was captain in 30 of his 62 Test matches and played the game with the same sense of adventure and fun that captures much of the story of his remarkable life.” </p>
<p> In June this year, he was inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame. </p>

<p> Tim Tszyu wins American boxing debut as Aussie dominates Terrell Gausha in 12-round epic </p>

<p> live feed </p>
<p> Tim Tszyu has revealed he was "coughing like a dog" in the days leading up to his stunning American debut victory over Terrell Gausha. </p>
<p> Tszyu dominated his opponent over 12 brutal rounds to win by unanimous decision in what was his first foray into fighting outside Australia. </p>
<p> While the judges were unanimous in their verdict, there was some suspect cards entered after Tszyu clearly beat Gausha into submission in the final few rounds. </p>
<p> The cards read 114-113, 116-111, 115-112 in favour of the Aussie, but how one of them only gave him victory by one round is a mystery - although fighting an American in the US, it's no surprise. </p>
<p> After the win, Tszyu revealed he had been ill leading up to the bout. </p>
<p> Experts had questioned how he looked out of energy when stepping onto the scales at the weigh-in. </p>
<p> "I had one hell of a prep, man. Two days before the fight I was coughing like a dog," Tszyu told Main Event. </p>
<p> "Weight was a problem as well, but I stuck through, got back up, faced adversity in training camp, in the fight, and I got the job done against a world-rated opponent. </p>
<p> "It was horrible. I couldn't breathe. Even now, it's still in my lungs. </p>
<p> "For the two weeks I was here in America it was hard work. But I was trying to drink water, trying to not show it to anyone, </p>
<p> "I didn't want media finding out and having excuses and s--t like that." </p>
<p> Tszyu was knocked down in the opening round by a brutal Gausha right hand, and it looked like the Aussie was going to be out of his American debut quicksmart. </p>
<p> But he rallied, knocked down Gausha a couple of rounds later, and then dominated the late rounds with some heavy body shots that his opponent will be feeling for weeks to come. </p>
<p> "Oh man, there were some s--t thoughts going through your head," he said of the knockdown. </p>
<p> "But it's not how hard you fall, it's how you can fall and get back up. </p>
<p> "Everything is quick. You sort of blink and then you're down and you go 'f--k how did that happen?'. </p>
<p> Aussie boxer Tim Tszyu has won his American debut. </p>
<p> Having won the first 20 fights of his professional career, Tszyu travelled to the US to take on hometown fighter Terrell Gausha. </p>
<p> It was a brutal 12 rounds where both boxers were knocked down once. </p>
<p> But the judges correctly awarded the fight to the Aussie on unanimous decision 114-113, 116-111, 115-112. </p>
<p> Gausha is in a world of pain, those Tszyu body shots are ridiculous. </p>
<p> The final minute is brutal - the American stays on his feet somehow. </p>
<p> We are going to the judges! They hug - Tszyu dominated. Let's hope the cards are correct. </p>
<p> Tszyu strong to start the round with some big body shots. </p>
<p> Gausha struggling now and his guard drops after those body shots. </p>
<p> Gausha is not throwing those big shots anymore, he looks spent, just trying to make it to the bell. </p>
<p> Body shots from Tszyu - that would bloody hurt.v The American is in pain now. </p>
<p> Tszyu has recovered so well from that first round knockdown. </p>
<p> Tszyu trying to open the guard of Gausha buit it's a tough assignment. </p>
<p> The American gets a couple of nice jabs through and hits Tszyu. </p>
<p> The Aussies throwing some big hooks and rocks the American. </p>
<p> Tszyu lands a big shot to the body and his opponent is rocked, but stands there and takes punishment to finish the round. </p>
<p> Again Tszyu working the body and Gausha throwing some big right hands. </p>
<p> Just as Tszyu appears to be on top, Gausha lands a huge right and rocks the Aussie. </p>
<p> Tszyu shows his power and punches through the guard, but the American doesn't seem to be too rocked. </p>
<p> Gausha comes out firing with that right hand and he lands one on Tszyu, but the Aussie shakes it off. </p>
<p> Tszyu goes low to the body but it doesn't seem to worry his opponent. </p>
<p> Gausha sitting back and waiting for the chance to throw a big right now. He seems to know he needs a knockout. </p>
<p> Tszyu is the busier fighter. He has Gausha on the ropes again and works the body. </p>
<p> Gausha rocks Tszyu with three big shots to the head. </p>
<p> "He wanted a war, he's got one," says Ben Damon on Main Event. </p>
<p> Huge shots in the last minute of that round, this is a brutal fight. </p>
<p> Gausha lands one and Ben Damon says Tszyu "has got to be aware of that right hand". </p>
<p> Tszyu pushes his opponent to the ropes and goes to work. </p>
<p> The American fights out of it with a big right hand. </p>
<p> Gausha has done well to make it this far, but one big punch could also be disastrous for Tszyu. </p>

<p> Pakistan star Shaheen Shah Afridi's hostile welcoming for Steve Smith in third Test </p>
<p> Australia was rocked after choosing to bat first in Lahore, losing both David Warner and Marnus Labuschagne before the score reached double figures, after a scintillating spell from Pakistan paceman Shaheen Shah Afridi. </p>
<p> After removing two of Australia's big guns, Afridi set his sights on Steve Smith as Smith strode to the wicket following Labuschagne's dismissal. </p>
<p> Afridi met Smith before the Australian star could even reach the pitch, offering some words of advice to the vice-captain, who shook his head in response and kept walking. </p>
<p> "I just wonder, the guys are staying in the same hotel, maybe he just asked, 'what did you have for breakfast?'," former Australian paceman Michael Kasprowicz joked on commentary. </p>
<p> "He had a bit of a chat to Labuschagne also as he came in," lead commentator Mike Heysman added. </p>
<p> "They've gotten to know each other pretty well, these players. They've been travelling together to practices, practicising at the same time." </p>
<p> While the entire Test series has been played in good spirits, there have been a number of tense moments, namely Naseem Shah's attempt to intimidate David Warner in the first Test. </p>
<p> Warner trapped cheaply by Pakistan quick </p>
<p> Shah, who made his Test debut against Australia at just 16 years of age in 2019, attempted to stare down Warner after hitting him on the body with a short-pitched delivery, only for Warner to laugh in response. </p>
<p> The 19-year-old was recalled into Pakistan's line-up for the third Test after being omitted for the second Test. </p>
<p> The three-match series is currently tied 0-0 after Pakistan fought hard from a monster first-innings deficit to draw the second Test last week. </p>

<p> David expressed his excitement in linking up with Lancashire for the upcoming T20 Blast season. </p>
<p> “I am really excited that this opportunity has come about, and I can’t wait to join up with the rest of the Lancashire Lightning squad for the start of the Vitality Blast in May," David said, per the club's announcement. </p>
<p> “There is such a strong squad at Emirates Old Trafford and hopefully I can contribute with the bat and the ball to help the team go well this summer. </p>
<p> “I thoroughly enjoyed my brief spell with Surrey and the Brave in England last year and I am looking forward to building on that experience with the Red Rose.” </p>
<p> David brings plenty of international experience to the Lightining, having featured in 14 International T20 matches with Singapore while also having forged stints with the IPL side the Royal Challengers Bangalore and Lahore Qalandars and the Multan Sultans in Pakistan. </p>
<p> Lancashire head coach Glen Chapple as delighted with locking in David's signature. </p>
<p> "Tim fits the profile of player which we have been looking to bring into our T20 squad and his addition will give us more power in the middle order," Lancashire Chapple said. </p>
<p> "His impressive T20 record - both at international level and in various leagues around the world - speaks for itself and we are really looking forward to him joining us in May." </p>
<p> The Lightning, who are home to English stars James Anderson and Jos Buttler, will begin their 2022 campaign against Sussex on May, 28 at the Bristol County Ground. </p>

<p> EXCLUSIVE: Barry Hall questions Sonny Bill Williams' 'suspect chin' ahead of heavyweight Turf War fight </p>
<p> Barry Hall respects Sonny Bill Williams as an athlete, as a man and is extremely wary of his punching power and quality jab. </p>
<p> But the AFL champion has identified what he believes is a glaring weakness as they prepare to trade blows at Sydney's Aware Super Theatre tonight. </p>
<p> "I think he's got power – I think his chin is something that's suspect," Hall told Wide World of Sports ahead of his second fight as a professional. </p>
<p> TURF WAR: Sonny Bill Williams vs Barry Hall, live and exclusive on Stan Event, March 23. Purchase the event now at stan.com.au/event </p>
<p> "So that's why I've been working on power so much – I just need one shot. I'll be patient because I just need one shot. </p>
<p> "He's hopped up before and fought on, I realise that, but we need to touch him." </p>
<p> Hall is a former Victorian junior champion and his only pro fight was a controversial 2019 draw against Paul Gallen. </p>
<p> Hall teams up with UFC star </p>
<p> He is confident in his own chin after being "put through the wringer" by hungry sparring partners. </p>
<p> "They say in the boxing game, you train hard and fight easy and that's what happens. You've got fresh guys coming in each round and they put it on you because unfortunately you're a name and they want that scalp, even if it's sparring," he said. </p>
<p> "It's just how it is." </p>
<p> SBW claps back at Hall camp </p>
<p> Hall also admitted he was far more nervous about the fight than he was before a big AFL final at the MCG. </p>
<p> "It's way different. Footy, I knew I was good at it and you do it every week," Hall said. </p>
<p> "Depending on how you're feeling going in, you're not nervous because you know you're at a certain level. Boxing, I've had one fight and there's still the unknown and you don't do it every week. </p>
<p> "So it's pretty hard to get used to. So a little bit more anxious doing this but that's fine, that's good, I'm excited about it." </p>

<p> McLaren fear F1 struggles will take a long time to resolve </p>
<p> McLaren's discouraging run at the Bahrain Grand Prix is set to continue as the team accepts it is "a long way off" where it needs to be at the start of the 2022 Formula 1 season. </p>
<p> There were high hopes for McLaren after it topped the first day of the Barcelona pre-season shakedown, but after a dismal showing at Bahrain testing and underperformance in the season opener, the new MCL36 is proving to be a handful. </p>
<p> A clear lack of competitiveness at the Bahrain GP saw Aussie Daniel Ricciardo manage 14th position, while his teammate in the papaya, Lando Norris finished behind him in 15th. </p>
<p> Speaking after the race, team principal Andreas Seidl said, "we know we have an issue on the performance side, which is disappointing and painful". </p>
<p> "It definitely looks like this track here has exposed us to the weaknesses our package is having quite a lot." </p>
<p> Unfortunately for McLaren fans, it doesn't appear the team's problems are a quick fix. </p>
<p> "I'm expecting pain and I think everyone needs to know there's going to be a bit of pain," Norris said. </p>
<p> It's a far cry from where McLaren has levelled itself in the past five years, securing its first race win since 2012 at Monza last season and working to position itself at the front of F1's midfield. </p>
<p> "It's just where we are, quite simply," Norris said. </p>
<p> "We just have to get a little bit used to it now. </p>
<p> "Of course over the last few seasons there's a lot of expectation from us within the team but also from everyone else watching and so on, and we just haven't got it right at the minute. </p>
<p> "We're a long, long way off. Not just a little bit, we're a long way [off]. </p>
<p> "So we've got to start afresh and figure some things out, find solutions. </p>
<p> "Solutions don't mean next week we're gonna be amazing, but in the months to come we need to understand what's going on and how to get better." </p>
<p> Teammate Ricciardo hopes the new-generation car has a good base and it is only a matter of mitigating a few teething issues. </p>
<p> "If we just find the numbers that will translate into a decent car but obviously for now we just don't have the same numbers as the front teams," he said. </p>
<p> "What still fills me with some optimism is it's completely new cars obviously for everyone this year. </p>
<p> "Some teams have found a really good chunk. Maybe it's just we keep trying a few things with set-up and we're like, 'oh, that turned the car on'. </p>
<p> "We're still optimistic we might find something even in set-up, maybe not even in an update, so let's stay hopeful for that." </p>
<p> Norris said he hopes this is "as bad as it gets" but if not he has backed his team to find a solution by the end of the record-breaking, 23-race season. </p>
<p> "We've still got a whole season of development and figuring things out but it's just not easy to do so," he said. </p>
<p> "Once we figure out what's going on and what's wrong then it's all about implementing it and bringing upgrades and bringing those parts to the car. </p>
<p> "Figuring out is the hard part. Putting things in the wind tunnel, all that kind of stuff. But it could come a third of the way through the season, halfway through the season, three quarters. </p>
<p> "I don't want to believe it's not going to be at all this season. I have faith in the team that they'll be able to do it. </p>
<p> "They've done it the past few years. We just need to step back and re-look at everything and go again." </p>
<p> McLaren will get another chance to gauge their plight with first practice for the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix kicking off on Friday night. </p>

<p> Decisive Lions Test overshadowed by unsporting behaviour and ugly rugby </p>
<p> Warren Gatland must make changes before Saturday, not least because the sport needs a better spectacle than first two Tests </p>
<p> To say there are mixed emotions swirling around the final week of this British & Irish Lions Test tour is an understatement. In theory everyone should be caught up in the delicious prospect of a winner-takes-all final Test against the reigning world champions. In practice this series is now testing everyone’s stamina, both on the field and in living rooms around the world. </p>
<p> If the “Timeless Test” on Saturday – a match which contained more stop-start inaction than a broken video recorder – becomes the norm then international rugby may as well pack up its tattered kitbag now. It was a shame, in some ways, that South Africa’s curfew regulations have eased this week. Had they switched the floodlights off with 20 minutes left and sent everyone home early there would certainly have been no complaints from the Lions. </p>
<p> Joking aside, the touring team’s prolonged second-half agony has prompted any number of uncomfortable questions for the sport’s administrators as well as the Lions’ head coach, Warren Gatland. If a Lions series is to remain the pinnacle of the game it urgently needs the third Test to deliver more entertainment than two teams kicking the ball skywards and seeing who can keep the citing officer busiest. Niggly, sour, unattractive … and that was just last week’s buildup. </p>
<p> Increasingly, such concerns go well beyond one harassed referee or an unsporting coach or a few dropped high balls. When a half of Test rugby lasts 63 minutes because the match officials are either consulting the television match official, lecturing the players or attempting to stop them snarling at each other, it really does feel as if the tail is wagging the dog. </p>
<p> While not every game can be like the Premiership final this year, interest in future Lions series will wane appreciably if this remains the default setting. When even someone such as Jonathan Davies, the great former Wales fly-half, calls it “a dreadful spectacle” and urges World Rugby to consider law changes to mitigate the box kicking, endless aerial bombardments and suffocating line speed, only a sadist would disagree. </p>
<p> This is not to decry the dominance of the Springbok forwards late on, nor the well-executed tries from Makazole Mapimpi and Lukhanyo Am which helped the hosts to win the second half 21-0. Their defence also continues to be formidable: in Munster they regard Jacques Nienaber as a defensive genius and this South African squad has now conceded just three tries in their past nine Tests. Then again, when a Lions side representing the cream of British & Irish back-play performs as unimaginatively as they did on Saturday, almost anyone would fancy keeping their line intact without too much bother. </p>
<p> Which is why Gatland, having had the Boks exactly where he wanted them, surely needs to pursue a different tack this Saturday. With the now Covid-free Springboks visibly better for having had more preparation time together, simply waiting until 60 minutes for their big forwards to blow up is not going be enough. The Lions need to create more, as well as finding other ways to circumvent South Africa’s power game, to avoid becoming only the third Lions side in history to surrender a series after winning the first Test. </p>
<p> Certain changes would appear obvious. Win or lose last weekend, the Lions were always likely to require some fresh bodies and, fitness permitting, the Welsh trio of Liam Williams, Josh Adams and Wyn Jones all appear obvious starting candidates. Enforced citing-related alterations aside, there is also an argument for more ball-carrying dynamism and breakdown presence than has been evident in the first two Tests. </p>
<p> If, say, Bundee Aki starts at inside centre with his Ireland colleague Robbie Henshaw sliding out to No 13, could that open the door for someone such as Finn Russell to try to paint a few different pictures at No 10? During the Lions’ warmup on Saturday it was instructive to watch Russell’s dexterity and slick distribution, so much so that Gatland surely has to have the Racing 92 fly-half in the 23. </p>
<p> Do that and reinstating his Scotland teammate Ali Price at No 9 makes sense, as might the bench inclusion of Sam Simmonds whose pace would offer an alternative threat. Even switching Maro Itoje to the blindside and introducing another fresh specialist lock might be worth considering if the Lions really do want to roar back and surprise opponents who were regaining their old swagger in the final quarter. </p>
<p> None of that, though, will amount to a hill of kidney beans if the Lions cannot also retain their discipline. To many observers South Africa were lucky to finish with 15 players on the field but, equally, the Lions allowed their frustration to get the better of them. Whoever starts this Saturday it will not be mentally easy to reboot after so many weeks cooped up in their biosecure bubble and without any travelling fans to re-energise them in their darkest moments. </p>
<p> In that respect, at least, there remains some tension as the endgame beckons. In the recent past, third Tests have delivered big time: the controversial 2017 thriller in Auckland, the Wallaby trouncing in Sydney in 2013, the runaway Lions win at Ellis Park in 2009. Maybe by next Saturday night some of the more gloomy verdicts on rugby’s demise will have proved slightly premature. </p>
<p> For that to happen, though, it surely requires World Rugby to clear the air on the subject of Rassie Erasmus’s recent behaviour and to remind all concerned that the integrity of the game is more important than churlish short-term mind games. It will matter not whether the Lions or the Boks win this series if their global audience sighs with relief when it all ends or derives more fun from watching red or green paint dry. </p>

<p> RSS Feed (Really Simple Syndication) </p>
<p> In a world heaving under the weight of billions of web pages, keeping up to date with the information you want can be a drag. </p>
<p> Wouldn't it be better to have the latest news and features delivered directly to you, rather than clicking from site to site? </p>
<p> Using RSS (Really Simple Syndication) allows you to see when sites from all over the internet have added new content. You can get the latest headlines and articles (or even audio files, photographs or video) in one place, as soon as they are published, without having to remember to visit each site every day. </p>
<p> RSS takes the hassle out of staying up-to-date, by showing you the very latest information that you are interested in. </p>
<p> RSS feeds are just a special kind of web page, designed to be read by computers rather than people. It might help to think of them as the free, internet version of the old-fashioned ticker-tape news wire machines. </p>
<p> Not all websites currently provide RSS, but it is growing rapidly in popularity and many others, including the Guardian, New York Times and CNN provide it. </p>
<p> In general, the first thing you need is something called a news reader. This is a piece of software that checks RSS feeds and lets you read any new articles that have been added to them. There are many different versions, some of which are accessed using a browser, and some of which are downloadable applications. Browser-based news readers let you catch up with your RSS feed subscriptions from any computer, whereas downloadable applications let you store them on your main computer, in the same way that you either download your e-mail using Outlook, or keep it on a web-based service like Hotmail. </p>
<p> Once you have chosen a news reader, all you have to do is to decide what content you want to receive in your news reader, by finding and subscribing to the relevant RSS feeds. For example, if you would like the latest BBC Sport Football stories, simply visit the Football section and you will notice an orange RSS button on the left hand side. </p>
<p> If you click on the button you can subscribe to the feed in various ways, including by dragging the URL of the RSS feed into your news reader or by cutting and pasting the same URL into a new feed in your news reader. </p>
<p> You can subscribe to feeds of our best video and audio content in the same way and will find a selection available in our Video and Audio index. </p>
<p> Most sites that offer RSS feeds use a similar orange RSS button, but some may just have a normal web link to the feed. </p>
<p> Some browsers, including Firefox, Opera and Safari, automatically check for RSS feeds for you when you visit a website, and display an icon when they find one. This can make subscribing to RSS feeds much easier. For more details on these, please check their websites. </p>
<p> The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites </p>
<p> How do I get a news reader? </p>
<p> There is a range of different news readers available and new versions are appearing all the time. </p>
<p> Different news readers work on different operating systems, so you will need to choose one that will work with your computer. </p>
<p> If you run your own website, you can use RSS feeds to display the latest headlines from other sites on your site. </p>
<p> We encourage the use of BBC Sport RSS feeds as part of a website, subject to our Terms of Use. </p>
<p> However, we do require that the proper format and attribution is used when BBC Sport content appears. The attribution text should read "BBC Sport" or "From BBC Sport" as appropriate. You may not use any BBC logo or other BBC trademark. </p>
<p> We reserve the right to prevent the distribution of BBC Sport content. Please read our Terms of Use for further instructions. </p>
<p> The BBC does not accept any liability for its RSS feeds. Please see the Terms of Use for full details. </p>
<p> There are also various other feeds from other BBC websites. You can subscribe to these in exactly the same described above. They may also be used on your website, subject to our Terms of Use. </p>
<p> And don't just be guided by the feeds we offer through our many indexes - you can create your own specific RSS feed by entering a specific term in our search engine. </p>
<p> If you want to know everything we publish from the world of Wayne Rooney, simply enter the search term "Wayne Rooney" then click on the News and Sport results tab and follow the RSS link which appears at the top of the search results list. </p>

<p> DGC golf: Ajeetesh Sandhu trails Nitithorn Thippong by two shots </p>
<p> If one goes by pedigree and past record, Gaganjeet Bhullar (fourth at four-under) has to fancy his chances. Nine wins on the Asian Tour (the most by an Indian) and local knowledge should count for something. </p>
<p> Ajeetesh Sandhu had never led an Asian Tour event before coming to Delhi (Source: The DGC Open/Twitter) </p>
<p> As expected at the Delhi Golf Club, the first couple of pages of the leaderboard were inundated with Indian names. But all of them were chasing an unheralded Thai going into the final round of the DGC Open. </p>
<p> Coming into the event, not many would have heard of Nitithorn Thippong, and with good reason. The 25-year-old had never led an Asian Tour event before coming to Delhi, but a two-under par 70 on Saturday took the golfer from Bangkok to an eight-under aggregate and a two-shot lead over India’s Ajeetesh Sandhu at the Lodhi Course. </p>
<p> Not that Thippong was the only one from his country in contention. Settee Prakongvech’s 70 was enough to put him in sole possession of third spot, a further shot back, on a day when dropped shots were more frequent than birdies and eagles with only 11 players breaking par. </p>
<p> If one goes by pedigree and past record, Gaganjeet Bhullar (fourth at four-under) has to fancy his chances. Nine wins on the Asian Tour (the most by an Indian) and local knowledge should count for something. </p>
<p> Thippong didn’t have everything going his way, and had to grind out a decent round. “I just focus on my process, just play, and have fun. I didn’t hit many greens today, but I made a lot of great up and downs, I think I made almost all my up and downs,” he reflected. </p>
<p> Sandhu went backwards in relation to par with a round of one-over 73, and it was an eagle at the par-five 14th hole that gave him the chance to be in the final group, sandwiched between the two Thais. </p>
<p> The winner of the 2017 Yeangder Tournament Players Championship fought through the day to stay in the running. </p>
<p> “A difficult day. The wind was off, the course was firm. It was a very good test out there today,” the 33-year-old from Chandigarh said. “I hung in there today, didn’t really have my best day. Off the tee, with the irons, and with the putter, everything was kind of average. But I’m glad I’m still up there and I’ll have a shot to win tomorrow, so that means a lot.” </p>
<p> 🇮🇳’s hero of the day Ajeetesh Sandhu takes us through his wondrous performance in the third round today. </p>
<p> Veer Ahlawat, the leader at the halfway mark, had a disappointing day with a 78, but only five shots behind Thippong. </p>
<p> Bhullar was in an upbeat mood after finishing his third round with a birdie. “The last four to five holes were playing really tough and the moment you missed the green there, making an up and down was not easy. I’m glad I finished the round with a birdie on the 18th,” he said. “On such days, it’s very important to gauge the conditions early on in the round. I’ve played in worse conditions in Europe so I used that experience today. I kept telling myself that no one is going to hit low scores, so just keep making fairways and greens and keep making the up-and- downs.” Prakongvech was one of the rare players to break par on the day. A round of two-under 70 may not seem eye-catching on low-scoring days, but on Saturday it was enough for him to jump right into contention. </p>
<p> “The wind was very strong today and it was always changing, it was difficult,” he said. “In my starting holes, I hit very good tee shots, good second shots, good putts, so everything came together. But in the middle, I missed some key shots, some holes I missed and chipped out. The greens were a bit faster today and a bit hard. And also, the pin positions were difficult. I didn’t expect too much today, but no one played well.” </p>
<p> At an aggregate of one-over, SSP Chawrasia may seem out of the reckoning but the Kolkata pro made the best of the tough conditions in a round of three-under 69.“I was actually at 4-under but bogeyed my last hole. But anyway, three-under is a good round today. It was very windy today and it was playing really tough. The redesigned greens are playing the toughest. They put up a very tough setup. Not easily accessible,” Chawrasia said. </p>

<p> Dodgy selections, sexual harassment FIR and Bihar cricket rot </p>
<p> BCA president Rakesh Tiwary, a former state BJP treasurer, is at the centre of allegations of procedural wrongdoing and interference in the selection of teams. </p>
<p> Written by Ashish Satyam | Patna | Updated: March 30, 2022 9:22:27 am </p>
<p> The season that started with two under-19 teams entering BCCI's age-group tournament, both claiming to represent the divided Bihar Cricket Association(BCA), has been marked by constant chopping and changing. </p>
<p> This month, Bihar made eight changes to the playing XI for their final Ranji Trophy game against Arunachal Pradesh. They still ended the season without a win, finishing behind BCCI’s newer teams Nagaland, Manipur, Sikkim and Arunachal. </p>
<p> Here’s one obvious reason. The season that started with two under-19 teams entering BCCI’s age-group tournament, both claiming to represent the divided Bihar Cricket Association(BCA), has been marked by constant chopping and changing. The game of musical chairs, where 62 cricketers represented Bihar across tournaments, also saw three coaches and a selector being changed within months. There are other reasons that are not so obvious. </p>
<p> BCA president Rakesh Tiwary, a former state BJP treasurer, is at the centre of allegations of procedural wrongdoing and interference in the selection of teams. Tiwary was also named in a sexual harassment FIR filed at the Parliament Street police station in Delhi by an owner of a player management firm. </p>
<p> The charges levelled against Tiwary by his colleagues include holding key selection meetings at his home. Officials and coaches say those who didn’t toe Tiwary’s line were shown the door. </p>
<p> Former Bihar first-class player and coach Tarun Kumar says he put his foot down when Tiwary tried to influence the selection process. “There would be frequent requests to accommodate relatives of bureaucrats, politicians, businessmen. Such requests would regularly be from Tiwary. As I didn’t agree, I was sacked. Some of the players for the Syed Mushtaq Ali trophy were not even fit for club cricket,” Kumar said. </p>
<p> When contacted, Tiwary said the background of players was not a criteria but cricketing merit was. “We won’t play sons of bureaucrats and other such influential people just because their fathers are at an advantageous position,” Tiwary told The Indian Express. </p>
<p> Nikhilesh Ranjan, a Bihar batsman from the 1990s, replaced Kumar for the 50-over tournament, the Vijay Hazare Trophy. After the first two matches, Ranjan was demoted to assistant coach before being sacked. </p>
<p> “In the third match, Pavan Kumar, my assistant, was made the head coach and I was made his assistant. About 30 minutes into the fourth match, the manager called me while I was at the ground. He asked me to go back to the hotel, pack up and leave. Since there is no secretary or joint secretary, the president is in charge,” Ranjan said. </p>
<p> “In the recently concluded season, two reserve selectors were appointed apart from the three main selectors…this means the BCA was already aware that one of the three main selectors appointed would probably leave in between,” he said. </p>
<p> According to Tiwary, the change in back room personnel was necessitated because the coach was causing rifts in the team. </p>
<p> “In the Vijay Hazare Trophy, of the two coaches sent… there was a tussle between some of the players and we found that a coach was involved in incitement. The Ranji Trophy coach was found guilty in a very old case by the court of the Ethics Officer. However, we still appointed him. Later, someone filed a petition in the court of the Ethics Officer and the court held that once it has deemed someone guilty, how can he be appointed coach once again,” Tiwary said. </p>
<p> What has also raised eyebrows is the high number of players and standbys that represented Bihar this season. While this season’s Covid protocol allowed teams to name a 20-member squad for the Vijay Hazare Trophy, Bihar picked 25, including two reserves. Of them, 23 made it to the Playing XI, including the two reserves. Typically three or four players are named as stand-by teams, but Bihar had 15 for the Vijay Hazare tournament and Ranji Trophy. </p>
<p> Since the start of the domestic season in September last year, 62 senior cricketers have made it to the playing XI of Bihar across formats. The corresponding numbers in established teams, like Mumbai and Karnataka, are 43 and 51, respectively. Those in the know say that more players means more people can be obliged. </p>
<p> Kumar Arvind, former BCA joint secretary, claims that selectors were summoned to Tiwary’s home and team lists were changed. “Before the Vijay Hazare tournament, Tiwary called the selectors to his home and replaced seven players. When I refused to sign, he ensured that I was out of BCA. This year for every format there was a new coach,” he said. </p>
<p> Arvind alleges that Ranjan and Tarun Kumar were ousted because coaches were asked to play players who had paid money and that those who disagreed were removed. </p>
<p> Tiwary justifies the jumbo list of players. “The humongous population of Bihar needs representation. I had asked the coach and captain about the many changes in the final Ranji game. I was told since we were out of contention, we tried several players,” he said. </p>
<p> The allegation of sexual harassment against Tiwary is linked to the BCA’s proposed T20 league and the arrest last year of the president of Gurgaon-based Secure Corporate Management, Ashutosh Bora, and his sister Chitra, in an alleged “cash for selection” scam. Chitra, out on bail, has alleged that Tiwary molested her at a five-star hotel in New Delhi. </p>
<p> Asked about the FIR, Tiwary said: “They are still allegations, nothing has been proved yet… I never entertained them. I am innocent.” When contacted, a senior officer of Delhi Police said: “Tiwary was booked under sections of sexual assault. No arrest has been made so far in the case. We are investigating the matter.” </p>
<p> Last year, the BCCI had to intervene in the BCA’s selection matters after a turf war between Tiwary and a rebel group led by former MLA and state BJP spokesperson Prem Ranjan Patel. The Board had also pulled up BCA for hosting the inaugural Bihar Cricket League (BCL) without its permission. </p>

<p> Formula 1 World Champion Max Verstappen has slammed Netflix Series Drive to Survive for ‘faking rivalries’. </p>
<p> Verstappen believes that the show tries to skew public perception of the relationships between drivers. </p>
<p> Max Verstappen not a Drive to Survive fan </p>
<p> The Dutch driver told the BBC that he has only watched two episodes of Drive to Survive, adding that it wasn’t his thing. </p>
<p> “I watched two episodes, but I was not very impressed. It’s just not my thing, faking rivalries,” Verstappen told BBC Sport. </p>
<p> “Lando and Daniel are two great people I know – they have really great characters and immediately at the second episode it looks like they are not very friendly to each other, and for me that’s not correct and that’s why I’m also not a part of it.” </p>
<p> There are those that claim that the series is good for F1 and brings in new fans, but Verstappen is not a fan of distorting perceptions. </p>
<p> Drive to survive taking too much time </p>
<p> He also griped about the abuse of his time, for a sideshow. </p>
<p> “At one point [it helps to bring in audience] but that effect also runs out. I think we’re beyond that stage now and it’s more like a reality show in my opinion. </p>
<p> “Plus, it takes way too much time anyway. I need to focus on the racing and have private time and not spend another half an hour at the race weekend when they need to talk to you.” </p>
<p> Lewis Hamilton is fine </p>
<p> Verstappen also put down any suggestion that Lewis Hamilton is still smarting from his last lap loss of what would have been an eighth world title. </p>
<p> “The sport doesn’t need to heal, there are these dramatic moments which are part of the sport as well,” Verstappen said. </p>
<p> “F1 is a very tough world. I think Lewis can feel the pain a bit less if you already have seven [drivers’ titles].” </p>

<p> Dubai: The 2021 edition of the Emirates Airline Dubai Rugby Sevens will be staged at its regular home at The Sevens Stadium along the Dubai-Al Ain road, from December 2-4. </p>
<p> Now in its 51st year, the annual tournament — a definite highlight in the sporting calendar of the UAE — will mark yet another edition as the world of rugby marks its return to the desert following the cancellation of the 2020 tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p> The annual festival of sport will see more participants than ever before with the addition of a cricket tournament on the world-class ovals of The Sevens Stadium. </p>
<p> Cricket 7s will take its place alongside Netball and Rugby as mass-participation for local, regional and international competition. </p>
<p> Tournament Director, Thomas Burwell looked forward to the 2021 tournament. “It’s with huge excitement that we have the opportunity to announce our 2021 date. We understand from teams and players across the world how excited they are to return to the desert this coming December,” Burwell noted. </p>
<p> “The addition of cricket is very exciting as more sportsmen, women, boys and girls will get the chance to take part in this iconic tournament. Cricket will bring its own flavour and showcase the facilities of The Sevens Stadium,” he added. </p>
<p> “We are also happy to be returning to our traditional dates on the opening weekend of December and due to a reformatting of the schedule, we will be welcoming an increased number of teams in rugby and netball this year. Entries for all three sports will open on March 1,” Burwell stressed. </p>
<p> “I would like to thank the UAE Rugby Federation, World Rugby and the local government stakeholders for their ongoing support of our event,” he added. </p>
<p> Asia Rugby President Qais Abdullah Al Dhalai was also pleased to see the return of such an important event on the sporting calendar of the UAE and the overall Gulf region. “We are pleased to see the planning for the return of the Emirates Dubai 7s and stand in solidarity with all stakeholders to make this an unforgettable event, that will be hosted by Emirates in conjunction with the United Arab Emirates Rugby Federation. We look forward to the participation from Asian nations at this top-class global sevens event,” Al Dhalai remarked. </p>
<p> “As a new leader for the Asian Region, I look forward to seeing an increase in Asian participation at this event,” he hoped. </p>
<p> The Emirates Dubai 7s will feature over 350 teams across the three sports in 2021 with more than 50 per cent of participating teams and players coming from outside the Gulf region underlining the tournaments’ position as a truly global celebration of sport held in the desert of Dubai. </p>

<p> After leaving the Philadelphia 76er's game against the Milwaukee Bucks earlier today with a back injury, Australian Ben Simmons will undergo an MRI tomorrow with fears it could be something serious. The 76ers were thrashed 119-98, courtesy of a monster performance from reigning MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo who finished the match with 31 points, 17 rebounds and eight assists. But midway through the first quarter, Simmons was forced out of the match after he aggravated a lower back injury. Lower back tightness kept the Aussie out of Philadelphia's win over the Brooklyn Nets last Friday. </p>

<p> Senior NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski told ESPN an emotional Simmons was scene after leaving the x-ray room at the Fiserv Forum.

<p> McLaren responds to rumours English team could axe Daniel Ricciardo </p>
<p> McLaren boss Andreas Seidl has rejected claims Daniel Ricciardo could be axed from the team at the end of the season. </p>
<p> The Australian F1 star has experienced a rough first year with the English team following his uneventful stint at Renault, while teammate Lando Norris has outperformed the 32-year-old consistently, leading to rumours McLaren could cut ties at the end of the year. </p>
<p> Asked by reporters if Ricciardo's place in the team next season was in doubt, Seidl said: </p>
<p> "No, not at all. First of all, we have a long-term commitment with Daniel. </p>
<p> "The speed Daniel is having and the experience here with us, we are working hard in order to, let's say, make the next steps on his integration process. </p>
<p> "We're looking forward to see these next steps together and then go into the next year as well." </p>
<p> Rumours had linked George Russell with a move to McLaren saying he would be powered by a Mercedes power unit in 2022. </p>
<p> With Aston Martin, also powered by Mercedes, apparently a closed shop, some had leapt to the conclusion that Russell must therefore be McLaren-bound. </p>
<p> Fernando Alonso and Alpine confirmed that both sides had exercised a clause in the Spaniard's contract that will see him remain with the French manufacturer next season. </p>
<p> Ferrari has a settled line up heading into 2022 and Red Bull looks set to renew Sergio Perez for a second season. </p>
<p> There is less certainty surrounding the likes of Alfa Romeo, Williams, and Haas, though both Mick Schumacher and Nikita Mazepin are expected to remain with the United States-registered team. </p>

<p> Rafael Nadal breaks his silence from quarantine to take thinly veiled shot at Novak Djokovic </p>
<p> Rafael Nadal has taken what appears to be a thinly veiled swipe at Novak Djokovic while breaking his silence from hotel quarantine in Adelaide. </p>
<p> Spanish superstar Nadal was criticised by Argentinian player Guido Pella last week for failing to speak out publicly and fight for the rights of lesser players. </p>
<p> "Djokovic's balcony is bigger than my room," Pella said. </p>
<p> "But at least he said something. </p>
<p> "I'm surprised with Nadal and (Dominic) Thiem's silence." </p>
<p> Australian Open star apologises following diagnosis </p>
<p> "We all try to help each other," the world No 2 said. </p>
<p> "Some need to make public all they do to try to help others, while some of us do it privately without publishing our calls or making propaganda with it." </p>
<p> Nadal and world No 1 Djokovic are two of the stars quarantining in what are perceived as better conditions in Adelaide while lesser lights 'slum it' in Melbourne. </p>
<p> Nadal and Djokovic are allowed five hours per day outside their hotel rooms in 'soft quarantine' while those in hard COVID-19 lockdown are laid low for 14 days. </p>
<p> But Nadal said the situation was more complex than that. </p>
<p> "Where is the line of privileges? I have a different view," he said. </p>
<p> Djokovic claims quarantine requests were ‘misconstrued’ </p>
<p> "Here in Adelaide our conditions have been better than most of the conditions in Melbourne, but some Melbourne players have larger rooms where they can perform physical activities, others smaller rooms where they cannot have contact with their coach or physical trainer. </p>
<p> "Where is the line? </p>
<p> "I have not heard any Melbourne players complain that they have a better room or about those who have been confined without being able to train. </p>
<p> "I have not seen those who complain so much about our conditions in Adelaide say: why are there not equal conditions, now we will all go without training. </p>
<p> "You always look up, always complain about a disadvantageous position." </p>

<p> Emma Raducanu suffers calamitous exit at Miami Open </p>
<p> Emma Raducanu produces an error-strewn performance to bow out 6-3 4-6 5-7 to Katerina Siniakova in the second round of the Miami Open. </p>
<p> Great Britain's Emma Raducanu suffered a calamitous collapse to bow out of her inaugural Miami Open tournament in the second round against Katerina Siniakova in three sets. </p>
<p> The US Open champion was seemingly on the way to victory after taking the first set, but unforced error after unforced error saw her go down 6-3 4-6 5-7 to her counterpart. </p>
<p> Siniakova had to keep her emotions in check after going 5-3 down in the first set, with the Czech Republic player slipping as Raducanu broke her serve before the Brit held in her next game. </p>
<p> Raducanu also posted an early break in the second set, but Siniakova came storming back to force a deciding third set, where Raducanu had the opportunity to serve for the match at 5-4 up. </p>
<p> However, the 19-year-old could not do so, and Siniakova broke her opponent's serve once more in the 12th game of the third set to advance to the third round, with Raducanu failing to take 12 of her 17 opportunities to break on the day. </p>
<p> One Brit's marathon match did end in success earlier on Thursday, though, as Heather Watson won her three-set thriller with Elina Svitolina 4-6 6-3 7-6 [7-4] to book her spot in round three. </p>

<p> Former world 100m champion Kim Collins will compete in the 60m and 200m at the Aviva International Match at Glasgow's Kelvin Hall on 31 January. </p>
<p> It will be the 32-year-old's first appearance in Scotland. </p>
<p> The St Kitts & Nevis sprinter is preparing for the World Championships in Germany in August. </p>
<p> "Winning silver at the World Indoor Championships in March was very satisfactory and I will look to go one better in Berlin," he said. </p>
<p> "Glasgow is a renowned quick track, so I am aiming for a fast time there." </p>
<p> Collins, who came sixth in the 200m Olympic final in Beijing, will be part of a Commonwealth Select up against Great Britain and Northern Ireland, USA, Germany and Sweden. </p>
<p> Athletes at the Aviva International compete to win points for their country. </p>
<p> Britain won the final event last year to take the match by one point. </p>
<p> Collins will also be competing in the 60m at the Aviva Grand Prix at the NIA in Birmingham in February. </p>
<p> Tony McCoy rode Exotic Dancer to a 20-length success in Sunday's Lexus Chase at Leopardstown after favourite Neptune Collonges fell two from home. </p>
<p> Exotic Dancer was going well in second when Ruby Walsh's mount crashed out and he raced away from 2006 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner War Of Attrition. </p>
<p> The Listener, winner of the race two years ago, fell at the first ditch. </p>
<p> Trainer Jonjo O'Neill said the 4-1 winner would return to Leopardstown for February's Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup. </p>
<p> He said connections had still to decide whether to run in the Gold Cup or the Ryanair Chase at the Cheltenham Festival, but bookmakers clearly feel he has a decent chance at the bigger of those two races. </p>
<p> Exotic Dancer was trimmed to 12-1 from 33s with Ladbrokes and the same price from 20-1 with Coral for the Gold Cup - a race in which he finished runner-up in 2007. </p>
<p> From the start of Sunday's three-mile test, McCoy settled Exotic Dancer at the rear of the field as Walsh took up a prominent position on the 5-4 market leader. </p>
<p> He set a sound pace up front as McCoy was happy to bide his time and let Exotic Dancer sit last of the nine runners before making steady progress in the second half of the race. </p>
<p> Coming to the second last, Neptune Collonges was still in front and appeared to have something still to give as Exotic Dancer, War Of Attrition and Cane Brake lined up to challenge. </p>
<p> However, Neptune Collonges crashed through the obstacle, leaving Exotic Dancer in front and travelling best of all. </p>
<p> McCoy just had to keep him going up the straight and after he cleared the last, O'Neill's charge was barely troubled to come home well clear of the tiring War Of Attrition. </p>

<p> Highlights from day five of the fourth Test as India beat England by 157 runs to take a 2-1 series lead with one game to play </p>
<p> England tumbled to a 157-run defeat on day five of the fourth Test at The Kia Oval as a Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja-inspired India took a 2-1 lead in the series with one game to play. </p>
<p> Bumrah (2-27) and Jadeja (2-50) ripped the heart out of England's improbable chase of a record 368 with four wickets for just six runs early in the second session, as the hosts collapsed from 141-2 to 147-6 and eventually 210 all out. </p>
<p> Bumrah bowled Ollie Pope (2) and Jonny Bairstow (0) with outstanding deliveries, making Pope his 100th Test victim during a scintillating spell of reverse swing on a flat deck with those scalps sandwiched by left-arm spinner Jadeja accounting for Haseeb Hameed (63) and Moeen Ali (0). </p>
<p> Joe Root (36) and Chris Woakes (18) looked to rebuild but when Root dragged Shardul Thakur (2-22) onto his stumps 20 minutes before tea, England looked cooked and they went on to be rolled in 92.2 overs as Umesh Yadav (3-60) wiped out the lower order, finishing with the wicket of James Anderson. </p>

<p> Hameed and Rory Burns (50) had earlier extended their overnight opening stand from 77 to 100 to raise hopes that England could trump the 362 they managed against Australia during the 2019 Ashes Test at Emerald Headingley, when Ben Stokes struck a remarkable 135 not out. </p>
<p> But that epic encounter in Leeds remains the team's highest successful Test chase and they now must win the fifth and final Test against India at Emirates Old Trafford from Friday to avoid a second successive home series defeat, having gone down 1-0 to New Zealand in June. </p>
<p> India are now just one good game away from winning their first series in England since 2007 - the forecast in Manchester is not great but hopefully that improves so this thrill-a-minute series ends with a fitting finale. </p>

<p> There were no weather issues at The Oval on Monday with the sold-out ground bathed in sunshine as the fifth day began with all results possible. </p>
<p> England required a further 291 runs and whittled that down 268 before losing their first wicket - Burns snicking a jaffa from Thakur, bowled from around the wicket, through to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant one ball after sealing his 11th Test half-century and hundred partnership with Hameed. </p>
<p> India should have struck again seven overs later but Mohammed Siraj shelled a regulation catch at mid-on off Jadeja when Hameed was on 55. </p>
<p> Dawid Malan (5) was next out, run out by substitute fielder Mayank Agarwal after a mix-up with Hameed - Hameed tapped Jadeja towards cover and set off for a risky single, with Malan short of his ground at the striker's end as Pant collected the throw and whipped off the bails. </p>
<p> Malan had survived a tight lbw review on umpire's call a couple of overs earlier after padding up to Jadeja, with the ball not hitting enough of the stumps for the on-field decision to be overturned. </p>
<p> Siraj, looking to atone for spilling that easy catch, bowled a superb spell prior to lunch, testing both Hameed and Root at the end of a session in which just 54 runs were scored. </p>

<p> Root reverse swept Jadeja's first ball of the afternoon for four, which signalled that, at that stage, England were targeting more than a draw. </p>
<p> Their task became extremely arduous, though, once Hameed - who scored just 20 runs from the 108 balls he faced on day five having hit 43 from 85 on the fourth evening - was bowled by Jadeja. </p>
<p> Jadeja's delivery pitched outside leg and then turned sharply to clip the top of Hameed's off stump, meaning Siraj's blunder only cost India eight runs. </p>
<p> Then it was Bumrah time - the seamer taking 2-6 in six pacey overs as he nipped a delivery onto Pope's stumps via the thigh and then cleaned up Bairstow for a four-ball duck with a devastating, swinging yorker - before Moeen also fell for no score, clipping Jadeja to short leg. </p>

<p> Root and Woakes stemmed the flow of wickets and raised England's slender hopes of a draw but they were then shredded as their captain inside-edged a gentle delivery from Thakur onto his stumps - the dismissal ensuring Root went without a hundred for the first time in the series after tons at Trent Bridge, Lord's and Headingley. </p>
<p> Root then watched on as Umesh had Woakes caught at short midwicket with the old ball and bowled Craig Overton (10) off his elbow with the new one before having Anderson caught behind to end the contest - Anderson's review to no avail. </p>
<p> The tourists' win at The Kia Oval came after a topsy-turvy tussle in which they were 127-7 in their first innings before Thakur's 31-ball fifty propelled them up 191 all out and then 312-6 in their second only for Thakur's second half-century of the game to help them bump that total up to 466. </p>

<p> England on verge of losing Test series to West Indies </p>
<p> Another woeful batting effort leaves England on the brink of losing the third Test and best-of-three series to West Indies. </p>
<p> England are on the brink of losing their Test series with West Indies after a woeful batting performance on day three of the third and final Test match. </p>
<p> Resuming 28 runs adrift of their hosts, England had hoped to take the final two West Indies wickets in rapid fashion, something which seemed possible once Kemar Roach was dismissed without adding to his overnight score of 25. </p>
<p> However, Joshua Da Silva, supported by tailender Jayden Seales, put on 52 for the final wicket, Da Silva recording his first Test century and ending the innings unbeaten on 100. </p>
<p> Now trailing by 93, England needed a response from a batting lineup that had wilted on the opening day, but it was a repeat performance as the majority failed to reach double figures. </p>
<p> That ultimately changed very little, the tourists going from 80-4 to 101-8 as Kyle Mayers ended the day with remarkable figures of 5-9 off 13 overs. </p>
<p> England will resume day four with a 10-run lead but barring another unforeseen stand from the tailenders, like in the first innings, this match is already done as a contest with England facing more embarrassment on their travels. </p>

<p> F1 2022 Pre-season Test: Fastest And Slowest Drivers From All 3 Days Of Bahrain Testing </p>
<p> Take a look at who were the fastest and slowest drivers in the three days of F1 2022 pre-season testing in Bahrain ahead of Saudi Arabian GP. </p>
<p> The F1 2022 season saw the pre-season testing in Bahrain begin on March 10. The 3-day event saw the teams going all out with testing their cars to the maximum, as they will be racing each other in the season opener at the Bahrain International Circuit next weekend. </p>
<p> The 2022 F1 season comes with a significant amount of rules and regulation changes, which brings out the possibility of drivers changing places in the grid, contrasting to what was seen in the 2021 season. Meanwhile, here’s a look at who were the fastest and slowest drivers for the teams during the three days of Bahrain pre-season testing. </p>
<p> Day 1 </p>
<p> The first day of testing ended with Alpha Tauri’s Pierre Gasly topping the time charts with the fastest lap time of 1:33.902 after completing 102 laps in total. Gasly was followed by the Ferrari duo of Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc with timings of 1:34.359 and 1:34.532 respectively. </p>
<p> On the other hand, Haas’ test driver Pietro Fittipaldi finished the day as the slowest driver with a lap time of 1:37.422 in the afternoon/evening session. Fittipaldi was the 15th fastest driver, with Alfa Romeo rookie Zhou Guanyu finishing at P14 with a lap time of 1:37.164. </p>
<p> Day 2 </p>
<p> On Day 2 of Bahrain Testing, Sainz emerged as the fastest driver with the best lap time of 1:33.532, followed by reigning world champion Max Verstappen in P2. Verstappen put up a lap time of 1:34.011 on his Red Bull car, ahead of Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll and 7-time world champion Lewis Hamilton. At the same time, Guanyu was the slowest driver of the day with the best lap time of 1:39.984. </p>
<p> Day 3 </p>
<p> The final day of testing before the first race weekend of the year finished with the reigning world champion at P1 with the best timing of 1:31.720. He was followed by Leclerc and Alpine’s Fernando Alonso in the timing charts at P2 and P3 respectively. Meanwhile, Kevin Magnussen in his Haas finished the final day as the slowest driver in P18. Another surprising name in the chart was Hamilton, who finished Day 3 as the 17th fastest driver. </p>

<p> F1 must enforce budget cap for 2022 title race - Binotto </p>
<p> Mattia Binotto says Formula 1 needs to ensure that top teams are sticking with the budget cap rules. </p>
<p> Mattia Binotto says Formula 1 needs to ensure that top teams are sticking with the budget cap rules. </p>
<p> After the opening two grands prix of the new rules era, it is clear that another new title duel is brewing up - this time between Red Bull and Ferrari while Mercedes tries to claw back an early disadvantage. </p>
<p> "These new cars are still early in their development," former F1 driver Ralf Schumacher told Sky Deutschland. </p>
<p> "I think Ferrari are the furthest along at the moment, but Red Bull is a master at making a car faster over the course of a season. </p>
<p> "Ferrari has to counter that, otherwise it will be difficult with the title. But I think they know that," said the German. </p>
<p> Part of Ferrari team boss Binotto's countering of the Red Bull and Mercedes threat is to wave a red flag about how F1 intends to enforce the teams' $140 million budget limits. </p>
<p> "It will influence the pace of development," he told Corriere della Sera newspaper. </p>
<p> "I think it's a key element and my concern is that we need to make sure that we have proper control over that. It may be, let me say, a game-changer in the development fight," the Italian added. </p>
<p> F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali agrees that "financial control" is an important role for the FIA, with the Paris-based federation currently "equipping itself to be even more robust in its role as a watchdog". </p>
<p> Binotto said Ferrari is taking the budget cap provisions very seriously as it charges for its first world championship since 2008. </p>
<p> "Every development will be important, but with the budget cap you can't spend everything right away," he said. </p>
<p> The Italian also acknowledged Red Bull and Mercedes' much more recent practice in developing a car for a title challenge. </p>
<p> "It is true that our competitors are very strong in this area, whereas as Ferrari the last two opportunities we had were in 2017 and 2018, and we lost some ground because of development," said Binotto. </p>
<p> "Since then, we have improved our tools, the wind tunnel, the methodologies, the process and the simulator. I think that today we are much better prepared than in the past to do the right job also in development. </p>
<p> "We now have a budget cap that will influence the pace of development, and I think that's a key point. My concern is that we need to make sure we have the right policy on this," he added. </p>

<p> WATCH: F1 Driver Nikita Mazepin Sits Courtside at Miami Heat’s NBA Game </p>
<p> Published 10/27/2021, 12:44 PM CEST </p>
<p> F1 returns to the United States after a year’s absence because of the COVID pandemic, and to celebrate its return, Formula 1 has collaborated with one of the most popular sports in the country – NBA, which is marking its 75th anniversary. Several basketball players were spotted throughout the race weekend. And the four-time NBA champion, Shaquille O’Neal, even facilitated the podium winners at the COTA. </p>

<p> And just days after an exhilarating United States Grand Prix, Nikita Mazepin was spotted in the FTX Arena in Miami for an NBA game between Miami Heat and Orlando Magic. Taking to Instagram, Nikita Mazepin uploaded an image from his official account and was observed sitting courtside. The Russian driver wrote, “What a show by Miami Heat.” </p>
<p> Miami Heat comfortably defeated Orlando Magic by 107-90 to register their second win of the season. The three-time NBA champions currently sit fifth in the Eastern Conference table just behind Milwaukee Bucks. </p>
<p> Very lonely, boring, and painful race at COTA: Nikita Mazepin </p>
<p> Nikita Mazepin endured one of the most challenging races at Austin in his rookie season in Formula 1. During the opening lap of the United States Grand Prix, Mazepin’s headrest became dislodged on only turn 2. As a result, the 22-year-old was forced to make an early pit stop which hampered his entire race. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, as quoted by Motorsport, when asked how his race panned out at the Circuit of The Americas, the young Russian driver replied, “Bad. My headrest came off on the first lap in Turn 2. </p>
<p> “It made the first lap very sketchy because I couldn’t see anything in my mirrors. It added an unnecessary pit stop. So yeah, very lonely, boring and painful race, degrading like f**k.” </p>

<p> Furthermore, the Haas driver pointed fingers at his team for the headrest problem. </p>
<p> “I believe it’s a human error. It came off in Turn 2, and it’s never done that in my racing career. So I imagine something was done differently for it to happen,” concluded Nikita Mazepin. </p>

<p> F1 news 2022: Formula 1 abandons pre-race tradition, We Race As One </p>
<p> Formula 1 chiefs have decided to ditch the knee gesture ceremony before races — despite it being supported by a number of drivers. </p>
<p> Formula 1 chiefs have ditched the knee gesture ceremony before races — despite it being supported by a number of drivers. </p>
<p> Since the start of the 2020 season, F1 had assigned time for drivers to take a knee, or make any gesture in support of their “We Race As One” initiative in the pre-race schedule. </p>
<p> However, that will be stopped this season with F1 boss Stefano Domenicali saying the sport needed “action” rather than “gestures”. </p>

<p> He said: “We have to not have to do politics. But I think now it’s a matter from gesture to action. </p>
<p> “Now the action is the focus on the diversity of our community. And this is the first step. </p>
<p> “I think that the gesture has already been important for the ones that believed that it was an important gesture. </p>
<p> “We need to respect everyone as always, but now is the time to move on and take some other action.” </p>
<p> SunSport understands Lewis Hamilton, the sport’s only black driver who took a knee before races, has accepted F1’s plans. </p>
<p> And the seven-time world champ has welcomed F1’s plans to emulate his own project to increase diversity within the sport. </p>
<p> Hamilton funded his own commission to identify why there was such a lack of diversity and has now funded a program to recruit black teachers in key subjects. </p>
<p> F1 now run their own scholarship program for under-represented groups, with 10 students being taken in each year until at least 2025. </p>
<p> Domenicali added: “We needed to make sure that what we did was important to show the intention of Formula One in things that were really important for the world. </p>
<p> “I think now it’s the matter of (changing) gesture, to action. Now the action is the focus on the diversity of our community, and this is the first step.” </p>
<p> Meanwhile, Hamilton was back at Mercedes’ HQ in Brackley on Tuesday – stopping talk of him retiring. </p>
<p> And Domenicali reckoned the 37-year-old will be fully-motivated to win back the title from Max Verstappen. </p>
<p> He said: “From what I know and what I see, I saw the last picture of Lewis with the right positivity in his face and his gesture. </p>
<p> “I think that is important because Lewis is an incredible asset, not only for our sport, but for the world. </p>
<p> “And Lewis, he has in front of him a possibility to be, for the eighth time, a world champion. </p>
<p> “I’m pretty sure that he’s totally focused on this objective because this year, there will be so many new things, so many new variables, and that will allow these champions to be so attractive. </p>
<p> “Going back to Lewis, I’m sure that he’s totally dedicated to make sure that he can really have his chance to be for the eighth time the world champion.” </p>

<p> F1 news LIVE: Max Verstappen reacts to Lewis Hamilton retirement talk as Brit still silent </p>
<p> Mercedes are still aggrieved over the result of Sunday’s wildly controversial Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as the dust continues to settle on Max Verstappen’s remarkable Drivers’ Championship victory. The Dutchman picked up his trophy at yesterday’s FIA Prize Giving Ceremony, with runner-up Lewis Hamilton and Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff nowhere to be seen. </p>
<p> The pair decided to boycott the event in Paris just hours after Mercedes dropped their appeal over the FIA’s decision to wave away their protests regarding the race result. </p>
<p> Hamilton was cruelly denied a record-breaking eighth title in Abu Dhabi after Verstappen reaped the rewards of a late safety car period to clinch the honours on the final lap. </p>
<p> Mercedes released a lengthy statement on Thursday explaining their decision to withdraw their appeal, pledging to hold the FIA to account over the investigation to establish what happened during the closing stages of the race at the Yas Marina Circuit. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, Hamilton is yet to speak about the events of the last few laps despite making an appearance to receive his knighthood at Windsor Castle on Wednesday. </p>
<p> Express Sport is on hand to provide live updates from the world of F1 throughout the day in the wake of Sunday’s historic race. </p>

<p> Mercedes chief Toto Wolff has issued a cold response after Christian Horner called the Austrian out for living as a ‘tax exile’. The two team principals have a tense rivalry both on and off the grid. And that led to the battle between Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen last year sometimes boiling over. </p>
<p> Related articles </p>
<p> Mercedes have been the dominant team in F1 recent years, with Hamilton and Nico Rosberg before him both experiencing success. </p>
<p> But Red Bull were back with a bang last year, claiming driver's title glory at the final race of the calendar in Abu Dhabi in controversial circumstances. </p>
<p> Over the past year or so, the rivalry between Wolff and Horner has intensified. </p>
<p> And while the Red Bull chief recently insisted he had no issue with his Mercedes counterpart, he fired a dig at Wolff by labelling him a ‘tax exile’. </p>
<p> “We are very different,” Horner said in a recent interview with the Daily Mail. </p>
<p> "If I'm not at the racetrack, I'm in the factory. I'm not living as a tax exile in Monaco, running a team remotely. </p>

<p> “Toto has a very different background. He has a financial background and is very driven by what the balance sheet says. </p>
<p> “Results dictate that performance.” </p>
<p> Horner did also stress he and Wolff have an amicable relationship, despite their previous war of words suggesting otherwise. </p>
<p> “My relationship with Toto is… you know, it’s professional,” Horner added. </p>

<p> Mercedes chief Toto Wolff has admitted to doubts over whether Lewis Hamilton can win a record eighth F1 title this year.

<p> Hamilton and Mercedes had a turbulent pre-season, encountering issues with their vehicle while still reeling from December’s dramatic F1 finale defeat to Max Verstappen and Red Bull. </p>
<p> However, they managed to put that adversity behind them by finishing third in Bahrain on Sunday afternoon. </p>
<p> Hamilton was fortunate that Verstappen and Sergio Perez were both forced to retire and admitted in the aftermath that he was pleased with the outcome of the race. </p>
<p> Some believe, however, that the 37-year-old will have his work cut out when it comes to moving ahead of Michael Schumacher in the history books. </p>
<p> And Wolff, who has recently sounded pessimistic about his star driver’s chances, has now added to the doubt. </p>
<p> When asked by BILD what he thinks is more realistic between petrol prices dropping in Germany or Hamilton winning another title first, he responded by saying: “Phew, hard to say: I don't think the price of oil will change much in the future, but if OPEC agrees to open production, things can happen quickly. </p>

<p> “That's why I say: First, the price of fuel will go down again.” </p>
<p> Wolff also played down the chances of any big changes in Jeddah this weekend, insisting they need to come to a conclusion as to why they’re ‘lacking’ behind their rivals. </p>
<p> “We need to understand where we're lacking in performance,” added the Austrian. </p>

<p> After F1 drivers considered a boycott over the nearby explosions, the Grand Prix Drivers' Association said it hoped the Saudi Arabian GP would be "remembered as a good race". </p>
<p> Sunday at the high speed and treacherous Jeddah street circuit most certainly delivered. </p>
<p> "This was one of the best races I've seen in the last ten years," said Red Bull's Dr Helmut Marko. </p>
<p> World champion Max Verstappen emerged with the winner's trophy after a long and intense wheel-to-wheel scrap with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, which proved that the all-new 2022 regulations have indeed delivered good racing. </p>
<p> "The drivers deliver what the rules promised," Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said. </p>
<p> "We have seen two spectacular races, overtaking manoeuvres, mixed up starting grids and an extremely tight midfield." </p>
<p> Dutchman Verstappen also appears to have refined his aggressive driving style over the winter, although he says it's the ground effect cars that require different racing tactics. </p>
<p> "You have to plan the overtaking manoeuvres much more than before," he said. </p>
<p> Former F1 driver Ralf Schumacher told Sky Deutschland that was refreshing to see, with Verstappen "understanding that he had to tackle his opponent differently". </p>
<p> "It really was pure joy to watch," said the German, who was speaking from Munich after leaving Saudi Arabia over Friday's explosions. </p>
<p> "It was a duel on an equal footing and both of them know exactly what tricks to use against the other." </p>
<p> Leclerc agrees that F1 has made a "clear step forward" with close-quarter racing, although he agreed with Verstappen that the new 18-inch tyres degrade quickly. </p>
<p> "The balance of the car is much more predictable," he said. "Last year it was very difficult to understand whether you will lose the front or the rear." </p>
<p> Marko thinks the difference from 2021 to 2022 is "unbelievable". </p>
<p> "After last year we didn't believe it could be any better, but that's how it's looking," said the 78-year-old. </p>
<p> "What this organisation has been very good at is not only succeeding in making the races more exciting, but the new approach of the management of the race is also good," he told NOS. </p>
<p> "No stupid decisions were made. Leclerc occasionally went over a line, some lights were not working, but there was no nit-picking. The racing was left to be very pure," Lammers added. </p>
<p> McLaren boss Andreas Seidl concluded: "The big winners are Formula 1 and the fans." </p>

<p> Four-time Drivers' Champion Sebastian Vettel sported a new helmet for F1 Testing on Thursday in a bid to showcase his support for Ukraine amidst Russia's continuing invasion. </p>
<p> March 10th marked the 15th day of the Russia-Ukraine war that has resulted in massive destruction across the streets of major Ukrainian cities including Kharkiv and Kyiv, with several innocent civilians losing their lives. </p>
<p> F1 news: Sebastian Vettel wears 'no war' helmet </p>
<p> As seen in the Tweet below, Aston Martin F1 driver Sebastian Vettel wore a 'no war' helmet on Thursday for the first day of the Bahrain F1 Testing that included the yellow Ukrainian flag instead of the colours of the German flag. However, this is not the first time the German has come out in support of Ukrainians, having been one of the first drivers to make his stance clear that he would not race at the Russian Grand Prix (that is now cancelled). </p>
<p> According to AP, Vettel had said, "I woke up to this morning’s news shocked. I think it’s horrible to see what is happening. Obviously, if you look at the calendar we have a race scheduled in Russia (on Sept. 25),” Vettel said Thursday at pre-season testing in Barcelona. My own opinion is I should not go, I will not go," he said. "I think it’s wrong to race in the country. I’m sorry for the innocent people that are losing their lives, that are getting killed (for) stupid reasons and a very strange and mad leadership,” he added. </p>

<p> Victoria Azarenka opens up on 'extremely stressful' personal struggles after Miami Open exit </p>
<p> Victoria Azarenka has apologised to her fans and opponent after abruptly exiting the court without returning during a match at the Miami Open. </p>
<p> Azerenka, the No.12 seed in the women's draw, was down 2-6 0-3 against world No.279 Linda Fruhvirtova, when she stormed off the court without shaking the Czech teen's hand. </p>
<p> Following the match, the two-time Australian Open champ shed some light on the reasons behind her stunning exit. </p>
<p> "I shouldn't have gone on the court today," she told reporters. </p>
<p> "The last few weeks have been extremely stressful in my personal life. Last match took so much out of me, but I wanted to play in front of a great audience as they helped me pull through my first match. </p>
<p> "I wanted to go out there and try but it was a mistake." </p>
<p> The 32-year-old indicated that she in intends to take a break away from the game for the time being, before apologising to both her 16-year-old opponent and the fans. </p>
<p> "I'm sorry for the fans for what happened as you were great to cheer for me," she said. "It was the only reason I decided to step on the court." </p>
<p> "I always look forward to the challenge and pressure of competition but today it was too much. I have to and will learn from this. </p>
<p> "I would like to congratulate my opponent and wish her best of luck in this tournament and beginning of her professional career." </p>
<p> Due to her walkover win, Fruhvirtova will face Spanish No.5 seed Paula Badosa in the fourth round of the Miami Open. </p>

<p> Western Force land highly rated coach Simon Cron to replace Tim Sampson at season's end </p>
<p> The Western Force have executed a surprise mid-season coup by landing highly regarded New Zealander Simon Cron to be their next coach. </p>
<p> Cron, a former Waratahs assistant currently coaching Toyota Verblitz in Japan, will replace Tim Sampson at the end of the 2022 campaign. </p>
<p> Sampson has done an admirable job with the Force, who sit seventh on the Super Rugby Pacific ladder with a 2-4 record. </p>

<p> But the club's billionaire owner, mining magnate Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest, was confident he had secured the services of one of the world's best up and coming coaches to take his squad to the next level. </p>
<p> "Simon is one of world rugby's most talented young coaches whose philosophy is to make better rugby players, both on and off the field," Forrest said. </p>
<p> "It is his dedication to values, player wellbeing and growth, as well as his respected coaching ability, that we are really looking forward to at the Force. </p>
<p> "Simon's leadership and technical knowledge of the game will be welcomed by the player and coaching team at the Force, as it builds to be a true powerhouse in world rugby. </p>
<p> "A huge thanks to Tim Sampson for his great and tireless role in bringing the Force back into Super Rugby. He has been a true champion of the club." </p>
<p> Cron has also coached the Australian under-20s, Sydney Rays and Northern Suburbs and was mentored by Rugby World Cup-winning mastermind Steve Hansen in Japan. </p>
<p> Toyota are currently fifth in Japan Rugby League One with a 6-4 record. </p>
<p> "I see the Western Force as a club which has fought through adversity and come out the other side because of a genuine love of rugby within the organisation and its amazing supporters, the Sea of Blue," Cron said. </p>
<p> "I look forward to working with the players, coaches and staff to develop a team that will inspire the next generation of Western Australian boys and girls to want to play rugby, as well as help those currently playing to grow within our game." </p>
<p> Sampson issued a classy message after learning his contract would not be extended. </p>
<p> "My focus hasn't changed. We are determined to achieve success and perform well for the remainder of the season," Sampson said. </p>
<p> Force chief executive Tony Lewis said Cron's appointment showed the club's lofty ambition. </p>

<p> "He will be a great addition to the club as we continue to strive to be a world class organisation," Lewis said. </p>
<p> "He brings outstanding leadership and will bring the best out of the coaches and players. Both the club and Simon are hungry for results and we must continue to push the limits. </p>
<p> "To do this he will attract, retain, develop and produce the next generation of Wallabies players through the Force high performance system and lead the development of the best Australian coaches within the Western Force. </p>

<p> Fans Fume As Jenson Brooksby Hits Ball Boy With Racket Yet Escapes Disqualification </p>
<p> American tennis player Jenson Brooksby hit a ball boy with his racquet in an angry outburst during a Miami Open match on Thursday. </p>
<p> American tennis player Jenson Brooksby hit a ball boy with his racquet in an angry outburst during a Miami Open match on Thursday. The incident occurred in the 3rd set of a match between Brooksby and Argentina's Federico Coria. Brooksby lost his temper after missing a serve, tossing his racquet behind the court. The racquet hit the ball boy on his legs. Following the incident, umpire Carlos Bernardes handed Brooksby a minor penalty, deducting one point from his total score. </p>
<p> Ostapenko Broady revisited as first Jenson Brooksby lets go of racquets which is evaded by ballsperson#MiamiOpen Gets a point penalty while his opponent Coria then argues for something harsher👇 pic.twitter.com/iXudIXwgdz </p>
<p> However, it has now prompted a social media debate, with tennis fans criticising the harshness of Brooksby's punishment after he was spared disqualification. </p>
<p> Former American tennis player Patrick McEnroe was among those who chastised US tennis for not punishing Brooksby more severely. The 55-year-old turned to his official Twitter handle to react to the incident as he wrote, “Seriously what is it going to take …drawing blood …to properly punish a tennis player. This is absolutely absurd". </p>
<p> Seriously what is it going to take …drawing blood …to properly punish a tennis player. This is absolutely absurd. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, supporters of Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic also joined the bandwagon on Twitter, suggesting that if the 20-time Grand Slam winner had been involved in the episode, he would not have gotten away with just a point deduction. Fans reminded how Djokovic was kicked out of the 2020 US Open after accidentally hitting a line judge in the throat with a tennis ball. </p>
<p> Well Novak was kicked out of the US Open for hitting a ball that hit the ball person. Tossing a racquet is much worse, in my opinion. </p>
<p> as Rafa said, if there are no rules players will just keep doing it until something serious happens...sad! </p>
<p> He should have been disqualified...the ball boy could have been seriously injured. </p>
<p> When the players start doing what the officials won’t do and start monitoring themselves, maybe this behavior will stop. When those put in danger by thrown rackets start suing, it will definitely stop. </p>
<p> Last month, when German tennis player Alexander Zverev was involved in a similar outburst during a match at the Mexican Open, he was thrown out of the tournament and was fined $40,000. Zverev was handed the punishment after he hit the umpire's chair with his racquet following his defeat against doubles pair Lloyd Glasspool and Harri Heliovaara. </p>
<p> Brooksby vs Coria </p>
<p> As far as the match is concerned, Brooksby came back from a set down to beat Coria 3-6, 6-2, 6-3. Going into the match, Brooksby climbed two places in the live rankings to No. 37, a career-best for the 21-year-old. Before the match versus Brooksby, Coria had also risen in the live rankings to become the new world No. 59. Brooksby will now lock horns against Georgia's Nikoloz Basilashvili in the second round of the Miami Open on Saturday. </p>

<p> This week, the PGA Tour travels to the Dominican Republic for the 2022 Corales Puntacana Championship. Let’s take a look at this week’s PGA Tour event from a fantasy golf perspective. </p>
<p> Before I discuss my fantasy golf player selections I wanted to emphasize that the purpose of this article is not to provide an exact lineup for a specific fantasy provider. Having stated that, this article will provide multiple player options in an effort to assist the reader in generating a unique lineup that will hopefully have the potential to win a GPP (guaranteed prize pool) contest! </p>
<p> Here are my DFS player selections for the 2022 Corales Puntacana Championship. </p>
<p> PALM HARBOR, FLORIDA – MARCH 19: Jhonattan Vegas of Venezuela plays his shot from the first tee during the third round of the Valspar Championship on the Copperhead Course at Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club on March 19, 2022 in Palm Harbor, Florida. (Photo by Douglas P. DeFelice/Getty Images) </p>
<p> Jhonattan Vegas </p>
<p> Jhonattan Vegas fired a first round 64 at last week’s 2022 Valspar Championship en route to an eventual 27th place finish. </p>
<p> Due to the fact that Vegas played relatively well last week, I decided to take a hard look at the player statistics for the event to see how Jhonattan fared relative to the field. Upon completion of four rounds of competitive play at the 2022 Valspar Championship, in relation to the field, Jhonattan Vegas ranked seventh in strokes gained putting (1.64), first in driving distance (313.6 yards), and seventh in GIR (greens in regulation-72.2%). </p>
<p> Vegas also checks the box for me when it comes to previous event/course history. Vegas has played this week’s PGA Tour event three times since 2019. In those three tournaments just mentioned, Vegas has accumulated two top 26 finishes, including an 18th place result at the 2021 Corales Puntacana Championship. </p>
<p> Greyson Sigg </p>
<p> In January, Greyson Sigg posted a first round 65 at the 2022 American Express on his way to an eventual 25th place result. </p>
<p> I also like the fact that Sigg has performed well at this week’s event in the past. More specifically, Greyson Sigg finished ninth at the 2021 Corales Puntacana Championship. </p>
<p> Graeme McDowell </p>
<p> Earlier this month, Graeme McDowell posted a third round 69 at the 2022 Arnold Palmer Invitational en route to a 13th place finish. </p>
<p> Upon completion of four rounds of competitive play at the 2022 Arnold Palmer Invitational, in relation to the field, Graeme McDowell ranked tenth in putting average (1.68) and 19th in driving accuracy (60.7%). </p>
<p> It should also be noted that Graeme McDowell won the 2019 Corales Puntacana Championship. </p>
<p> Joel Dahmen </p>
<p> Joel Dahmen has accumulated three top 39 finishes in his last six tournaments played on the PGA Tour, including a sixth place result at the 2022 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am last month. Dahmen also won the 2021 Corales Puntacana Championship. Clearly, Dahmen likes playing this golf tournament. </p>
<p> Additional players I like this week: Adam Svensson: Nate Lashley: Kramer Hickok: David Hearn. </p>

<p> Fiji’s first Nike jerseys are here… and they’re incredible – Rugby Shirt Watch </p>
<p> June 29, 2021 c_admin Rugby Comments Off on Fiji’s first Nike jerseys are here… and they’re incredible – Rugby Shirt Watch </p>
<p> Since we revealed a few weeks ago that Fiji has signed a deal with Nike, the rugby world has been on tenterhooks to see exactly what this stunning partnership between the world’s leading apparel brand and one of the game’s most iconic sides would look like, and now we finally know. </p>
<p> The brand new Fijian 7s jersey is being launched ahead of the participation of Fiji’s men’s and women’s sides in this weekend’s Oceania 7s tournament, and already it’s one of the best jerseys of the season, if not ever. </p>
<p> When the tie-up with Nike was announced, the FRU confirmed that the new jerseys would incorporate traditional Masi art, and we can see that in the intricate patterns that run around the sleeves of the jersey, but that’s hardly the standout thing here. </p>
<p> The best sevens jerseys are the ones that eschew traditional designs to go for something that’s bold, inventive and memorable, and here Nike have really stepped things up. Instead of a plain white jersey, as is tradition, we instead have a striking pattern of black jagged diagonal hoops, run through with blue pinstriping. </p>
<p> The blue of course is a nod to the Pacific ocean, and is also the primary colour of the training gear that was launched shortly after the Nike announcement was made, so it’s great to see that carry on to the main jersey and tie the whole range together. </p>
<p> This is of course just the first Fiji jersey that Nike will produce – the Flying Fijians test jersey is due to be revealed in the run-up to their test series against the All Blacks in July, and there’s also the small matter of an Olympics gold medal to defend. While no mention of whether the Fiji team will wear Nike at the Olympics has yet been made, that could be an opportunity for even more Fiji x Nike fun. </p>
<p> As for what the Flying Fijians jerseys will look like, well we doubt they’ll be quite as eye-catching as the Sevens, but that’s entirely appropriate for test rugby, and in fact we think there’s a hint already. If the test jersey isn’t plain white with a black collar and the same Masi art that’s on the sleeves of the Sevens shirt, we’ll be very surprised. </p>
<p> Stay tuned to find out if we’re right about that or not… </p>

<p> Football ground fights – Boxing News </p>
<p> British boxing has a long history of football ground fights, writes Miles Templeton </p>
<p> TOP-FLIGHT boxing in Britain has always had a strong connection to football grounds. In recent years, Tony Bellew has fought at Goodison Park and Josh Warrington at Elland Road, while Ricky Hatton boxed in front of close to 60,000 people at the City of Manchester Stadium, now known as the Etihad Stadium. In 1993, Nigel Benn and Chris Eubank drew in a classic encounter at Old Trafford. Most famously of all, Wembley Stadium has been the scene of some of Britain’s biggest contests. The first one occurred in 1924, when Jack Bloomfield met the American, Tommy Gibbons, on a show that bankrupted the promoter, while Muhammad Ali and Henry Cooper boxed there in 1963. </p>
<p> Sadly, some of these great stadia have been demolished. The second time that Cooper crossed gloves with Ali, on this occasion for the world heavyweight championship, was at Highbury in 1966. Not to be outdone, Arsenal’s great rivals, Tottenham" 24956 target="_blank">Tottenham Hotspur, allowed the use of White Hart Lane, also now long gone, for Frank Bruno and Joe Bugner in 1987. White Hart Lane was also the venue where, 45 years previously, Freddie Mills won the British light-heavyweight title by knocking out the great Len Harvey. Elsewhere, Bombardier Billy Wells boxed at St James’ Park, Newcastle, in 1916, where he defeated Dick Smith of Woolwich for the British heavyweight title. </p>
<p> This week, I’d like to tell you about a series of high-class shows that occurred between 1948 and 1951 at Selhurst Park, the home of Crystal Palace, now doing so well in the Premier League. The ground was built in 1924 but no boxing was held there until after the war, as the original Crystal Palace, a magnificent glass structure built in 1851, was situated close by. This building, which burnt to the ground in 1936, regularly featured boxing throughout the 1930s, both indoors and in the open air. </p>
<p> In 1948, there was an extremely good crop of middles, light-heavies and heavyweights based out of Croydon and nearby. Selhurst Park was only a few miles away and so it was the obvious place to hold large-scale events in that area. Once the war had ended, sport then boomed, with large numbers of people desperate to get back to some sort of normality after six years of austerity and hardship. I suspect something similar might happen later this year. </p>
<p> There were six shows held at the ground over that four-year period and all of them took place, as one would expect, in the summer months. Not only was the weather more reliable for outdoor shows but there was no football to compete against. The promoters for the first five events were Bill Goodwin and Alf Hart, and for the last one, in 1951, Ron Johnson. </p>
<p> The undoubted star of these shows was Albert Finch [pictured above]. He ruled as British middleweight champion in 1950, beating Dick Turpin for the title before losing it to Dick’s brother, Randolph, six months later. On the first show at Selhurst Park, in 1948, Finch beat Jock Taylor, of Sidcup, in seven rounds on a bill topped by another Croydon middle, Mark Hart. Nine weeks later, Finch returned to win a Southern Area middleweight title eliminator against Kilburn’s Bert Sanders in front of 10,000 people. He then beat Hart for that title in an all-Croydon bout staged at the town’s Davis Theatre. </p>
<p> In 1949, in his final fight before challenging Dick Turpin in his first, losing, bid for the British title, Finch knocked out Bob Cleaver in seven rounds at the ground. He returned there the following summer, in his first contest as the new champion, when he stopped Juan Torrecillas, of Spain, in three. In his last bout at Selhurst Park, Finch hammered the South African, Billy Wood, in five rounds in May 1951. He won all of his five contests at the stadium, four of them inside the distance, and how the crowd loved him. Finch died in 2003 but he is still remembered by many in Croydon and beyond. </p>

<p> Mark Hughes has been appointed as manager of Bradford City. </p>
<p> The Welshman has been away from the managerial hotseat since leaving Southampton in 2018. </p>
<p> But he has returned to the dugout in League Two, signing a two-and-a-half year contract with the Bantams. </p>
<p> Hughes said: “I am really pleased to be here and am looking forward to the role, and the job in hand. It has been an exciting few days. </p>
<p> “It is maybe a little bit of a surprise that I have come in, but do not be put off by that! </p>
<p> “I am here for a reason: to make Bradford City a team people want to come and watch - and are proud to watch. </p>
<p> “The supporters come in their numbers, and that is the thing I have missed since being out of management. I am looking forward to the matchday, getting that adrenaline flowing and interacting with the crowd. </p>
<p> “Certainly, from now until the end of the year, we just want to finish strongly and see where that takes us. </p>
<p> “We want to move the club and everybody with it forward, and hope we can have the success everyone wants.” </p>
<p> Hughes - who won 72 caps for his country - started his managerial career with Wales and led the Red Dragons to the Euro 2004 play-offs. </p>
<p> He has gone on to take charge of Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, Fulham, Queens Park Rangers, Stoke City and most recently Southampton. </p>
<p> And on Friday morning, it was confirmed that he has been appointed as Derek Adams' successor at Valley Parade. </p>
<p> Bradford' chief executive officer Ryan Sparks said: “We are delighted to have secured Mark’s services, and I am looking forward to working alongside him. </p>
<p> “His record and stature in the game speaks for itself, and he has achieved a great deal. To have him in our dugout is representative of the club’s ambition and desire to be successful. </p>
<p> “Mark expressed an interest in becoming our manager and, following talks between he, myself and Stefan (Rupp), we are today thrilled to be in a position to unveil him. </p>
<p> “This is without doubt one of the most significant appointments in the history of our football club. Mark recognises our true potential - and has the desire to ensure we fulfil it. </p>
<p> “Mark will be provided with the tools he requires in order to achieve our goals - be that in coaching, recruitment, sports science, medicine or any other area. </p>
<p> “He is relishing the challenges ahead and has repeatedly proven himself to thrive at elite levels of the game, in high-pressure situations. </p>
<p> “I hope you can join us on Saturday, when we face Mansfield Town, so Mark can be given a proper Valley Parade welcome as he leads us into the closing months of the season and beyond.” </p>
<p> Bradford are currently 15th in League Two and have lost their last three games in a row. </p>

<p> Max Verstappen loathes exaggerated rivalries and the Formula One champion won't be pulled into a manufactured feud with Charles Leclerc as he attempts to defend his title this season. </p>
<p> It took three laps for Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc to show why he is a potential Formula One title contender, heading into this weekend's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. </p>
<p> Formula One champion Max Verstappen’s title defense turned into a nightmare when the Red Bull star retired near the end of the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday allowing Ferrari to clinch a 1-2 finish with Charles Leclerc winning ahead of teammate Carlos Sainz Jr. </p>
<p> Ferrari's Charles Leclerc stunned Formula One champion Max Verstappen by taking a brilliant pole position for the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix on Saturday. </p>
<p> Formula One champion Max Verstappen quickly got back to business for Red Bull by leading the second practice session at the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix under floodlights on Friday. </p>

<p> Seven-time Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton has no plans to emulate sporting greats like Tom Brady and Roger Federer by competing in his 40s. </p>
<p> Lewis Hamilton was not feeling optimistic as the last day of Formula One preseason testing Saturday raised questions about how Mercedes will fare when the season starts next weekend. </p>
<p> Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz set the fastest time during preseason testing on Friday, while Kevin Magnussen was back for Haas in the place of fired Russian driver Nikita Mazepin. </p>
<p> Red Bull team principal Christian Horner sees nothing illegal in the new-look Mercedes car, and is far more concerned how Formula One’s budget cap will impact teams given the “circumstances we have in the world.” </p>
<p> AlphaTauri driver Pierre Gasly had the fastest time in Formula One pre-season testing on Thursday, where much focus was on the new-look Mercedes car and American team Haas missing the morning start after some of its equipment didn't arrive on time. </p>

<p> Formula 1: 2022 lineup rumors are already heating up </p>
<p> Even before the 2021 Formula 1 season got underway, there was already some intense discussion about what next year’s lineup may look like. </p>
<p> At some point, you just have to enjoy what’s in front of you. That “some point” rarely happens in motorsport, however, when there is almost always speculation about what the future will look like before actually dealing with the present. Formula 1 is no exception to that. </p>
<p> The 2021 season, which is slated to feature a record-breaking 23 races after the 2020 season was shortened from what would have been a record-breaking 22 races to 17 races due to various coronavirus pandemic-related restrictions around the globe, got underway this past Sunday, March 28 at Bahrain International Circuit with the Bahrain Grand Prix. </p>
<p> And even before that, there were various rumors and discussions about what the 2022 driver lineup may look like, particularly that of the seven-time reigning world champions. </p>
<p> These talks have really been heating up for some time now, given the current situation at Mercedes, but Zak Brown recently offered an interesting take. </p>
<p> Mercedes signed Valtteri Bottas to a fifth consecutive one-year deal last August, but despite the fact that Lewis Hamilton has now won six of the last seven world titles with the team, including each of the last four, he did not sign a new contract with the Silver Arrows until a month before preseason testing began. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, he has returned to the team for 2021 (and already won a race), but only on a one-year deal. That alone led to some interesting speculation, given what his reported contract demands were during the months and months of negotiations. </p>
<p> Brown believes that the 2021 season will be the last for both Bottas and Hamilton at Mercedes, and he believes that the Brackley-based team will be swinging for the fences with their 2022 duo by promoting George Russell and bringing in Max Verstappen from Red Bull. </p>
<p> “I think that is the obvious conclusion. You’ll see Max and George there in 2022. Lewis wins title number eight this year and is [victorious] in every category; they have a one-year deal with him. George is coming out of his deal, and Max has a deal he comes out of. You have Max’s experience and youth, and you have George’s youth,” Brown continued. “If I am Mercedes, that’s a pretty killer lineup for the next five years. The interesting thing is, what does Red Bull do? That’s a harder one to answer.” </p>
<p> Russell is a Mercedes junior driver, and he was impressive in his debut for the team in last year’s Sakhir Grand Prix at Bahrain International Circuit, which Hamilton missed after testing positive for COVID-19. </p>
<p> The 23-year-old Briton barely even fit in the car and still would have won the race if not for a botched pit sequence by the team and an ensuring flat tire. </p>
<p> For years, there have been talks about Russell being promoted to the works team, and he is currently in his final year of a three-year agreement with Williams. </p>
<p> As for Verstappen, he is under contract with Red Bull through the 2023 season, but there is a performance clause in his contract that would allow him to leave the team after the 2021 season should they not be able to provide him with a car capable of challenging Mercedes for the title. </p>
<p> Naturally, the driver who many believe to be the most talented driver on the grid would look in one direction if it came to leaving Red Bull, and that would be Mercedes. </p>
<p> Red Bull are set to take over Honda’s engine project after the 2021 season with the engine manufacturer set to leave the sport, so if they don’t produce what Verstappen needs to be able to win this year, it would make 100% sense for him to look for something better next year. </p>
<p> So is Brown’s prediction really off-the-wall, or will it come to fruition? Regardless, let’s enjoy the remaining 22 races on this year’s 23-race calendar, especially coming off of one of the most uncertain seasons that the sport has ever seen. </p>
<p> The next race on the schedule is the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix, which is set to be broadcast live on ESPN from Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari beginning at 9:00 a.m. ET on Sunday, April 18. </p>

<p> Formula 1: 5 mistakes that cost Lewis Hamilton the championship </p>
<p> Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes, Formula 1 (Photo by Stefan Klingberg ATPImages/Getty Images) </p>
<p> Mercedes made four key mistakes that cost Lewis Hamilton the Formula 1 world championship, and Max Verstappen made one that actually helped his cause. </p>
<p> The controversy surrounding last Sunday’s 2021 season-ending and Formula 1 world championship-deciding race at the 16-turn, 3.281-mile (5.280-kilometer) Yas Marina Circuit road course on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates will certainly last through the offseason and beyond. </p>
<p> On the very first lap, Max Verstappen dove inside Lewis Hamilton entering turn six and forced his rival off the track, prompting a debate as to whether Hamilton should have had to give the place back. </p>
<p> Red Bull’s lobbying was fruitless, but race control’s response indicated that the policy for the day would be to actually let the championship be decided on the track. Hamilton was much faster all night, but a series of bad decisions on the pit wall ultimately overwhelmed his on-track advantage. </p>
<p> When race director Michael Masi made the call to clear only the lapped cars that were between the two title contenders before a final lap of racing, Mercedes had a scapegoat for their consistently awful approach to the entire race weekend. </p>
<p> In the end, team leadership at Mercedes had no one to blame but themselves. </p>
<p> And if it had not been for a potentially devastating on-track mistake during qualifying, Verstappen and Red Bull may not have even been in a strategic position to win the race — and his first world championship. </p>
<p> All of this makes Mercedes’ refusal to attend the season-ending FIA prize-giving gala seem like the petulant act of an organization unwilling to admit their own shortcomings, which comes as no surprise to anyone who follows the sport. </p>
<p> There were several key moments in which Toto Wolff and Peter Bonnington failed their driver and their team with conservative decisions. That manner of leadership won them championships when their cars and drivers were head and shoulders ahead of the field, but those days are apparently gone. </p>
<p> Where Mercedes hesitated, Red Bull pounced — repeatedly. The gap in decision making was clearly noticeable throughout the weekend. </p>
<p> Here are five mistakes that ultimately cost Mercedes and Hamilton. </p>

<p> Formula 1: Another surprise Lewis Hamilton replacement emerging? </p>
<p> There is still uncertainty about Lewis Hamilton’s future, or lack thereof, in Formula 1, even as 2022 preseason testing draws closer. </p>
<p> Ever since his heartbreaking last-lap defeat at the hands of Red Bull’s Max Verstappen in the 2021 Formula 1 championship-deciding season finale at Yas Marina Circuit, Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton has remained silent, save for his post-race interview with Sky Sports in the immediate aftermath of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix chaos. </p>
<p> Despite the fact that he signed a two-year contract extension to remain with the Silver Arrows through the 2023 season over the summer, rumors continue to swirl that the seven-time world champion will not be back for the 2022 campaign, given how the 2021 season ended. </p>
<p> There is still nothing confirmed about the future of the 37-year-old Briton, even with preseason testing scheduled to get underway in just over a month, and this has led to speculation about potential replacements if he does indeed walk away. </p>
<p> Mercedes have already replaced Valtteri Bottas with George Russell for 2022. Could a complete lineup overhaul be looming? </p>
<p> Recent discussions seem to indicate that Mercedes would target AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly, given the success he has had with the Red Bull sister team — and the fact that this move could deal quite a blow to the Red Bull organization if it were actually pulled off. </p>
<p> However, one report that suggests that the likely replacement, if one is needed, for Hamilton for the 2022 season is Esteban Ocon. </p>
<p> Ocon used to be a member of the Mercedes Junior Team from 2016 to 2019. He competed for the Mercedes-powered Manor Racing MRT team during the latter stages of the 2016 season before competing for the Mercedes-powered Force India team in 2017 and 2018, but he lost his ride after the 2018 season. </p>
<p> During the 2019 season, when he had no ride, there was speculation that he would replace Bottas alongside Hamilton ahead of the 2020 season. But the team ended up re-signing Bottas, and Ocon then signed with Renault, which led to him cutting most of his ties at Mercedes. </p>
<p> With that being said, perhaps both sides would want to rethink things if this scenario presents itself. Waiting in the wings without a ride for 2022 is Alpine Academy driver Oscar Piastri, who hasn’t not won a championship in four years. </p>
<p> The 2019 Formula Renault Eurocup champion, the 2020 Formula 3 champion and the 2021 Formula 2 champion somehow ended up not being picked up for 2022, but not many expect him to be without a seat again in 2023. </p>
<p> If Ocon were to be Mercedes’ target to replace Hamilton, perhaps Alpine would be more willing to let him walk given that they have an easy way to replace him. </p>
<p> Let’s face it; if all of this unfolds as described, Piastri could easily get away from Alpine if they don’t approve Ocon to Mercedes. Ocon is under contract through 2024, and while Fernando Alonso is now the oldest driver on the grid at the age of 40, he has said that he hopes to race beyond when his contract ends this upcoming season. </p>
<p> Where does Piastri fit in for next year, if not Alpine? </p>
<p> Somewhere else, surely; there are only 10 drivers under contract for 2023 as it is, and he has already established himself as one of the top free agents on the market. </p>
<p> So with Piastri waiting in the wings, it seems far more likely now than it did several months ago that Alpine would be willing to part with Ocon if Mercedes make the right offer. Of course, the simplest solution would simply be Hamilton returning, as he is under contract to do. If that happens, the rest of the grid is set as well. </p>

<p> Formula 1: Toto Wolff reveals latest Lewis Hamilton hold-up </p>
<p> Toto Wolff revealed the latest hold-up in the contract negotiations between Mercedes and Lewis Hamilton for the 2021 Formula 1 season. </p>
<p> We are nearing the start of February, the final remaining full month of the offseason between the 2020 and 2021 Formula 1 seasons, and there are still only 19 drivers under contract for the upcoming season. </p>
<p> Seven-time/four-time reigning world champion Lewis Hamilton is still without a deal to compete in 2021, and he has not officially been a member of the team since his previous contract expired on Friday, January 1. </p>
<p> Multiple recent reports suggest that he and Mercedes are quite far apart when it comes to what they want from each other in a new deal. However, team principal Toto Wolff is still showing no concerns about the hold-up. </p>
<p> Before the 2020 season was originally scheduled to get underway in mid-March, it appeared as though a new contract between Hamilton and Mercedes was only a formality, with Hamilton even criticizing those who suggested there was any sort of rift between the two. </p>
<p> The fact that there still hasn’t been a deal signed, however, has only further heated up the rumors that the 36-year-old Briton may not be back with the team for what would be a ninth consecutive season in 2021. </p>
<p> The two sides have said on multiple occasions, specifically after Bottas signed his new deal, that there simply hasn’t been time to get a deal done, but we are now almost halfway through the offseason. </p>
<p> So what’s the hold-up? </p>
<p> According to Wolff, part of it stems from him having not been “in action” recently after testing positive for COVID-19, something he hadn’t previously revealed publicly. </p>
<p> “We know we want to race together. And now we have to negotiate the contract. … We had planned to be here [at last weekend’s Kitzbuhel downhill ski race] for a few days. And out of nowhere I got a positive corona test. Now we’ve just been here for 10 days. But everything’s fine. No symptoms, thank God. It could have gone badly, but we’re out of quarantine.” </p>
<p> Bahrain International Circuit is scheduled to host both preseason testing and the 2021 season opener, the Bahrain Grand Prix. Preseason testing is scheduled to take place from Friday, March 12 to Sunday, March 14, and the season is scheduled to get underway on Sunday, March 28. </p>

<p> “Geez he would be a good fit”: Gilchrist names ideal next job for Langer </p>
<p> “It would be intriguing to see what could grow and develop and sprout from that.” </p>
<p> Former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist has endorsed Justin Langer as a "good fit" to take over as coach of England for his next move. </p>
<p> Langer's well-documented resignation as coach of Australia has quickly sparked speculation as to where the 105-time Australian Test representative will land next. </p>
<p> The 51-year-old has gained reported interest across the globe, with Sri Lanka among the latest keen suitors set to contend for Langer's services, which are set to be on offer as early as next summer. </p>
<p> Recently speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Langer's manager James Henderson stated that his client will be back in the frame within the next 12 months. </p>
<p> “There’s a lot of interest in Justin’s availability from all around the world. We’ve received a lot of approaches inside and outside the game,” Henderson said. </p>
<p> “I’m sure Justin Langer won’t be unemployed next summer.” </p>
<p> After amassing a maiden T20 World Cup title and a 4-0 Ashes series win in recent months, Langer's tenure with Australia was littered with success. </p>
<p> His signature would be hard to ignore, namely for nations currently without a senior coach. </p>
<p> England's interim managing director Andrew Strauss has previously hinted that Langer could be in consideration to succeed Craig Silverwood, who was released of his duties on the eve of Langer's resignation earlier this month. </p>
<p> Trading Australia for England would be an entertaining thought for Langer following the messy exit that led to his departure. And while the Western Australian would be a coveted coach for the Poms, Gilchrist is of the belief England may need to tread water before moving for Langer. </p>
<p> “I get the feeling that doing it straight away... it just might be a bit soon,” Gilchrist told The Shackles Are Off podcast. “He’s been hurt — you don’t need to be Einstein to work that out. </p>
<p> “I don’t think he’s going to be short of opportunities, so he needs to work that out. </p>
<p> “I don’t say this in a provocative sense, but I do look at the set up at the moment with England and think, ‘geez he would be a good fit’. </p>
<p> “It would be intriguing to see what could grow and develop and sprout from that. </p>
<p> “And Joe (Root) as captain I think would benefit from a figure like Justin alongside him." </p>
<p> Australia are yet to appoint a senior coach to take over from Langer, with assistant Andrew McDonald currently undertaking interim duties ahead of next month's tour of Pakistan. </p>

<p> World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler will make his RBC Canadian Open debut this June. Scheffler is on an impressive hot streak on the PGA Tour, winning the World Golf Championships-Dell Technologies Match Play on Sunday with a 4 & 3 victory over Kevin Kisner in the finale. </p>
<p> Scottie Scheffler is the hottest player in golf and now has the ranking to prove it. Six weeks after his first PGA Tour victory, Scheffler won the Dell Technologies Match Play for his third title in his last five starts, this one enough to move him to No. 1 in the world. </p>
<p> Atthaya Thitikul won the JTBC Classic on Sunday for her first LPGA Tour title, three-putting for bogey on the second hole of a playoff to outlast Nanna Koerstz Madsen. </p>

<p> Nanna Koerstz Madsen was tied for the lead in the JTBC Classic when she teed off Saturday on the par-4 18th. She two-putted for par and a 3-under 69 — and walked off with an unexpected three-stroke lead over Na Rin An. </p>
<p> Ben Martin shot a 2-under 70 on Saturday to hold onto a two-shot lead in the PGA Tour’s Corales Puntacana Championship. </p>

Kisner added to his record of most matches won since the move to Austin Country Club in 2016 when he poured in three birdies over the last four holes and rallied from 2 down on the back nine to beat Luke List on the final hole. </p>
<p> Who will we see back in action first - Tiger Woods or Phil Mickelson? Could a half-speed Bryson DeChambeau actually be better suited for Augusta than full speed? Is Rory McIlroy showing anything to believe this could be the year he finally wins the Masters? TSN Golf analyst Bob Weeks answers these questions and more in Speed Golf. </p>
<p> Ben Martin birdied six of the last eight holes for a 6-under 66 and the first-round lead Thursday in the PGA Tour's windy Corales Puntacana Championship. </p>
<p> Pablo Larrazábal followed a simple formula of drinking water and making birdies on Thursday at the Qatar Masters, opening a two-stroke lead after the first round. </p>
<p> Golf's most fickle tournament delivered its usual dose of oddities Wednesday in the Dell Technologies Match Play, including the fortunes of Maverick McNealy. The last man to get in the 64-man field, he was the first to close out his match. </p>
<p> Bryson DeChambeau has been away from competitive golf for nearly two months because he was recovering from a fractured hamate bone in his left hand and a torn labrum in his left hip. </p>
<p> Phil Mickelson will not be playing the Masters this year, according to the tournament’s web site. On Monday, the three-time winner was listed among the past champions who won’t be competing, Bob Weeks writes. </p>

<p> The Korda Family Slam: A Legendary Feat That Might Never Be Achieved in Sport Again </p>
<p> Nelly Korda comes from a family with a deep background in the world of sports. Her father, Petr Korda, was a big star in the world of tennis. His 21-year-old son Sebastian stepped into his shoes and is currently sending ripples through the sport. Her sister, Jessica, much like Nelly herself, is a decorated golfer who plays on the LPGA Tour, one of the best that the country has produced. </p>
<p> However, even though the success of the family needs no more explaining, they boast of a crazy record legacy that they have established. All the four athletes of the family have, in Australia, bagged the highest level title in their sport. Their father, Petr, started it all with his first and last grand slam title that he won in 1998 at the Australian Open. </p>
<p> Subsequently, Jessica, in her quest for her first title on the LPGA tour, won the Women’s Australian Open in 2012. She won in a stunning 6 side playoff battle, paving the way for her younger siblings to follow suit. In 2018, Sebastian snagged the Australian Open boys title, his junior first grand slam victory, a real step forward in his career. </p>
<p> When Nelly Korda clinched the title to complete a family grand slam </p>
<p> In 2019, Nelly played at the ISPS Handa Women’s Australian Open, with no doubt a double agenda on her plate. Moreover, she lived up to the expectations of her family, securing a second title for herself in addition to completing the family Australian grand slam. She finished with a 17-under total of 271, after leading the field since the third day. Defending champion Jin Young Ko finished second, despite playing a final round 64. </p>
<p> .@NellyKorda joins her father Petr, her sister @Thejessicakorda and brother @SebiKorda as Australian Open champions and joins the scissor kick tradition! </p>
<p> Her celebration, of course, would have been incomplete without the trademark scissor-kick jump with the trophy! All four of them have a lovely picture in the pose, unique to wins in Australia, no doubt making for a great memory picture for one of the most celebrated sports families in the world! </p>
<p> After winning the second title of her career, where she achieved this spectacular feat, she admitted, “I was playing all day for my parents. I’m really proud of that.” Revealing her father’s reaction, she said, “He’s like, ‘Well, congratulations, you’re part of the Korda’s clan now’ So, that was funny.” Jessica, ecstatic, congratulated Nelly over the phone by saying, “Welcome to the club!” Sebastian, too, shared the joyous sentiments, as she also revealed. </p>
<p> Nevertheless, with many more years left for the three siblings, what do you think the future holds for them? Let us know your thoughts in the comments! </p>

<p> Hamstrung Roo in doubt for Round 1 after intraclub injury </p>
<p> North could be without star Aaron Hall heading into the season. </p>
<p> North veteran Aaron Hall is in doubt for North Melbourne's opening round clash against Hawthorn after scans revealed the defender sustained a hamstring injury during last week's intraclub match. </p>
<p> Hall was sidelined during the second quarter of the Arden Street match after leaving the ground with a soft tissue complaint. Hall is expected to miss around three to four weeks, ruling him out of both pre-season matches against Melbourne and Sydney, and putting him in serious doubt for North's Round 1 outing on March 20. </p>
<p> A change of position in 2021 to the defensive half revitalised Hall's game after earlier seasons at Gold Coast where he made his name as a speedy half-forward. In a career-best season for the 31-year-old, Hall averaged 27.9 disposals and 650.5 metres gained per game. </p>
<p> Hall wasn't the only Kangaroo to be sidelined during the hitout, with teammates Luke McDonald and Tristan Xerri both sidelined in the first quarter after suffering concussions. The two will miss North's first practice match against Melbourne on Thursday, but are expected to return for the AAMI Community Series match against Sydney on March 6. </p>
<p> Miss any of tonight's intraclub game? </p>
<p> We've got you covered with an extended highlights package of the game. 👊 </p>
<p> Meanwhile, veteran Ben Cunnington has no firm date on his return to the game as he recovers from undergoing chemotherapy, while Jed Anderson has reportedly been given a deadline by the club to receive his second Covid-19 vaccine ahead of the season getting underway. </p>
<p> North Melbourne's 2021 campaign gets underway against the Hawks on March 20 at the MCG. </p>

<p> If Kiwis come knocking, Australian rugby must take what it can get </p>
<p> It’s clear after two rounds of Super Rugby AU that playing stocks are thin, so Australian rugby should accept any invitation from New Zealand and be thankful </p>
<p> If New Zealand offers Australia two or three places in a Trans-Tasman Super Rugby competition, Australian administrators should grab the opportunity with both hands. </p>
<p> There has been speculation New Zealand only wants limited Australian participation in any future competition involving the two countries because of concerns Australia is incapable of supporting any more than three teams. </p>
<p> Rugby Australia chairman Hamish McLennan described New Zealand’s attitude as a “master-servant” mentality, but it’s time Australian rugby faces up to some harsh realities about the game in this country. After two rounds of Super Rugby AU it is abundantly clear Australia lacks the depth of playing talent to support five – or maybe even four – teams. </p>
<p> This problem will be exacerbated if RA fails to secure a lucrative new broadcast deal and more quality Australian players head overseas at the end of the year. </p>
<p> One of the main reasons Australian rugby got itself into so much trouble on and off the field was because of ambitious expansion into AFL-dominated states, Western Australia and Victoria, at a time when Australian playing resources were being depleted by rich clubs in Europe and Japan. </p>
<p> The two heartland states of NSW and Queensland produce the vast majority of professional Australian rugby players between them, heavily populating the Brumbies, Western Force and Melbourne Rebels in Super Rugby. With the exodus overseas, NSW and Queensland are also producing players for English Premiership Rugby, the French Top 14 and the Japanese Top League. </p>
<p> No wonder the Reds and the Waratahs look like shadows of the teams that won the Super Rugby title in 2011 and 2014 respectively. </p>
<p> In an ideal world it would be wonderful to have Super Rugby franchises in five Australian cities across the continent, but this country simply does not have the players to support that many sides and remain competitive. </p>
<p> Australia does not need five teams to be successful. Only two provincial teams – NSW and Queensland – supplied players to the Wallabies team that won the 1991 World Cup and just three Super Rugby franchises – Waratahs, Reds and Brumbies – made up the 1999 World Cup-winning Wallabies squad. </p>
<p> Fewer Australian teams would help Australia retain talented players and provide stronger, more attractive Super Rugby sides for fans, albeit in fewer markets. But until the so-called minor states begin to mass produce professional-standard players there should be a question mark over their participation in any future Super Rugby competition; simply, there aren’t enough players in Sydney and Brisbane to go around. </p>
<p> There has to be a place for Victoria and Western Australia in the Australian rugby landscape, but is it necessarily in Super Rugby? Maintaining five Super Rugby teams would require a radical rethink as to how to populate franchises in traditional non-rugby states. </p>
<p> It would be disastrous for Australian rugby if the Force raided the east coast as it did when it was founded in 2005 or if the Rebels spent a small fortune on both domestic and foreign players again as they did in 2011. </p>
<p> If the Force and the Rebels want to stay in Super Rugby, they may have to accept becoming development projects supported by long-term growth strategies rather than trying to buy instant success. </p>
<p> But that may not suit New Zealand’s objectives. Former All Blacks coach Steve Hansen’s claim that New Zealand owes Australia nothing is largely irrelevant. New Zealand will do what is best for New Zealand, which effectively means what is best for the All Blacks. </p>
<p> New Zealand will seek the best possible provincial competition to prepare Kiwi players for Test rugby. That is what it is all about over there. </p>
<p> Australia must do the same. Perhaps Rugby Australia believes having more teams will translate into a more valuable broadcast deal, but that would be a false economy. If Australian rugby continues to offer mediocre product, rugby fans will continue to switch off, which would devalue the sport. </p>
<p> There has been talk of Australia going it alone if New Zealand does not accept four or five Australian teams in a Trans-Tasman competition, but this would be foolhardy. </p>
<p> A five-team Australian Super Rugby competition would be economically unsustainable. RA could always partner with Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest’s Global Rapid Rugby to provide more content, but that would not meet high-performance requirements. </p>
<p> Australia needs to maintain a close connection with Kiwi rugby to develop Test players. Before Super Rugby, the close ties forged by NSW and Queensland with New Zealand provinces helped to raise the standard of Australian rugby to the point where the Wallabies won Bledisloe Cups, Grand Slams and World Cups. </p>
<p> Severing that Kiwi bond at the provincial level would see Australian standards fall even further than what they are now and that would be catastrophic. Australian rugby should accept any invitation to play it receives from New Zealand and be thankful. </p>

<p> Boxing News </p>
<p> EXCLUSIVE BY JEFF POWELL: A mega-million-dollars deal to move Joshua's bid to regain his WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO titles away from London was reached in principal at Middle East time on Sunday night, with June 25 earmarked as the most likely date. Agreement came as the Formula 1 circus was in the last stages of packing up to move out of Jeddah after Sunday's Grand Prix went ahead despite a massive rocket attack on a Saudi oil installation just 12 miles from the track. Joshua fought there in December 2019 (inset left), in a similar rematch against Andy Ruiz who had inflicted AJ's first defeat and first loss of his titles. The return clash with Usyk (right and inset right, defending Ukraine from Russia's invasion) had looked to be heading back to London, at either the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where AJ was thrashed in their first fight, or Wembley Stadium. </p>
<p> The Gypsy King will put his WBC heavyweight title on the line against Whyte (right) at Wembley on April 23, in what he is claiming will be his last ever fight. Fury (left) is already hard at work training for the fight and has come off social media in the build-up to the blockbuster bout out of respect for fellow Brit Whyte. But while Fury is giving the fight his full undivided attention, Steward (inset) has revealed that the 33-year-old will not be giving any sort of game plan a second's thought until he's lacing up his gloves at Wembley. </p>

<p> A section of Three Lions fans jeered Harry Maguire's name when it was read out ahead of the game at Wembley and greeted his first few touches in similar fashion. Gareth Southgate, who was forced to defend the Manchester United captain before the match amid widespread criticism of his club form, slammed the reception the defender received as an 'absolute joke'. But Keane, who was in the ITV studio for Tuesday's match, criticised Southgate for his response, claiming the England boss had 'made it a bigger story than it is'. </p>
<p> Mohamed Salah had to be escorted off the pitch by security guards after he was targeted by Senegal fans in the aftermath of their decisive World Cup qualifying win over Egypt. The Liverpool forward was initially confronted by a Senegal fan as they invaded the pitch to celebrate at full-time but security guards managed to brush him aside. But as Salah made his way towards the tunnel, he was then targeted with several objects thrown from above in the stands at the Diamniadio Olympic Stadium in Dakar. </p>
<p> Ukrainian left-back Mykolenko told UA Tribuna that Dutch midfield star van de Beek, on loan from Manchester United, said he would pay to rent a house for those displaced by the conflict. </p>
<p> While many Premier League clubs were against re-implementing the rule, there is a high confidence that there is enough support for it finally to be brought back, according to The Times. </p>
<p> With various countries battling it out for a spot at the World Cup in Qatar later this year, excitement is building. Here, Sportsmail has compiled a handy draw guide. </p>
<p> Italy missed out on a second successive World Cup after losing to North Macedonia. The result came as a shock to many. Bonucci called Italy's omission from the World Cup 'absolute madness'. </p>
<p> It is the 14th successive ball that Adidas has created for the FIFA World Cup and is designed to support peak game speeds, as it travels faster in flight than any ball in the tournament's history. The 'Al Rihla' takes its name from the Arabic word for 'the journey' and is inspired by the architecture, boats, and flag of host nation Qatar. The ball has been designed from the inside out using data and rigorous testing at adidas labs, in wind tunnels and on the pitch by football players themselves. Al Rihla is expected to provide the highest levels of accuracy and reliability on the field of play, partly due to its new panel shape and surface textures. </p>
<p> NEW Jaap Stam could return to the Manchester United fold in a coaching capacity. He has said he would 'without a doubt' accept a coaching role at Old Trafford. Stam is eager to help the club rediscover its form. </p>
<p> NEW Dynamo were due to face Sporting at the beginning of March, but saw their match postponed as war began in their homeland. They will now face each other in Bucharest on April 7. </p>
<p> The German striker recently admitted he feels more comfortable representing his country after enduring a difficult career with Chelsea, who he joined in the summer of 2020. </p>
<p> Jack Grealish says he is extremely impressed with Jude Bellingham's technical ability. The Manchester City star went on to say that he was 'nowhere near as good' when he was 18 years old. </p>
<p> Harry Maguire has ignored the England fans who booed him during the friendly with Ivory Coast by tweeting about his 'enjoyable week playing for my country.' A section of the Wembley crowd jeered the Manchester United defender both before and during England's 3-0 win on Tuesday night. It led to a furious Gareth Southgate slamming the booing as an 'absolute joke' and team-mates Jordan Henderson and Declan Rice backing Maguire on social media. </p>
<p> Egypt star Salah missed a spot-kick after being targeted with dozens of lasers and was pelted with objects by opposition fans in his side's crucial World Cup qualifying play-off against Senegal. </p>
<p> According to Fresh Air Festival , the event will host the Red Devils against the Reds in Bangkok on July 12, less than a month before the Premier League season is set to start on August 6. </p>
<p> The Uruguayan has taken the Primeira Liga by storm for Benfica and his performances this season have caught the eye of several clubs, with Arsenal also thought to be interested in the player. </p>
<p> Uruguay booked their spot in Qatar as a 2-0 win over Chile saw them clinch automatic World Cup qualification on Tuesday but Cavani's game was cut short as he was forced to leave the pitch. </p>
<p> Mohamed Salah was targeted with dozens of lasers shone in his face before blazing over a penalty in the shootout in Egypt's crucial World Cup qualifier defeat by Senegal. The Pharaohs went into the second leg of the play-off 1-0 up but Hamdi Fathi's own goal after just four minutes on Tuesday restored parity in the tie. Their misery was compounded after they lost a second consecutive penalty shootout to Senegal - who qualified for the tournament in Qatar - with the defeat in Diamniadio coming after their AFCON heartbreak earlier this year. But the game was overshadowed by Egypt's players having to put up with being targeted by lasers from the home supporters, which came to a head when Salah, stepping up in the shootout, had to try and focus amid the distractions. </p>
<p> interested parties have told Sportsmail that doing a deal for the ground is a major sticking point in any arrangement to take over the stricken Rams, and for some it forced them to walk away. </p>
<p> The Spanish giants confirmed the news in a statement on Wednesday and it comes as a blow for Madrid as they gear up for a Champions League clash against Chelsea next week. </p>
<p> The Holland international has shone on international duty with Louis van Gaal's side - scoring twice against Denmark before netting in the draw with Germany. He has rarely played for Spurs of late. </p>
<p> The Dutchman is among the favourites alongside PSG boss Mauricio Pochettino to replace interim head coach Ralf Rangnick in the Old Trafford hot seat this summer. </p>
<p> IAN HERBERT: Van Gaal was not the only one dismayed by Old Trafford obsession with commercial deals. His players were so affronted by being asked to do a sponsors' event after one match they withdrew cooperation, forcing executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward to seek a truce with dressing-room leader Ashley Young. Woodward has been replaced by Richard Arnold and a greater common sense is restored, though Van Gaal is not wrong to suggest that the United job is, in some ways, a poisoned chalice. There are therefore a number of reasons to ponder whether Ten Hag really is the right man for this job. Culturally, he is certainly a good fit for Manchester, hailing from the county of Twente, the former heart of the Dutch textile industry, in the far east of Holland. But this job seems to demand more than a workmanlike approach to the task in hand. </p>
<p> Superstar Ronaldo, who is enduring a chastening season at club level with Manchester United, will play at a fifth World Cup of his career later this year. </p>
<p> The former Real Madrid manager has now brought his short stint in charge to a close after only taking over the reins in September after not being able to guide Egypt to their fourth-ever World Cup. </p>
<p> ADRIAN KAJUMBA AT WEMBLEY: England's preparations for the World Cup later this year were boosted by a convincing 3-0 friendly win over the Ivory Coast on Tuesday night. Ollie Watkins fired England ahead on 30 minutes before Raheem Sterling doubled their lead prior to the interval. In between this Ivory Coast captain Serge Aurier was sent off. Tyrone Mings completed the scoreline in second-half stoppage-time. Sportsmail's ADRIAN KAJUMBA was at Wembley to provide his player ratings. </p>
<p> A section of Three Lions fans jeered Maguire's name when it was read out ahead of England's Wembley win against 10-man Ivory Coast and greeted his first few touches in similar fashion. </p>
<p> SAMI MOKBEL: England supporters need a target: it just so happens that Harry Maguire's in their crosshairs.That's life for the under pressure Manchester United captain right now. </p>
<p> ENGLAND 3-0 IVORY COAST - IAN LADYMAN AT WEMBLEY STADIUM: The look on Jack Grealish's face as the referee prepared to send off Serge Aurier just before half-time told the story. </p>
<p> Jack Grealish, who dazzled for Gareth Southgate's side on Tuesday night, has now confirmed just why he was so irritated with the referee when Aurier was shown a red card in the first half. </p>
<p> The 24-year-old was omitted from the Three Lions squad that recorded victories at Wembley against Switzerland on Saturday and against Ivory Coast on Tuesday night. </p>
<p> The Borussia Dortmund midfielder impressed on his 12th senior Three Lions appearance to win the man of the match award with a composed display against Ivory Coast. </p>
<p> PORTUGAL 2-0 NORTH MACEDONIA - MATT BARLOW IN PORTO: Cristiano Ronaldo and his lavishly gifted supporting cast decreed that enough was enough and North Macedonia's unlikely flirtation with the World Cup would end here, on party night in Porto. This was always billed as Ronaldo's show, his triumphant procession to a fifth World Cup towards the end of a truly glorious career, and two goals from his Manchester United team-mate Bruno Fernandes ensured it went to plan. Portugal, for decade a nation with only fleeting moments of footballing success to savour, have not failed to reach a major tournament since his debut in 2003. </p>
<p> A consequence of the pandemic means Everton were only able to recoup £200,000 in gate receipts last season - three Premier League fixtures, played in front of limited crowds. </p>
<p> Ibrahimovic came off the bench in the 79th minute but he could not turn the tide for his country as goals from Robert Lewandowski and Piotr Zielinski saw the Poles book their place in Qatar. </p>
<p> It wasn't always straightforward, but even in the hardest moments Luis Suarez didn't doubt that Uruguay would qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. </p>
<p> Peru will meet either the United Arab Emirates or Australia, who play the Asian confederation playoff in Doha on June 7, for a place in Qatar. The playoff will take place in Doha on June 13 or 14. </p>
<p> Police were forced to use tear gas to diffuse violent clashes with supporters after angry Nigeria fans stormed the pitch following a 1-1 draw with Ghana. A packed out Abuja National Stadium in Nigeria quickly turned sour when the final whistle and it was confirmed that Ghana had progressed on away goals, ending Nigeria's hopes of reaching the World Cup in Qatar later this year. Fans flooded onto the pitch and the surrounding pitchside areas to show their annoyance at a failed qualification campaign. Those supporters who stayed in the stands watched in disbelief as dugouts were ripped from the ground and various items were launched at players from both sides as they tried to race down the tunnel to take refuge in the dressing rooms. </p>
<p> AFRICAN QUALIFYING ROUND-UP: Sadio Mane delivered the winning spot kick as Senegal edged Egypt 3-1 on penalties at the end of a tempestuous World Cup playoff second leg in Dakar on Tuesday. </p>
<p> In their winner-takes-all play-off, it was the Poles who came out on top 2-0 thanks to a Robert Lewandowski penalty after the interval which was then followed up by a Piotr Zielinski strike. </p>
<p> Here were the reasons why Scotland can qualify for Qatar 2022 and also why they may not. Cruising to a 2-0 victory that would have made it seven wins from eight unbeaten matches. </p>
<p> Both countries were eliminated from the tournament in Qatar after suffering defeats in their playoff semi-finals last week which, had they won, would have pitted them against each other. </p>
<p> Christian Eriksen has continued his remarkable return to football by netting his second goal in three days for Denmark - scoring against Serbia in Copenhagen, the scene of his horrifying cardiac arrest at Euro 2020 last summer. Eriksen's collapse in the opening game of the tournament stunned the world last year, but he recovered before having an ICD heart starting device fitted - with doctors confident he was fit to return to the professional game. The playmaker was released by Inter Milan due to strict laws forbidding players who have such devices, and Brentford decided to give him a contract until the end of the season. His vibrant start to life in west London was rewarded with an emotional call-up to the Denmark squad once again and he duly scored in his first game back against Holland on Saturday. </p>
<p> France extended their winning run to seven matches as two-goal Kylian Mbappe and record-chasing Olivier Giroud struck in a 5-0 victory against South Africa. </p>
<p> It was also a special night for Wayne Hennessey who became the third Welshman to win 100 caps after Chris Gunter and Gareth Bale. </p>
<p> EXCLUSIVE BY SIMON JONES: Barcelona have contacted the agent of winger Ousmane Dembele to open discussions over a new contract, which could have consequences for their bid to sign Raphinha. </p>
<p> ADRIAN KAJUMBA AT WEMBLEY: Wilfried Zaha was forced to sit out Ivory Coast's Wembley friendly with England after suffering a grade two hamstring injury. </p>
<p> EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW BY DAVID COVERDALE: The sign above his front door reads 'Nobody gets out sober' and Eddie Gray has had every reason to enjoy a drink of late. The first cause for celebration came with Leeds' 94th-minute victory against Norwich, when Gray was housebound because of Covid but went 'crazy' in his living room instead. Then it was that stoppage-time comeback win over Wolves, which had the 74-year-old 'jumping up and down' in the directors' box at Molineux. 'That passion never leaves you,' the Leeds legend tells Sportsmail from his home in the picturesque village of Kirkby Overblow near Harrogate. 'It was such an important moment for our position in the league. </p>
<p> EXCLUSIVE: Ashworth resigned as Brighton's technical director in February - he has since been on gardening leave - and talks over his release to begin work at St James' Park are continuing. </p>
<p> Queiroz, who said she felt abused and harassed by the incident, has spent this season on loan at Levante. She alleges that the club forced her to isolate in February last year. </p>
<p> Chelsea's first black player, Paul Canoville, has become an influential figure in the club's takeover, with the former winger having met with controversial bidder Tom Ricketts last week. </p>
<p> Chelsea have released detailed information to fans who are allowed to buy tickets again after the government amended the club's licence. Fans have been updated over the next few games. </p>
<p> Joe Hart has revealed how a brutal critique of his abilities by Tottenham manager Nuno Espirito Santo left him considering retirement. The former England No 1 goalkeeper, 34, started the season with Spurs but was left 'buried' by the Portuguese boss, who told him he wouldn't play a single minute more for the club. Hart sealed a move to Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic shortly afterwards and has established himself as their first choice under coach Ange Postecoglou. </p>
<p> England Women boss Sarina Wiegman says she will give Steph Houghton as much time as possible to make her squad for the Euros. </p>
<p> The takeover battle at Chelsea is set to heat up in the coming weeks and the bidders have been advised on their conduct by the merchant bank which is advising the club with the sale. </p>
<p> The word that head coach Lee Carsley repeated over and over heading into this game was 'ruthless' and he got that from England's Under 21s in a second-half stroll in Albania. </p>
<p> Northern Ireland had looked the more dangerous side with captain Steven Davis hitting the outside of the post and McGinn himself going close, but they could not find a response. </p>
<p> Nunez is set to move on in the next window, and his 26 goals from 33 appearances this term have sparked a bidding war which includes struggling United. The Red Devils, who remain on the hunt for a permanent manager, will have to claw themselves back into the top four if they are to have any hope of recruiting the ace. The Telegraph have reported that Benfica are eager to clear up the future of the forward as soon as possible, and they are expected to bank a sizeable figure for him. Having dazzled in the Champions League this year, the 22-year-old Nunez is unsurprisingly keen to continue plying his trade in the competition next season. He scored twice against Barcelona in the group stage and netted the winner against Ajax earlier this month, underlining his status as one of the world's top prospects. </p>

<p> Tennis World No 5 Stefanos Tsitsipas (left) has waded into the sport's gender debate as he claimed women should play five sets if they want equal pay. The Greek star raised eyebrows with his comments at the Miami Open this week after he beat Alex De Minaur 6-4 6-3 to progress to the last 16. Tsitsipas said he had been told that women have better endurance than men so could therefore play five sets. The 23-year-old also argued that there would be more variety among male Grand Slam winners if they played three sets. Naomi Osaka (inset right) responded to the controversial comments after powering past Alison Riske 6-3 6-4 in the last 16, as she branded Tsitsipas a 'funny' guy. </p>

<p> You don't get to the top without having some sort of ruthless streak and Formula One world champion Max Verstappen has pulled no punches in that regard over the years. The Dutchman won his first world title after seeing off seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton last term via six seasons in the sport where he appears to have verbally abused much of his rivals, his engine and even stewards on his way to achieving a lifelong dream. Yet, Verstappen's frustrations over his rival Charles Leclerc's driving including him supposedly breaching regulations during the Red Bull star's win at Sunday's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix even led to his own team telling him to 'keep your head down'. With that in mind, Sportsmail looks at other hot-headed outbursts from the Dutchman over the course of his Formula One career.

She said she was battling with psychological problems that threatened to overwhelm her before some words of encouragement and advice from the late cricket great got her past her lows. Her siblings Jackson and Brooke also spoke at the service, which culminated with the unveiling of his name on the re-named Shane Warne stand at the famous venue. The memorial was attended by a Warne's family, close friends, former Australia teammates, Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his friends from the entertainment worlds.

Suarez scored on the night, along with Federico Valverde. And as attention turned firmly to the tournament itself Suarez's representative, Martin Rodriguez, shared a screenshot of a WhatsApp conversation with the striker back in November, with Uruguay languishing in seventh place in the South American qualifying table. </p>

<p> SAMI MOKBEL: You hope Harry Maguire's got a thick skin. If not, then this might take some getting over for the embattled England defender. In truth, there were actually a few boos here at Wembley on Saturday afternoon when Maguire's name was read out on the PA system as England prepared to face Switzerland. It went largely under the radar at the time; there was only really a smattering of jeers - and even so, it happened well in advance of kick-off in front of a half-empty stadium. </p>
<p> Norris signed a new and improved long-term deal in February after a fine season which saw Norris finish sixth in the driver's standings and the team do well in the constructor's championship. </p>

<p> England's preparations for the World Cup later this year were boosted by a convincing 3-0 friendly win over the Ivory Coast on Tuesday night. Ollie Watkins fired England ahead on 30 minutes before Raheem Sterling doubled their lead before the interval. In between this Ivory Coast captain Serge Aurier was sent off.

<p> PORTUGAL 2-0 NORTH MACEDONIA - MATT BARLOW IN PORTO: Cristiano Ronaldo and his lavishly gifted supporting cast decreed that enough was enough and North Macedonia's unlikely flirtation with the World Cup would end here, on party night in Porto. This was always billed as Ronaldo's show, his triumphant procession to a fifth World Cup towards the end of a truly glorious career, and two goals from his Manchester United teammate Bruno Fernandes ensured it went to plan. Portugal, for decade a nation with only fleeting moments of footballing success to savour, have not failed to reach a major tournament since his debut in 2003. </p>

The Pharaohs went into the second leg of the play-off 1-0 up but Hamdi Fathi's own goal after just four minutes on Tuesday restored parity in the tie. Their misery was compounded after they lost a second consecutive penalty shootout to Senegal - who qualified for the tournament in Qatar - with the defeat in Diamniadio coming after their AFCON heartbreak earlier this year. But the game was overshadowed by Egypt's players having to put up with being targeted by lasers from the home supporters, which came to a head when Salah, stepping up in the shootout, had to try and focus amid the distractions. </p>
<p> Ibrahimovic came off the bench in the 79th minute but he could not turn the tide for his country as goals from Robert Lewandowski and Piotr Zielinski saw the Poles book their place in Qatar. </p>

<p> Christian Eriksen has continued his remarkable return to football by netting his second goal in three days for Denmark - scoring against Serbia in Copenhagen, the scene of his horrifying cardiac arrest at Euro 2020 last summer. Eriksen's collapse in the opening game of the tournament stunned the world last year, but he recovered before having an ICD heart starting device fitted - with doctors confident he was fit to return to the professional game. The playmaker was released by Inter Milan due to strict laws forbidding players who have such devices, and Brentford decided to give him a contract until the end of the season. His vibrant start to life in west London was rewarded with an emotional call-up to the Denmark squad once again and he duly scored in his first game back against Holland on Saturday. </p>
<p> Here were the reasons why Scotland can qualify for Qatar 2022 and also why they may not. Cruising to a 2-0 victory that would have made it seven wins from eight unbeaten matches. </p>
<p> Both countries were eliminated from the tournament in Qatar after suffering defeats in their playoff semi-finals last week which, had they won, would have pitted them against each other. </p>
<p> EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW BY DAVID COVERDALE: The sign above his front door reads 'Nobody gets out sober' and Eddie Gray has had every reason to enjoy a drink of late. The first cause for celebration came with Leeds' 94th-minute victory against Norwich, when Gray was housebound because of Covid but went 'crazy' in his living room instead. Then it was that stoppage-time comeback win over Wolves, which had the 74-year-old 'jumping up and down' in the directors' box at Molineux. 'That passion never leaves you,' the Leeds legend tells Sportsmail from his home in the picturesque village of Kirkby Overblow near Harrogate. 'It was such an important moment for our position in the league. </p>

<p> MIKE DICKSON IN MIAMI: Nick Kyrgios was lucky to escape disqualification on Tuesday night after launching repeated tirades at the umpire during his Miami Open defeat.

<p> That chastening night seven years ago in Belo Horizonte against Joachim Low's eventual world champions saw Brazil's hopes of a sixth World Cup crown crumble to the ground in spectacular fashion. Dunga was brought in to replace Luiz Felipe Scolari, a decision that appeared to make little sense given that his previous stint ended when the Selecao were knocked out of the 2010 World Cup at the quarter-final stage by the Netherlands.

<p> Indian women’s football team to play two international friendly matches </p>
<p> The Indian women's team will play two international friendly matches -- against Egypt and Jordan -- in April, the All India Football Federation said on Monday. </p>
<p> Indian women's football team is set to assemble for a seven-day training camp in Goa from March 28 to April 3. (AIFF) </p>
<p> The Indian women’s team will play two international friendly matches — against Egypt and Jordan — in April, the All India Football Federation said on Monday. </p>
<p> The matches will be played in Jordan on April 5 (against Egypt) and 8 (against Jordan). </p>
<p> “The senior women’s national team will be playing Egypt and Jordan in two friendly matches, both of which are to be played in Jordan from April 5-8, 2022,” the AIFF said in a release. </p>
<p> “The Blue Tigresses will thereafter, be joining their respective clubs for the upcoming Hero IWL season.” </p>

<p> Dennerby was with the national U-18 team which won the SAFF Championships in Jamshedpur last week. Astam Oraon, Apurna Narzary and Martina Thokchom of the U-18 side have joined the senior national camp. </p>
<p> The national side was forced to withdraw from the group stage of the AFC Asian Cup which India hosted in January-February after it failed to field a team due to COVID-19 outbreak inside its bio-bubble in Mumbai. </p>

<p> India Test juggernaut keeps home invincibility rolling on </p>
<p> Bengaluru: Much has changed in Indian cricket since the national team last lost a Test series on home soil nearly 10 years ago. </p>
<p> Former captain MS Dhoni retired from Test cricket, Virat Kohli took up the mantle to lead India to the top of the rankings before stepping down this year and four different coaches have been in charge of the team. </p>
<p> But India's relentless home domination continued. </p>
<p> They have hosted 42 matches since England claimed a famous 2-1 victory in 2012. The hosts have lost two Tests but won every series - 15 in a row after the 2-0 sweep of Sri Lanka. </p>
<p> read more </p>
<p> Several teams have come to Indian shores with high hopes of conquering the "final frontier". Australia, West Indies, South Africa, New Zealand and England have toured twice since 2012 and lost every series. </p>
<p> Bangladesh and Afghanistan were also thrashed while Sri Lanka have now gone 22 matches without a win in India - the most by any team in a country. </p>
<p> Many of India's victories have been achieved in emphatic fashion, often without having to bat a second time. </p>
<p> As a result, competition for places has become cut-throat and batting stalwarts such as Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, with 177 Test caps between them, have been dropped. </p>
<p> Against Sri Lanka, they were not missed. </p>
<p> A rapidly maturing Shreyas Iyer cemented his place in the middle order with two half-centuries on a Bengaluru pitch that aided the Lankan spinners and Hanuma Vihari showed promise at number three. </p>
<p> Big shoes </p>
<p> Dhoni's shoes were probably the biggest to fill but the daring Rishabh Pant has made the wicketkeeper's job his own. </p>
<p> Pant had proved his mettle overseas and in the past 14 months has contributed match-turning knocks lower down the order. </p>
<p> Lightning-quick glove work, sound judgement on reviewing decisions and fireworks with the bat contributed to a player of the series award against Sri Lanka. </p>
<p> Pant has had his critics, mainly for his propensity to throw his wicket away with rash decision-making. </p>
<p> But his skipper Rohit believes he has learned to play a delicate balancing act between trusting his instincts and curbing them. </p>
<p> "As a cricketer you want to evolve. In the past, I've made a few mistakes, but I want to keep improving. My mindset is not the same," Pant said. "I used to think too much about what I might miss. Now I'm focusing on my process." With India playing matches across all three formats throughout the year, squad rotation has been key to keeping players fresh - especially fast bowlers. </p>
<p> Jasprit Bumrah has played 29 Tests for India but the Bengaluru game - where he picked up eight wickets - was only his fourth at home. </p>
<p> "Keeping the workload in mind we have to rotate these bowlers, so he's missed a lot of games," Rohit said. </p>

<p> India vs Sri Lanka: Domestic toil pays off for Saurabh Kumar | Cricket News </p>
<p> MUMBAI: Uttar Pradesh left-arm spinner Saurabh Kumar, who was the only new face in the Indian team for the two-Test home series against Sri Lanka announced by chief selector Chetan Sharma on Saturday, has been on the radar of the national selectors for a while now due to his consistent performances on the domestic circuit. In 46 first-class games for Services and UP, Saurabh Kumar has taken 196 wickets @ 24.15, 16 five-wicket hauls, and six 10-wicket match hauls. In the 2018-19 season, the 28-year-old took 51 wickets in 10 games in the Ranji Trophy, and 19 in the Duleep Trophy. In Dec 2018, he took 14 for 65 against Haryana — the second-best match figures for a bowler for Uttar Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy. In the 2019-20 Ranji Trophy season, he took 44 wickets @21.09. The 28-year-old has also scored two first-class hundreds and eight fifties for an average of 29.11. Talking about giving a maiden India call-up to Saurabh Kumar, chairman o f s e l e c t o r s Chetan Sharma said, “Saurabh has been doing well in domestic cricket. We picked him from there and he went to South Africa with India ‘A.’ We are very happy with his performance. He was with the (Indian) team as a net bowler (against England in the Test series last January) and in South Africa also, he was also one of the standbys. Let us hope that he does well.” </p>

<doc id="file24155957" filename="jenson-button-predicts-lewis-hamilton-fightback" parent_folder="web1" url="https://www.planetf1.com/news/jenson-button-predicts-lewis-hamilton-fightback/">
<p> Button predicts Hamilton fightback in title battle </p>
<p> 2009 F1 World Champion Jenson Button feels Lewis Hamilton’s battle with Max Verstappen for the 2021 title is not over. </p>
<p> Hamilton started the season strong, but Verstappen has now very much taken control with three consecutive victories. </p>
<p> It means that heading into the British Grand Prix, Hamilton trails Verstappen in the Drivers’ standings by 32 points, and already some are starting to question whether or not the seven-time World Champion has a response. </p>
<p> Button is not one of those people though, instead he expects a fightback from Hamilton. </p>
<p> “That’s why this year is so exciting, we really don’t know,” he told Sky F1 when asked which way the title fight will go. </p>
<p> “Most of the years you get through three or four of the races and it’s ‘ah, it’s going to be a Mercedes Championship and probably going to be Lewis Hamilton’. </p>
<p> “Whereas this year he’s got a challenge on his hands, and I know that he is behind in the Championship at the moment to Max, but he will be fighting with him later in the year I have a feeling.” </p>
<p> Silverstone is a track which has served Mercedes well over the years, with the German outfit having won seven of the last nine races there. </p>
<p> And so Button expects this venue will also suit the W12, meaning we should be in for a good Hamilton/Verstappen battle. </p>
<p> “Silverstone is a circuit where their [Mercedes’] car should work pretty well, so it should be a really close fight with the Red Bull and Max Verstappen,” he said. </p>
<p> In the midst of this title scrap, Hamilton reaffirmed his commitment to Mercedes and to Formula 1 by signing a new two-year contract, a decision with Button believes was influenced by Verstappen’s challenge for the World Championship. </p>
<p> “I think Lewis is enjoying it, I think he is enjoying the fight with someone, and he knows how talented Max is, he knows how good Red Bull are,” Button explained. </p>
<p> “So I think it’s an exciting fight for him and that is what is keeping him interested in Formula 1, and probably why he has got this new contract for the next two years.” </p>

<p> Katie Price arrest: Documentary with son Harvey Price 'axed by BBC' </p>
<p> The BBC reportedly ditches a new documentary featuring Katie Price following her arrest on Tuesday. </p>
<p> The BBC has reportedly shelved plans for a new documentary following her son Harvey Price's move to an assisted learning facility. </p>
<p> The project was announced earlier this month as a follow-up to the acclaimed Katie Price: Harvey And Me, which documented the former glamour model's attempts to find a suitable school facility for her son, who is severely disabled. </p>
<p> Price was arrested on Tuesday morning following a car crash near her home in Sussex, after which she tested positive for cocaine and was also found to be twice over the legal alcohol limit. </p>
<p> Yesterday a court ordered that she seek treatment at rehab facility The Priory and deferred her sentencing until December 15, when she could be jailed. </p>
<p> "Katie had been preparing to start filming with Harvey for the new BBC documentary but it's been pulled," a source told The Sun. </p>
<p> "It would have covered Harvey's first term at his new school but without Katie able to commit there is no show. </p>
<p> "Katie understands of course and hopes there may be scope in the future to pick up where they left off. </p>
<p> "The BBC will want to wait to see what happens in the future before making any decisions about the show." </p>
<p> Production on a separate documentary following the renovation of her so-called "mucky mansion" has also been suspended by Channel 4. </p>

<p> Lewis Hamilton expresses sympathy for Sebastian Vettel after Hungarian GP disqualification </p>
<p> His newly-reclaimed world title lead may have increased as a result, but Lewis Hamilton expressed his disappointment that Sebastian Vettel lost out on second place at the Hungaroring; Aston Martin have until Thursday to submit any official appeal against fuel sample ruling </p>
<p> By James Galloway </p>
<p> Last Updated: 03/08/21 10:07am </p>
<p> Lewis Hamilton has said he feels "gutted" for Sebastian Vettel over the German's disqualification from second place in the Hungarian GP </p>
<p> Hamilton may have directly benefitted from the post-race exclusion, rising from third into Vettel's second and increasing his title lead over Max Verstappen by two additional points, but he expressed his sympathy for his long-time rival after a strong performance from the Aston Martin driver behind surprise victor Esteban Ocon in Sunday's remarkable race. </p>
<p> Posting on his Instagram story on Monday, Hamilton said: "I'm so gutted for Seb. It is always an honour to be on the podium with you and you deserved this result. </p>
<p> "What you are doing at your new team is amazing, keep fighting and pushing. See you on track soon." </p>
<p> Vettel's car was thrown out of the results late on Sunday night after the FIA's technical delegate was unable to take a sufficient fuel sample after the race. Only 0.3 litres of the mandated 1-litre sample were able to be pumped out of the car. </p>
<p> Aston Martin have lodged their intent to appeal the decision, having stated that they believe there should have still been 1.44 litres of fuel in the car which was unable to be taken out. </p>
<p> The publication by the FIA of the final race result late on Sunday night after the disqualification was confirmed initially caused confusion, with Vettel still being shown in second place in the classification and a note attached saying the result was provisional subject to the outcome of Aston Martin's appeal notice. </p>

<p> However, in a corrected version of the result published on Monday, Vettel was duly listed as DSQ with Hamilton second and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz third pending any Aston Martin appeal. </p>
<p> All the other finishing drivers behind the top three gained a position, including Red Bull's Verstappen who moved into ninth from 10th. However, the Dutchman only picked up one extra point for the place gain whereas Hamilton collected three more by going from third (15 points) to second (18). </p>
<p> It means Hamilton now leads the standings by the same slender eight-point margin that Verstappen himself held coming into Hungary. Verstappen had led the way for two months after claiming the title lead for the first time in his career by winning the Monaco Grand Prix on May 23. </p>

<p> Lewis Hamilton Sends Stern Warning To Rivals Ahead Of F1 2022 Season; 'Still At The Top' </p>
<p> Mercedes F1 racer Lewis Hamilton has sent a stern warning to his title rivals ahead of the F1 2022 season as he revealed that he's still at the top of his game. </p>
<p> Seven-time Drivers' Champion Lewis Hamilton has sent a stern warning to his title rivals ahead of the F1 2022 season as he revealed that he is still at the peak of his game despite losing the championship last season. In the F1 2021 season, the Mercedes driver lost to Red Bull Racing's Max Verstappen in a controversial fashion after the Dutchman passed him on the last lap of the Abu Dhabi GP following some contentious decisions from the race director Michael Masi. </p>
<p> Lewis Hamilton issues stern warning to F1 title rivals </p>
<p> On being asked if he was a more dangerous driver after the improvements he made to his pre-season preparations, Lewis Hamilton replied as per F1.com, "I would say so. Naturally, your body does age, you do fatigue as you get older, it is a slower recovery. But I wouldn’t necessarily say I’m too down in the slope; I still feel like I'm relatively at the top!" The Mercedes F1 driver went on to add how he believes he has found more efficient ways to train and stated that the years of experience he has in the sport and with the team will make him a top contender this year. </p>
<p> "I feel I am more efficient in how I train. I’m much more in tune with my body in terms of knowing when I can push and when I can’t push. When I am recovered and when I am not. How I am feeding my body in terms of fuelling it. I am way more into that than ever before, sleep, all these sorts of things. I’ve got all the experience over the years; I’ve got the great rapport of my team. We’ve been together 10 years so I think we probably have the strongest partnership I would say," explained the 37-year old. </p>

<p> — PETRONAS Motorsports (@PET_Motorsports) March 15, 2022 </p>
<p> Hamilton, who is chasing a record eighth F1 championship yet again this season, also added, "I don’t need to be doing sprints before I go out. I’ve tried all that stuff and it didn’t work for me. It just made me hot-headed, and I overreacted to certain things that I was experiencing. Just before the race, I’ve usually got some music in my mind that I’ve been listening to. I kind of switch off. I’ve been doing this for such a long time. I don’t need to overthink what I’m going to do. I’ve done all the studying and the preparation for it, now I will go and do what I do, what I’ve done my whole life, just go and have fun." </p>
<p> With the seven-time Drivers' Champion oozing with confidence, all his title rivals will be on high alert for the F1 2022 season. Hamilton seems determined to hit the ground running, beginning this weekend at the Bahrain GP. The Bahrain GP takes place this weekend from March 18-20. With the F1 2022 season to have new rules, it promises to be intriguing as ever as new teams could be seen competing for the title, unlike previous seasons, where Mercedes F1 dominated. </p>

<p> MARINES WIN GOLD AT INAUGURAL 7’S RUGBY CHAMPIONSHIP, END USAF’S 8-YEAR RUN </p>
<p> GLENDALE, CO (By Kenneth Polk, Armed Forces Sports) – The last time the Marines and Air Force faced each other in the championship match was the 2006 Armed Forces 15-aside Rugby Championship. Since then, the Marine Corps Rugby team placed last in three of five years with the last two years failing to reach at least the consolidation match. As the Armed Forces Championship format moved from 15-aside to 7’s, the fast and physical Devil Dogs would emerge as champions over the Air Force (33-31) at the inaugural 2012 Armed Forces Rugby 7’s Championship. </p>
<p> The Marines advanced to the championship match with help from the Army who came back from a 19-0 halftime deficit to tie Navy 24-24 in the final match of pool play. The Army-Navy tie gave the Marine Corps and Navy teams identical 2-1-1 records at the conclusion of pool play. With an earlier 21-17 Marine Corps victory over the Navy during pool play, the Devil Dogs had their ticket to the championship (based on the head-to-head tie breaker). </p>
<p> It took Air Force only 43 seconds to draw first blood in the championship match. SrA Marcus Satavu (Tyndall AFB) broke free and sprinted 50 yard for the first try. 2dLt Reed Fleming (U.S. Air Force Academy) dropped-kicked the conversion and gave the Air Force a 7-0 lead. The Marines evened the score on a short try by 1stLt Chuck Smith (NAS Whiting Field) and a conversion by 2ndLt Sean Rohr (NAS Corpus Christi) at the 4:06 mark. </p>
<p> It didn’t take Air Force long to regain the lead as Capt John Lockard (Vance AFB) went the distance on the ensuing kickoff. Fleming’s conversion put the Air Force ahead 14-7 at the 5:28 mark. A minute later, the Marines tied it up again when 1stLt Elliot Joses (NAS Corpus Christi) scored on a 45 yard try followed by Rohr’s conversion. Poor tackling on the part of the Marines enabled Lockard to score again on a 60 yard try. The missed conversion gave Air Force a 19-14 lead with 8:49 on the clock. </p>
<p> The Marines were not about to go away as Rohr scored a try at the 9:57 mark. The failed conversion tied the score again (19-19) at the half. </p>
<p> Air Force wasted no time as Capt Jeff Branham (Los Angeles AFB) scored the first try of the second half followed by Fleming’s conversion. The Boys in Blue had a 26-16 advantage at the 12:04 mark. </p>
<p> One again there was no stopping the Marines. SSgt Mark Terrell (Camp Pendleton, CA) scored a try and Rohr converted to tie the score 26-26 with 14:43 showing on the clock. The big break for the Marines came when Joses scored a 43 yard try off of an interception as Mr. Reliable Rohr booted the conversion forcing the Marines to gain the lead at 33-26. With 17:36 showing on the clock, Satavu’s try in the closing seconds put the Air Force within two, but the failed conversion gave the Marines a reason to celebrate their first ever Armed Forces Rugby gold medal, thus ending the Air Forces’ 8-year run as rugby champions.

<p> Masters 2022: Tiger Woods on field list amid speculation he may return at Augusta National </p>
<p> The five-time champion is still on the Masters field list with a week until practice rounds begin </p>
<p> It's almost April, which means it's time for a tradition unlike any other: determining whether Tiger Woods is going to tee it up at Augusta National for this year's Masters. This has unfortunately become a nearly annual event because of Woods' extensive late-career run of injuries, but there's a completely different focus on Woods this year. </p>
<p> From tracking private planes to rumors of Tiger shooting worst-ball scores in the mid-60s at his home course in Florida, there's nothing that hasn't been floated as a bellwether for prognosticating whether Woods was going to play in many of the last several Masters. And yet, because of his extremely private life, there is still no clear indication this time around about whether Tiger will in fact make his (latest) comeback starting with the 86th edition of an event he's now won five times. </p>
<p> It would be remarkable if Tiger played the Masters for myriad reasons. He hasn't teed it up at an Official World Golf Rankings event since the 2020 Masters, which took place in November of that year. Since then, he endured yet another surgery on his back as well as one of the more horrific car wrecks we've ever seen a modern athlete endure. </p>
<p> Woods more or less disappeared for most of 2021 before emerging from the shadows late in the year with a sleeve on his right leg and a driver in both hands. Tiger played the PNC Championship in December with his son, Charlie, and looked surprisingly lithe. </p>
<p> Asked if that meant a return to the PGA Tour was on deck, Woods repeatedly demurred and essentially voiced: I'll be back when I'm back. </p>
<p> He was again questioned about a possible return to the Masters by Jim Nantz at the 2022 Genesis Invitational at Riviera Country Club in February and deflected Nantz's questions so many times that, at one point, he added that Nantz needed to "slow down, turbo". The questions were not out of line, nor were they irrational. </p>
<p> Woods has made comebacks at Augusta National before, and given how good he looked at the PNC in December -- and how much time he had to get back into playing shape -- it's feasible that he could tee it up at the first major of the year. </p>
<p> Late last week, it was reported that the Big Cat was stirring once again. </p>
<p> Have heard from multiple people in South Florida that Tiger Woods has been out walking Medalist multiple times this week. Joey was also in town to walk. </p>
<p> This single report, of course, doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of the Masters or of Tiger's career. It does indicate, however, that a Masters comeback many didn't think was possible as recently as a month ago remains up in the air for the best to ever do it. </p>
<p> Greg DuCharme -- who used to work at Medalist, where Tiger plays -- confirmed on the First Cut podcast Sunday, that Tiger only walks Medalist (specifically with caddie Joe LaCava) when he's preparing for something meaningful, which leads me to believe that regardless of whether Tiger plays this year's Masters, he's at the very least considering it. </p>
<p> We likely won't know the end result here until the beginning of Masters week, which means the next seven days are going to teem with rumors upon rumors upon rumors. That will be exhausting, but if the payoff is that a 15-time major winner plays professional golf for the first time in 18 months just over a year after nearly losing one of his limbs, then perhaps the payoff will be worth it. </p>
<p> Tiger Woods has been spotted walking Medalist with Joe LaCava on the bag. @therealGFD thinks that means we will see Cat playing Augusta next week 🐯🌸 </p>
<p> What's flabbergasting is going back to May 2021 and trying to explain to anyone listening that Phil Mickelson, who had just stunningly won the PGA Championship, was not going to play in the 2022 Masters but Tiger, who we hadn't seen in several months and may or may not have been in a wheelchair at the time, actually might. </p>
<p> Mickelson's name was removed from the field list, and a source confirmed to CBS Sports that he will officially not play in the event. Tiger's name is still listed for now, although that could obviously change up until the Thursday morning when the tournament starts. Either way, he will almost certainly be there for the Tuesday evening Champions Dinner, which will be hosted by last year's winner, Hideki Matsuyama. </p>
<p> What does not square up is the idea that Tiger would play in a tournament he almost certainly knows he can't win. He admitted recently that it took him months and months of building up to win the 2019 Masters. </p>
<p> That's never really been a reality at any point in his career, but in his recent public appearances, Tiger has seemed more at peace with his career and himself than ever before. That implies there's a potential playing scenario hat he would have considered unthinkable at other points of his career. Woods might tee it up at the Masters, not because he believes he can win, but simply because he misses being there and playing in the most prestigious golf tournament in the world. </p>
<p> His return has, for the last 15 months, always seemed to be a speck on the horizon, a point out in front of him (and us) that didn't necessarily seem unattainable but did not feel imminent. That's the nature of car crashes involving golfers who have endured more surgeries than most folks have PGA Tour wins. </p>
<p> Now that we've reached the Masters -- this fully-attended April Masters, which has also seemed so far away for the past few years -- it suddenly no longer feels that way. </p>
<p> Tiger still might not play Augusta National this year, but there is at least hope -- a hope that has seemed enveloped in sadness and nostalgia for the past year -- that he could. </p>
<p> Woods' last April trip to Augusta was astonishing. He held off Brooks Koepka, Xander Schauffele, Dustin Johnson and Patrick Cantlay to win his fifth Masters and 15th major championship, and he did it all at the age of 43 at a point in time when his career was presumed (even by him) to be over. His spine had been fused together, and the rest of his body operated on innumerable times. </p>
<p> That moment, that Sunday afternoon at Augusta National Golf Club, was as storybook as sports get. And yet, three years, several more surgeries and one horrific day in Los Angeles later, it seems that Tiger just teeing it up at Augusta National this time around would be equally remarkable. </p>

<p> Match Report: Richmond 28 – 40 Coventry </p>
<p> Coventry turned up trumps yesterday in their postponed fixture against Richmond (originally set to take place in January). The Blue-and-White’s proved their away win against Bedford wasn’t a fluke by achieving a six-try triumph for Ryan Burrows final league showing of his career and the final game of the season. </p>
<p> Richmond started the game two points ahead of Coventry in the league table – adding an extra layer of determination for Cov to claim the points needed to finish higher in the hotly contested Championship mid-table. Despite the absence of Seitiki Nayalo who was called back for Army duties, Coventry fielded a strong side that saw the return of Matt Johnson from Exeter Chiefs. </p>
<p> The game kicked off to almost perfect rugby conditions in sunny London and Coventry went straight into attack mode, passing wide and nearly scoring in the corner in the opening minutes of the game. </p>
<p> The travelling Coventry faithful would have to wait another fifteen minutes to see the first try of the game, however, after Richmond got the whistle for not releasing. Rob Knox kicked for the corner and the pack moved like clockwork from the lineout. Coventry shifted the ball wide and found Ryan Burrows in the far corner. Robust Burrows proved a challenge for the hosts to take down, as he bound over the line with a couple of Richmond men attached at his hip. Burrows last even league try wasconverted byEvan Mitchell for the full seven points on offer. </p>
<p> In almost an identical fashion, it wasn’t long before ill-discipline reared its head again for Richmond and Coventry claimed the points from the advantage. Nearing the half-hour mark, Richmond got caught offside, allowing Cov to try their luck in the corner once again. Spinning the ball wide found the hands of Rob Knox this time, who darted over the line to place Coventry two tries ahead in the competition. Mitchell again with the extras. </p>
<p> Richmond made good inroads from the restart and a break from James Kane got his team into the 22. Jared Cardew then faked a dummy and sliced through Coventry’s defence for his team’s first try of the game. Kane handled the conversion well which reflected 7-14 on the scoreboard as 30 minutes stuck on the clock. </p>
<p> Making the most of their opportunities, just a few minutes later Coventry collected a box kick and charged through Richmond’s defence to score from 25m out. Josh Barton had a small fumble but found his feet just in time to roll over the line as he was taken down, try converted by Mitchell. </p>
<p> The following seven minutes of the first half saw Richmond have their fair share of chances but the only real opportunity for either side came in the final minutes with Kane once again kicking deep into Cov’s 22 which resulted in an attacking line-out for the visitors, 25 meters out. Richmond threw a loose pass, Cov collected and booted up the pitch. Although appearing threatening in their attack, the clock ran out before anything could come of the opportunity as the ball rolled into touch and the whilst blew. HT 7-21. </p>
<p> Richmond came out of the changing rooms firing with Kane supplying another opportunity for his team. Kane kicked the ball back at Coventry from deep in his half to find touch and a 50/22 just five meters out. Richmond go the distance from the line out and looked to have the try but the team was called back by the ref to take their penalty, kicking to the corner for another lineout. A strong Cov defence forced a turnover and resulted in a Coventry scrum to which they eventually escaped with a penalty and kicked clear of any danger. </p>
<p> Richmond’s patience would pay off, however, as they bagged the first try of the second half not long later. Coming from a rare jackal and penalty, Mark Bright tapped to go, before sending the ball to Cardew who beat the defence and charged over for his second, conversion added by Kane. </p>
<p> Coventry was quick to respond – just three minutes later in fact, as Louis Brown hot stepped his way through Richmond’s defence, making up 40m before drawing a bonus-point scoring pass to Josh Bainbridge beside him. Inevitably, Mitchell slotted the conversion. </p>
<p> With the pack now bolstered by the replacements of Tony Fenner, Dan Babos, Fred Betteridge, Luc Jeannot and Jake Bridges, another breakaway by Brown had Coventry looking good for another, but a loose pass would have Brown kicking himself as the ball was then stolen by Richmond in the danger zone. </p>
<p> Although Richmond had now lost their star man Kane due to a nasty facial injury, they regrouped and made the most out of their next opportunity in the 68th minute. After Coventry was pinned for a poor lineout, both teams packed down to scrum which was then met by another penalty given away by Cov and Richmond then kicked for the line. Spreading the ball wide would prove successful for Richmond too, allowing Will Kaye to easily score in the corner and converted by Edward Landry. </p>
<p> With ten minutes on the clock and only seven points between the two teams, the final two tries by Coventry were not only well needed but well-executed too. </p>
<p> The first came in the 72nd minute, with Louis Brown dazzling the defence with his dancing feet once again, shrugging off a tackle to draw to Tony Fenner for a converted try. </p>
<p> The second came from skipper Ryan Burrows and was scored by Dan Babos – although no conversion for the sixth and final try, Coventry had the game decided by extending the gap 21-40 in the space of five minutes. </p>
<p> Playing for pride, Richmond scored a fourth try in the final minute to wrap up the game FT 28-40. </p>

<p> Although the 2021/22 Championship League season is now wrapped up, there is still plenty on offer at Butts Park. Coventry U23 are matched with UK Armed Forces U23 for a friendly at Butts Park Arena next Friday as part of the new #NextGen fixtures which showcase the talent in Coventry Rugby’s ranks.

<p> Max Verstappen Vs Lewis Hamilton: Latest Feud Could Spark New Rivalry </p>
<p> Max Verstappen has been in on Lewis Hamilton's throat this past week after Mercedes star driver called him crash magnet and commented on his driving style. </p>
<p> Lewis Hamilton is one of the most decorated Formula 1 drivers in the current set up. The British driver already has five World Championships to his name and is on the verge of claiming his sixth title if he wins the title at United States Grand Prix or if he finishes eighth or better will do for him. A win in Austin will bring him within one of Michael Schumacher’s record haul of seven. </p>
<p> The 34-year-old's ride towards the title hasn't been without an intense rivalry with Red Bull driver Max Verstappen. With the five-time World Champion announcing his intention to stay in the sport for at least the next two years, the rivalry will only get more intense in the future. </p>
<p> The Dutch driver has been in on Hamilton's throat this past week after Mercedes star driver's comment on his driving style. Verstappen responded by claiming that the current World Champion was disrespectful with comments he made after winning the Mexican Grand Prix and that he is in Hamilton’s head </p>
<p> While the Mercedes team has been dominant on track, Hamilton's rivalry with Verstappen on track is a breath of fresh air in what is sometimes a dull sport. </p>
<p> During the Mexican Grand Prix, the 21-year-old collided with Valtteri Bottas on the opening lap of the race due to which he was criticised by Hamilton, who called Verstappen a crash “magnet". </p>
<p> Lewis Hamilton's F1 rivalries in the past </p>
<p> This is not the first time that Lewis Hamilton has had an intense rivalry and fierce battle. In the past as well, he has been in such a position with his former teammate Nico Rosberg in 2016. The tension between the two was so high that the pair did not even speak in the team’s canteen. </p>
<p> In 2007, Hamilton had quite a battle with Fernando Alonso also his teammate at McLaren. They had their face-off in Canada and Indianapolis before both ended up making mistakes that resulted in a loss of points and wins. The duo eventually lost to Kimi Raikkonen, with the Finn taking his first Championship crown at Ferrari. </p>
<p> The whole F1 world will be keeping a close eye on both the drivers (Hamilton and Verstappen) during the US Grand Prix and the remaining races of the season as the battle between the two is the one to be watched in future. </p>

<p> Mercedes 'not writing off 2022 title' - Marko </p>
<p> Dr Helmut Marko says he is more than happy that Red Bull has a new title protagonist to fight against in 2022. </p>
<p> Dr Helmut Marko says he is more than happy that Red Bull has a new title protagonist to fight against in 2022. </p>
<p> Last year, the Max Verstappen versus Lewis Hamilton battle was historically intense, resulting in bad blood between the teams that is likely to be permanent. </p>
<p> Marko says it's all very different now that Dutchman Verstappen is wheel-to-wheel with Charles Leclerc. </p>
<p> "Ferrari operates as we do," the 78-year-old told Servus TV. </p>
<p> "There is passion, emotion, sportsmanship, respect. You can feel that in every area. We have a competitive relationship, but with sporting rules, which is not only noticeable among the drivers, but also in the technical designs," Marko added. </p>
<p> However, the Austrian is not writing off Mercedes completely. </p>
<p> "Hamilton is only nine points behind Verstappen," Marko insisted. "They are not writing off the world championship at all. </p>
<p> "They will come back, for sure. It will probably end in a three-way fight." </p>
<p> Meanwhile, former F1 team boss Colin Kolles suspects Ferrari may have got a helping hand on its way back into world championship contention this year. </p>
<p> In 2020, the Maranello team reached a secret settlement with the FIA over the 'illegal engine' saga, with Ferrari pledging to help the governing body research the integration of bio-fuels. </p>
<p> Those E10 bio-fuel provisions are now up and racing in 2022, leaving Kolles wondering if Ferrari's work in the area may be the key to its sudden leap in pace. </p>
<p> "Looking back, maybe the penalty wasn't a penalty at all," Kolles told Sport1. "Maybe Ferrari even unintentionally benefited from the joint research with the FIA? </p>
<p> "I have heard that the Mercedes engine was missing half a second per lap in Saudi Arabia." </p>
<p> Marko, though, says that's an exaggeration. </p>
<p> "It's not that much," he insisted. "But their engine is definitely behind." </p>

<p> Toto Wolff says he cannot guarantee that Lewis Hamilton will return to F1 </p>
<p> This article is more than 3 months old </p>
<p> Wolff says Hamilton ‘will never get over’ Abu Dhabi F1 finale </p>
<p> Mercedes withdraw F1 title appeal after FIA agrees investigation </p>
<p> Mercedes’ team principal Toto Wolff says he can give “no assurances” that Lewis Hamilton will continue in Formula One after Sunday’s controversial season finale, saying the British driver is still in “pain” and “will never get over” what happened. </p>
<p> Speaking after Mercedes announced they had decided not to appeal the result of the Abu Dhabi race, Wolff doubled down on his criticism of race officials, describing Hamilton as a “sitting duck” who was “robbed of his crown” by race director Michael Masi’s decision to set up a last-lap shoot-out between the pair. That led to Max Verstappen, who was on fresh tyres, being able to overtake Hamilton to claim the race win and world title, much to Mercedes’ frustration. </p>
<p> “It is going to take a long time to digest what has happened on Sunday,” Wolff said. “I don’t think we will ever get over it, that’s not possible. Lewis and I are disillusioned at the moment. We’re not disillusioned with the sport. We love the sport with every bone in our body. And we love it because the stopwatch never lies. </p>
<p> “But if we break that fundamental principle of sporting fairness and authenticity, then suddenly the stopwatch doesn’t become relevant any more. Because we are exposed to random decision-making. And it is clear that you may fall out of love with a sport if you start to question, with all the work you have been doing, all the sweat and tears and blood.” </p>
<p> Wolff also repeatedly failed to give reassurances that Hamilton, who recently signed a new two-year contract with Mercedes, would be back to attempt a record eighth world title. </p>
<p> “I very much hope that Lewis continues racing because he’s the greatest driver of all time,” he said. “We will be working through the events over the next weeks and months and I think that as a racer, his heart will say: ‘I need to continue’, because he is at the peak of his game. </p>
<p> “But we have to overcome the pain that was caused upon him on Sunday, also because he is a man with clear values and it is difficult for him to understand how that happened. I just have to do the utmost that I can to help him overcome this, in order for him to return strong and with a love of the sport and trust in the decision-making of the sport next year.” </p>
<p> Confusion reigned on Sunday as race director Masi changed his mind to allow lapped cars to pass the safety car just before the last lap – giving Verstappen a clear run at longtime race leader Hamilton in the closing moments. Mercedes withdrew from any further action after the FIA announced on Wednesday it would investigate the process and decision-making around the end of the race, but Wolff stepped up his criticism on Thursday. </p>
<p> “It wasn’t just a bad call, it was a freestyle reading of the rules and it left Lewis like a sitting duck. The decisions that have been taken in the last four minutes of this race have robbed Lewis Hamilton of a deserved world championship. His driving in the last four races was faultless. He had a commanding lead from the get-go. He won the start and never gave the lead away again, and robbing him in the last lap of the race is unacceptable.” </p>
<p> But despite having what they believe to be a very strong legal case, Mercedes ultimately decided not to go ahead because they felt the FIA’s international court of appeal would back their own race director. </p>
<p> “It you look at the legal side, how it would have been judged in a regular court it is almost guaranteed that we would have won,” Wolff said. “But the problem with the FIA is the way it’s structured. The FIA can’t really mark their own homework, and there is a difference between being right and obtaining justice.” </p>
<p> Wolff also said he had no interest in talking to Masi, adding: “It is not only [about] a decision to change the race director. The whole system needs to be improved. I would have wished for more consistent decision-making throughout the year, but the last one was the decision that had the biggest impact – it decided the world championship.” </p>
<p> The Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, has insisted that Mercedes did not have grounds to appeal Sunday’s result. “Safety cars are usual in Formula One,” Horner said on Thursday. “Obviously the determination of the race director is always to get the race going again. That has been a clear mandate for many years.” </p>
<p> “A lot was made of it but that’s the way it is. We felt many things have gone against us this but things have a habit of balancing themselves out over the course of the year.” Horner was speaking at a press conference in Paris ahead of the FIA’s annual prize-giving gala. </p>
<p> Verstappen said the threat of losing his maiden world title after an appeal had not bothered him. “We knew we won it on the track when there was a green light or a green flag,” the Dutchman said. </p>
<p> “I don’t feel sorry [for Hamilton] but I understand it can be very painful. But, at the end of the day, that is racing. You have to keep fighting until the end and anything can happen. He also won a championship like that, so I think he can understand as well.” </p>
<p> As a protest neither Wolff nor Hamilton will attend the ceremony, despite the top three drivers in the world championship standings effectively being required to attend. </p>
<p> A statement from Mercedes added: “We left Abu Dhabi in disbelief of what we had just witnessed. Of course, it’s part of the game to lose a race, but it’s something different when you lose faith in racing.” </p>
<p> “We appealed in the interest of sporting fairness, and we have since been in a constructive dialogue with the FIA and Formula One to create clarity for the future, so that all competitors know the rules under which they are racing, and how they will be enforced.” </p>

<p> Miguel Berchelt enters sad, final arc of his career </p>
<p> Miguel Berchelt, who rose from obscurity to have a magnificent career, is about to find that out. </p>
<p> There’s no reason for the former WBO and WBC super featherweight champion to fight once again. He was repeatedly beaten to the punch Saturday at Resorts World in Las Vegas by Jeremiah Nakathila. He was knocked down once by a jab and he made Nakathila, a good but hardly sensational fighter, look like the reincarnation of Alexis Arguello. </p>
<p> Referee Russell Mora, on the advice of the ringside physician, halted the bout after six rounds. Mora has been around for years. He knew. You don’t have to have watched boxing closely for decades to see that Berchelt’s ability to take a punch has been severely compromised. His legs are no longer sturdy underneath him. </p>
<p> He’s got a big name, and he’s going to become target practice for ambitious and rising young stars who would love nothing better than to have the man who held a version of the 130-pound title for more than four years on their résumé. </p>
<p> The arc of most boxers is similar, though Berchelt is one of the lucky ones in that he made it to the top and made a good amount of money. He’s not going to leave boxing, whenever he makes that choice, a millionaire hundreds of times over like Floyd Mayweather, Manny Pacquiao, Mike Tyson and a few others did. </p>
<p> But this engaging young man from a poor and humble family in Mexico did more than all right for himself and is going to be able to live comfortably. </p>
<p> Very few boxers turn professional with much fanfare or notoriety. They have to fight, sweat and bleed just to get noticed. They’re often used as cannon fodder in practice by older, more experienced fighters preparing for big fights, the extra money they receive as a sparring partner so important to their ability to eat and pay the rent. </p>
<p> Most never get past the four-round stage. For those who do, there begins the climb. You hope to gain the attention of a powerful manager and a prominent promoter. You need both of those to be matched properly, to get the right fights, to make sure you’re getting what you deserve financially and to help you get attention from the public and the media. </p>
<p> Story continues </p>
<p> A small percentage of those graduate to contender status. Most, though not all, have the manager and have the promoter, but they need to attract the interest of television networks or streaming services. They fight increasingly difficult bouts, being matched many times with opponents more experienced and, at that stage, more talented. </p>
<p> If they survive there, they head to the championship stage. If they are talented enough and, yes, lucky enough to win a world title, they can expect to make some decent money. But they’re now fighting the best fighters in the world and they do it with a target on their backs. They become the Super Bowl for every other fighter in the division. </p>
<p> So the fights become harder, both because the quality of opponent rises and because said opponents will battle more fiercely because of what’s at stake. </p>
<p> Less than one-tenth of one percent of fighters are gifted like Mayweather or Andre Ward, fighters who took relatively small amounts of punishment compared to their peers because of their smarts and their physical skills. They also entered the sport from a big platform and are among the few who got the right opponents at the right time. </p>
<p> Most of them through the contender stage and the championship stage are fighting killers, pit bulls who are trying to fulfill a dream — theirs or someone else’s — of having a belt wrapped around their waist and their arm raised high to the sky. </p>
<p> Berchelt has lost his last two fights. He was 38-1 with 32 knockouts, but got viciously and violently knocked out by Oscar Valdez on Feb. 20, 2021, then again on Saturday by Nakathila. He left the arena for the second time in a row on a stretcher, slipped into an ambulance and made the trip to a local hospital for a safety examination. </p>
<p> Yet, from the sound of it, he’s not giving up. </p>
<p> “I’m going to get up. I’m going to rise from this,” Berchelt said afterward. “The great champions are not the ones who fall. The great champions are those who rise, and I will go home, spend time with my family, visit with them, get some rest, and I am going to come back stronger than ever.” </p>
<p> It’s a nice sentiment, but the odds against that becoming the truth, like so many who came before, are overwhelmingly against him. </p>
<p> His reflexes have been slowed by all of the battles he’s been in. His chin is no longer the same. It was unforgettable how, in 17 rounds over two knockout wins against Francisco Vargas, he ate big shots and kept menacing forward, throwing his own scary punches. </p>
<p> Those shots he took and shook off at the time add up and at some point, the body says, “No more.” Most ignore it and go on and into the final stage, when they lose fight after fight and get knocked out repeatedly. </p>
<p> Their names on a billboard or on a poster still have some value. They get fights if they want them against young up-and-comers who need a recognizable name on the résumé. People remember them, see the record and think maybe they can once again produce some magic. </p>
<p> More often than not, it doesn’t happen. In the final arc of the fighter’s career, the cheers are for someone else. The punches hurt more. The concussions are real. The reflexes are gone. The paychecks decrease. The risk of significant brain damage increases. </p>
<p> That’s where Miguel Berchelt sits right now. He can walk away and save himself and his family a lot of pain and heartache. He’s been a great champion who has had some mesmerizing moments. </p>

<p> NBA franchise stakeholder eyes a share in Indian Premier League </p>
<p> Mumbai: After acquiring a stake in NBA franchise Golden State Warriors, Indian expatriate and software entrepreneur Vivek Ranadive is now eyeing opportunities to invest in cricket's Indian Premier League (IPL). </p>
<p> Ranadive, founder and chief executive officer of California-based Tibco Software, was one of the 19 investors in the ownership group that bought the Warriors for $450 million (Dh1.65 billion) last year. </p>
<p> The multi-billion dollar IPL, which includes celebrity owners from the country's film and business industries, was also a perfect fit, the Mumbai-born Ranadive told Reuters in a telephone interview. </p>
<p> "Clearly India is a gigantic market. It's a market for the future and cricket is the sport that people are crazy about in India and the IPL has had quick and substantial success," he said. </p>
<p> The glamorous Twenty20 league was launched in 2008 with eight city-based franchises and two more teams were added for a combined price of $703 million to play in the 2011 season. </p>
<p> Ranadive, who has authored a New York Times business bestseller, was aware of the fact that entering an existing franchise as an investor was the only viable option in the foreseeable future. "There are a limited number of teams and the market is somewhat of a monopoly in the way it is structured. That, in a way, makes it even more valuable," he said. </p>
<p> "So I will stay alert to opportunities that might present themselves to participate in one of the franchises." </p>
<p> The difference in time zones was inconvenient for following cricket but that did not prevent him from watching India's victory in this year's World Cup, the 53-year old said. </p>
<p> "I don't follow it [cricket] nearly enough now being in California. But I watched the IPL with great interest and obviously I followed the World Cup with great excitement," Ranadive, a Harvard Business School alumni, said. </p>

He’ll join the Charlotte Hornets on a two-year, $26 million deal, according to a report from Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports. </p>
<p> This will be the fourth team in four seasons for Oubre, who has struggled to find any consistency with his game or place in the league. He’s coming off a disappointing season with the Golden State Warriors, during which he got off to a historically bad shooting start, and missed 15 of the final 20 games due to a hand and wrist injury. </p>
<p> Now healthy, he’ll have another chance to prove himself on a young, up and coming Hornets team. His size and athleticism aren’t in question, nor is his effort. But while he’s a versatile defender, he’s not quite as good as you’d hope on that side of the ball, and his offense is often too streaky. In particular, his 3-point shot just needs to be better. He’s at 32.6 percent for his career, and has never shot better than 35.2 percent. </p>
<p> The Hornets are making a big bet that Oubre can improve in those areas, and that his overall style of game will fit right in with the team they’re building. That, at least, seems likely. His ability to get up and down the floor will make the Hornets an even more dangerous in transition than they were last season, when they finished fourth in the league with 23.1 fastbreak points per game. </p>

<p> NBA News 2020-21: Top 10 players according to ESPN rankings; Check out </p>
<p> NBA News 2020-21: ESPN has released a list of the top 100 players in the NBA currently. While this list is based on performances of the last season, there have been some omissions according to various NBA fans. </p>
<p> It will be LA Lakers vs LA Clippers on the 11th of Dec; Check out all the NBA Preseason fixtures. The NBA preseason starts on December 11. The teams will be playing three or four games. </p>
<p> The NBA 2020-21 season begins on the 22nd of December. The LA Lakers and LA Clippers make the headlines again on the opening night. </p>
<p> 16x NBA All-Star, 4x NBA Champion, 4x MVP, 4x NBA Finals MVP, 16x All-NBA team LeBron James has signed a new 2-year, $85 million deal with the champions LA Lakers. </p>
<p> “King” James joined the 2018-19 season. In just one year, with the addition of Anthony Davis, LeBron James led the LA Lakers to an NBA title. He averaged 25.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 10.2 assists last season as he led them to the championship. </p>
<p> At 27 years old, Davis is the co-star of the Lakers with LeBron James — and the centerpiece of the franchise’s long-term future. </p>
<p> His arrival in a trade with New Orleans to join James elevated the Lakers out of six straight seasons in the draft lottery and hurtled them toward an eventual 2019-2020 NBA championship. </p>
<p> Davis averaged 26.1 points, 9.3 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 1.5 steals per game. He shot 50 percent from the floor, 33 percent from 3-point range, and a career-best 84.6 percent from the free-throw line. </p>
<p> The Milwaukee Bucks have been under great pressure ever since their star player Giannis Antetokuonmpo stated his uncertainty about his future with them. The 25-year-old is one of the best players in the current NBA generation. </p>
<p> Giannis Antetokuonmpo has averaged a double-double last season for the Bucks. He averaged 29.5 points, 13.6 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per contest in 2019-20. </p>
<p> The Greek Freak also had a field goal of 55.3% from inside the arc. He also shot the ball at 30.4% from outside the arc. He is the 3rd best player in the NBA according to ESPN. </p>
<p> The 21-year-old Slovenian native averaged approximately a triple-double last season. He scored 28.8 points, 9.4 rebounds, and 8.8 assists in 61 games. </p>
<p> Doncic will enter his fourth season in the NBA and is tied for the best odds to win MVP in 2020-21 at +450, same with Giannis, the reigning two-time MVP. </p>
<p> Kawhi Leonard joined the LA Clippers in a blockbuster move. He led the Toronto Raptors to victory in the NBA Finals against Golden State Warriors. </p>
<p> Although he and Paul George did not have a season they expected, they will be back with full force in the NBA 2020-21 season. </p>
<p> Kawhi averaged 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 4.1 assists for the LA Clippers last season. </p>
<p> 6. Kevin Durant </p>
<p> Kevin Durant suffered a torn Achilles, signed with the Brooklyn Nets, and endured a long rehabilitation period. He is finally ready to play for the Brooklyn Nets. </p>
<p> Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, his first “training camp workout” on Tuesday was an individual one. </p>
<p> The journey from tearing his Achilles in June 2019 to being prepared to play in the 72-game 2020-21 season has been a long one. </p>
<p> Lillard averaged an NBA-high 37.6 points and 9.6 assists in the seeding games, leading Portland to a 6-2 record. </p>
<p> The Trail Blazers won their final three seeding games, with Lillard scoring 51 points against the Philadelphia 76ers, tying his franchise scoring record with 61 points against the Dallas Mavericks. </p>
<p> He finished with 42 points and 12 assists in a victory over the Brooklyn Nets that clinched Portland’s spot in the Western Conference Play-In. </p>
<p> 8. Steph Curry </p>
<p> Being 32 years old, Curry will continue to be one of the NBA’s most dangerous shooters and offensive players. </p>
<p> The six-time All-Star and two-time MVP averaged 20.8 points and 6.6 assists in five games last season, and he’s a career 43.5 percent shooter from three. </p>
<p> The returns of Steph Curry featured in just five games for the Golden State Warriors last season because of a broken hand. </p>
<p> According to NBA.com, only 5.6 percent of Harden’s shots were catch-and-shoots, and 48.1 percent came after seven-plus dribbles. </p>
<p> More than half (55.7 percent) of his overall field-goal attempts in 2019-20 were three-pointers, per Basketball-Reference, but his game is also somewhat stated on getting to the basket or drawing fouls to shoot from the free-throw line. </p>
<p> In Nikola Jokic’s two playoff appearances, he shot the ball from 3-point land significantly better than he had in the regular season both years. In the 2019 postseason, which ended in the second round for Denver, the 7-footer shot 39.3 percent from beyond the arc, about nine percent higher than that year’s regular season. </p>
<p> Then, during the Nuggets’ incredible run in 2020, in which they overcame a pair of 3-1 series deficits before losing to the Lakers in the conference finals, he shot 42.9 percent, nearly 12 percent better than the regular season. </p>
<p> NBA Schedule: The tentative NBA schedule calendar for the 2020-21 season: </p>
<p> • Dec. 11-19, 2020: Preseason games </p>

<p> NBA News: Western Conference Games : June 11-12 | NBA Playoffs Series </p>
<p> The NBA’s Western Conference series both have the higher seed up 2-0 as we move into the weekend. The Phoenix Suns blew out the Denver Nuggets, 123-98, on Wednesday night, as Nuggets head coach Mike Malone said that his team basically “gave up” down the stretch. On Thursday night, the Utah Jazz fought off the L.A. Clippers once again, winning 117-111 behind 37 points from Donovan Mitchell. Let’s take a look at Game 3 of each series, with the teams down 0-2 now needing a win on their home floors to avoid the brink of elimination. </p>
<p> NBA News: Western Conference Games (June 11-12) </p>
<p> Friday, June 11 </p>
<p> Phoenix Suns at Denver Nuggets </p>
<p> Game 3 (10:00 pm ET, ESPN) | Suns lead, 2-0 Chris Paul’s shoulder seems to be just fine right now, as he led the Suns to a rout of the Nuggets, putting up 17 points and 15 assists without a turnover. Devin Booker put up 18 points and 10 boards. Mikal Bridges scored 16, and Deandre Ayton added 15 points and 10 boards. The Suns went into the locker room up ten at halftime, and Jae Crowder came out to knock down a couple of three-balls early in the third quarter to make it a 17-point advantage, and the Suns led by 19 points going into the fourth. </p>
<p> For Denver, Nikola Jokic had 24 points and 13 boards, coming a day after he received the league MVP award, but no one else could get things going consistently on offense. Michael Porter Jr scored 11 points and pulled down six rebounds in 27 minutes, but he only went 3 of 13 from the floor. Will Barton played for the first time in over a month, putting up 10 points in 16 minutes. Porter has been dealing with back issues, and Barton has dealt with hamstring issues. However, Austin Rivers was largely invisible. The Nuggets will need more contributions from their role players if they want to avoid a sweep. </p>
<p> Final Prediction: Phoenix 111, Denver 107 </p>
<p> Saturday, June 12 </p>
<p> Utah Jazz at L.A. Clippers </p>
<p> Game 3 (8:30 pm ET, ABC) Jazz lead, 2-0 Donovan Mitchell led the Jazz with 37 points, and the Utah defense clamped down on the Clippers late, forcing nine consecutive missed shots. Mitchell hit the game-clinching shot with 43 seconds left and then made one of two three frows after getting a hard foul from Paul George with ten seconds left. Mitchell is the first Utah player with at least 35 points in consecutive playoff games since Karl Malone did it in 1988. Jordan Clarkson chipped in 24, with six three-pointers, and Joe Ingles added 19 points. Rudy Gobert set a career postseason high with 20 boards and scored 13. </p>
<p> For the Clippers, Reggie Jackson led the way with 29 points, and Paul George added 27. Kawhi Leonard scored 21 but just had two in the fourth quarter. Bojan Bogdanovic started picking up Leonard full-court on defense in the fourth quarter, limiting him to just 1 of 4 shooting from the floor, along with a pair of turnovers. The Clippers did lead in the fourth quarter, 101-99, but then they missed nine straight shots during a 14-2 Utah run that left it 113-103 with 3:07 left on the clock. Mike Conley (hamstring) missed his second straight game, but even so, the Jazz have a six-game playoff winning streak. </p>
<p> Final Prediction: Los Angeles 114, Utah 110 </p>

<p> NBA: Sacramento Kings, Denver Nuggets Lock Arms In Show Of Solidarity With Ukraine's Len </p>
<p> The 28-year-old Ukrain player Alex Len, is a nine-year veteran of the NBA league and a former first-round draft pick by the Phoenix Suns. </p>
<p> NBA teams Sacramento Kings and Denver Nuggets brought their solidarity on the court for Ukraine players and their home country ahead of Thursday night's game at the Golden 1 Center. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began with air and missile strikes on military facilities before troops and tanks rolled across borders from the north, east and south. </p>
<p> NBA news: Denver Nuggets and Sacramento Kings show support towards Alex Len </p>
<p> Ukrainian player Alex Len, who plays for Sacramento Kings in NBA, saw the players of Denver Nuggets and Sacramento Kings holding a moment of silence and linking arms in a show of solidarity. Besides Alex Len, another Ukrainian player to feature in this year's NBA is Toronto Raptors Svi Mykhailiuk. </p>
<p> The 28-year-old Alex Len, is a 9-year veteran of the league and a former first-round draft pick by the Phoenix Suns. Mykhailiuk, 24, is in his fourth season and played 15 minutes off the bench for the Raptors. </p>
<p> Earlier, the two Ukrainian players had released a statement on Thursday condemning Russia's invasion of their country. The statement read, "A great tragedy befell our dear homeland Ukraine," they said in a joint statement on social media. </p>
<p> "We categorically condemn the war. Ukraine is a peaceful, sovereign state inhabited by people who want to decide their own destiny. We pray for our families, friends, relatives and all the people who are in the territory of Ukraine. We hope for an end to this terrible war as soon as possible. Dear fellow Ukrainians, Hold on! Our strength is in unity! We are with you!" </p>
<p> Russia invasion of Ukraine </p>
<p> According to the Republic TV crew in Ukraine, terror has gripped the Ukrainian people, who are desperately seeking to flee the conflict zone since early morning on Thursday. Thousands of cars piled up on roadways, and traffic in major Ukrainian cities came to a halt. </p>
<p> Gas stations in the country were full of vehicles, lined up to get their tanks filled before the fuel crisis started. Several countries have already requested the UEFA to strip Russia's hosting rights of the Champions League final. Amongst those who have opposed Russia as the venue of the Champions League final is British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. </p>

<p> NBA Trade Rumors </p>
<p> Share </p>
<p> In the National Basketball Association (NBA), a trade is a transaction that involves the movement of players from one basketball franchise to another. While players are the primary trade assets, draft picks and/or cash considerations can also be included, or be the basis for the trade to take place. The trade could involve either the swapping of players along with draft picks and/or cash considerations, or only draft picks (protected or otherwise). </p>
<p> NBA trade rules </p>
<p> NBA trade rules vary for each team depending on whether they're below the salary cap, a non-taxpaying team or a taxpaying team. </p>
<p> A team below the salary cap can execute a trade if the aggregate salaries of the incoming player(s) do not exceed the cap space that the team had plus $100,000. </p>
<p> For a non-taxpaying team (above the salary cap but below the luxury tax threshold), the total salaries of the incoming player(s) in a trade should not exceed the greater of the following two: </p>
<p> • The lesser of (A) 175% of the salaries of the outgoing player(s) plus $100,000 and (B) salaries of the outgoing player(s) plus $5 million </p>
<p> • 125% of the salaries of the outgoing player(s) plus $100,000 </p>
<p> For a taxpaying team, the total salaries of the incoming player(s) in a trade should not exceed 125% of the salaries of the outgoing player(s) plus $100,000. </p>
<p> NBA trade deadline </p>
<p> Following a directive from the Collective Bargaining Agreement of 2017, the NBA trade deadline for any particular season will be exactly 10 days before the All-Star Game, thereby ensuring that the date would be a Thursday. Based on the same rules, the NBA trade deadline for the 2019-20 season was on February 6, 2020, with the cutoff time being 3 PM ET. </p>
<p> The 2021 NBA trade deadline was an exception to this rule. Due to the condensed nature of the 2020-21 season, the 2021 NBA All-Star Game was held on March 7 while the trade deadline was on March 25 at 3 PM ET. Since no amendments have been made to the aforementioned rule yet, it's safe to assume that the league will return to complying with the same while setting the NBA trade deadline for the 2021-22 season. </p>
<p> NBA sign and trade </p>
<p> The NBA allows teams to sign-and-trade a player, i.e, trade the player after signing him to a contract within the stipulated rules of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). There is no limit to how many players may be traded in exchange for one - it is only limited by the size of the team’s roster (teams are allowed to have 15 players on their active roster on full contracts and 1 player on a two-way contract between the NBA and the G-League). Chris Paul, for example, was the subject of an 8-players-for-one deal, while in 2007, Kevin Garnett was traded by the Minnesota Timberwolves to the Boston Celtics in exchange for 7 players. </p>
<p> While several interesting sign-and-trades took place, the most interesting one of the lot saw Kevin Durant join the Brooklyn Nets in a move that also featured D'Angelo Russell moving the other way. Another impactful sign-and-trade saw Kemba Walker join the Boston Celtics from the Charlotte Hornets with Terry Rozier going the other direction. </p>

<p> Newcastle United become the richest club in the world. </p>
<p> Newcastle United have had a change in their ownership; Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund have bought 80% stake of the club in a deal which cost around 300 million euros. Both Amanda Staveley and Rueben Brothers have a stake of 10% each of the club. The club will be headed by Amanda Stavely who has promised that the club will have a promising future. </p>
<p> Many football fans have opposed this move because of Saudi Arabia’s human rights issues. Many fans believe that the Saudi PIF are using the club to ‘sport-wash” their image globally; They feel it’s completely unethical and immoral that the English FA have allow a Premier League club to have such owners. However, majority of the Newcastle’s fans seem unbothered by their owners background. The ‘Magpies’ have been struggling in the English league and their fans are desperate to see their club perform better in the near future. </p>
<p> Newcastle United will compete for Premier League title in the next few years </p>
<p> Saudi Arabia’s PIF are worth 700 billion euros which makes the Magpies the richest club in the world. The English side will try to sign many players over the upcoming transfer window. Rumours suggest that the club will try to sign many players such as Anthony Martial, Philipe Coutinho, Lingard and Icardi in the winter transfer window. It might take a few years to bring world-class players to St. James Park. </p>
<p> Newcastle United are 19th in the English league and haven’t been able to win a league game this season. The new owners will be hoping to see an improve in their teams performances; It is anticipated that Steve Bruce will be sacked over in the near future. However, the Magpies haven’t passed any statements till now. The clubs next match is against Tottenham on the 17th of October at 9 PM. </p>

<p> New England Patriots Free Agent Grades: 2 veterans brought on board </p>

<p> The New England Patriots have started to pick things up as the initial glamour of NFL Free Agency has begun to wear off. With other teams spending big, the Pats have mainly sat in the shadows, bringing back their own free agents while making some cheaper additions from outside the organization as well. </p>
<p> It’s been fairly boring for the most part, but hey, boring isn’t always bad. The Patriots have done a good job at bringing back most of their important free agents, which wasn’t always a guarantee heading into the offseason. Losing guys like J.C. Jackson and Ted Karras hurts, but finding ways to re-sign guys like Ja’Whaun Bentley and Devin McCourty has helped soften the blow. </p>
<p> After a spending spree in 2021 unlike one we had ever seen (until the Jacksonville Jaguars proceeded to one-up it this offseason), New England has gone back to their normal free agent strategy. Bill Belichick has refused to overspend on players, regardless of the situation, and while it can be frustrating to watch other teams make blockbuster after blockbuster, patience is key for the Pats moving forward. </p>
<p> Besides, New England has brought in some pretty solid players without blowing the bank on them. This past week, the Pats brought in a pair of key veterans, re-signing offensive lineman Trent Brown and luring old friend Malcolm Butler out of retirement. With the contract details now out, let’s take a look at both of these deals and assign them both a grade. </p>

<p> Boston Celtics center Robert Williams underwent surgery for a torn meniscus on Wednesday morning. Following surgery, the expectation is that Williams will return to the lineup in 4-6 weeks. </p>
<p> Williams was injured at some point in the Celtics victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday. Imaging showed the fourth-year center tore his meniscus in his left knee. </p>
<p> There is optimism Williams could return on the shorter end of his timeline. Four weeks would have Williams back towards the end of the first round or beginning of the second round of the playoffs. </p>
<p> Michael Porter Jr. has suffered a minor setback in his rehab from back surgery. </p>
<p> Porter underwent surgery on December 1st, which was the third of his career. </p>
<p> The setback stemmed from overcompensation and overwork amid his rehab, according to a source. </p>
<p> The Denver Nuggets have yet to determine whether Porter will be shut down for the remainder of the season. </p>
<p> Porter's agent, Mark Bartelstein, expressed optimism in late February that he would return in March. </p>
<p> The New Orleans Pelicans have signed guard Jared Harper from the team’s G League affiliate, the Birmingham Squadron, to a two-way contract. </p>
<p> Harper, 6-0, 175, appeared in two games with the Pelicans earlier this season, averaging 3.5 points and 1.5 assists in 5.0 minutes per contest. Harper has appeared in 13 career games across three NBA seasons with Phoenix, New York, and New Orleans. </p>
<p> In 29 games for the Squadron this season, Harper averaged 21.7 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 7.0 assists in 34.5 minutes per game. </p>
<p> Nikola Jokic is the current frontrunner for the 21-22 NBA MVP based on a new straw poll conducted by ESPN. Jokic was ranked second in the previous straw poll. </p>
<p> Jokic finished 62 first-place votes and a total of 860 points, followed by Joel Embiid, who had 29 first-place votes and 719 total points, and Giannis Antetokounmpo, who had nine first-place votes and 593 total points. </p>
<p> Ja Morant placed fourth while Jayson Tatum finished fifth. Luka Doncic and Devin Booker were the only other players to received third-place votes outside of the top three finishers. </p>
<p> If Jokic repeats as MVP, he would join Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Steve Nash and Tim Duncan as back-to-back winners of the award this century. </p>
<p> Keegan Murray will leave Iowa to enter the 2022 NBA draft. </p>
<p> "I am forever grateful that Coach [Fran] McCaffery gave me the opportunity to live out my dream," Murray told ESPN on Tuesday. "Iowa will always be my home and I'm forever grateful to be part of Hawkeye Nation." </p>
<p> Murray is the No. 5 prospect in the ESPN 100. </p>
<p> Murray took a unique trajectory to emerging as a potential top-five pick this June. He graduated from Prairie High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, with only one Division I scholarship offer from Western Illinois, prompting him to spend a post-graduate year at DME Academy in Florida, along with his twin brother, Kris. </p>
<p> Murray started this season projected as a first-round pick, but quickly proved to be one of the best NBA prospects in all of college basketball, as a 6-9 forward with a modern skill set and outstanding versatility on both ends of the floor. </p>
<p> There was no initial read on the severity of the injury and Mobley simply said the ankle was "sore." </p>
<p> “The injuries have kind of piled up and taken a toll on our depth,” J.B. Bickerstaff said. “But what we focus on is how connected the guys have continued to be and how much they want each other to be successful, how much they’ve bought into one another and bought into the team and played for something bigger than themselves. That’s continued from the beginning of the year until now.” </p>
<p> Trey Burke has entered the NBA's COVID-19 health and safety protocols. </p>
<p> Burke has previously said he is not vaccinated against COVID-19 and was in the protocols back in December. </p>
<p> In 39 games this season, Burke is averaging 5.3 points and 1.3 assists. </p>
<p> Oklahoma City Thunder forward Darius Bazley has joined a long list of teammates to be ruled out for the season. Bazley suffered a non-displaced tibial plateau fracture in his right knee. </p>
<p> Bazley had been one of the more durable members of the Thunder lineup this season. The third-year forward had played in 69 games this year, with 53 starts. Bazley averaged 10.8 points, 6.3 rebounds and a block per game. </p>
<p> Oklahoma City recently ruled several other players out for the season. Bazley joins Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Josh Giddey, Lu Dort, Ty Jerome and Mike Muscala on the sidlines for the rest of the year. </p>
<p> Kendrick Nunn is expected to be ruled out for the rest of the 21-22 season due to a bone bruise in his knee. </p>
<p> Nunn will still undergo an MRI on the knee even though he's expected to remain out as he continues to rehab. </p>
<p> Nunn has missed the entire season with the injury. </p>
<p> Anthony Davis could return to game action as early as Friday against the New Orleans Pelicans if he doesn't have any setbacks. Davis could also return on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets. </p>
<p> Davis has been out since February with a foot injury. </p>
<p> The Los Angeles Lakers are battling to secure a spot in the play-in. </p>

<p> WWE Smackdown – Smackdown Results and Highlights: Check out the big highlights and what happened on WWE Friday Night Smackdown Episode on Aug 21st: WWE Summerslam go-home edition of Friday Night Smackdown is streaming live from the Footprint Center in Phoenix, Arizona. Let’s check out the WWE Smackdown Results here in this post. </p>
<p> WWE Smackdown – Smackdown Results and Highlights: Check out the big highlights and what happened on WWE Friday Night Smackdown Episode on Aug 21st </p>
<p> Roman Reigns and John Cena’s Faceoff- It seems like Roman’s slow walk to the ring checked the patience of John Cena who didn’t hang around a bit and as soon as Roman was in the ring, Cena’s music hit and he came down rushing to the ring. </p>
<p> Roman Reigns started off by saying that a lot of people say a lot of stupid things for me. He said that this man (pointing towards Cena) thinks he can beat me 1,2,3. But this is not gonna happen. He asked Paul Heyman when was the last time i was defeated, Heyman replied, this Roman Reigns is yet to be defeated. </p>
<p> John Cena then started off that he came back last month not to promote his movies, but to pin Roman 1,2,3. He said that he has come back to take the Universal Championship from Roman and make Smackdown a better place, to become a 17-time world champion, to break Roman’s ego. </p>
<p> Roman was pissed after listening to Cena’s words and said that on Saturday, either he is walking out of the stadium as the Universal Champion or he will walk out of WWE. Roman Reigns then lifted Cena on his shoulder, but Cena retaliated by rolling up Roman for a pin that counted 1,2,3. Cena left the ring ecstatically, while Roman Reigns was left shell-shocked in humiliation, on his knees. </p>
<p> "Either I'm leaving that stadium as Universal Champion, or I'm leaving WWE." 🤯🤯🤯 </p>
<p> Bianca Belair vs. Carmella- Bianca defeated Carmella by hitting her with a Kiss of Death </p>
<p> Bianca Belair vs. Zelina Vega- Bianca defeated Xelina Vega by hitting her with a Kiss of Death </p>
<p> Shinsuke Nakamura & Rick Boogs vs. Apollo Crews & Commander Azeez- Boogs is making his in-ring debut on Smackdown with this match and he was the one to start the proceedings. His impressive moves surprised the fans present in the arena and he did pretty well until tagging in Shinsuke. </p>
<p> Crews tagged in Azeez but King Shinsuke was too good for Azeez as he was ready with his offense. In the closing moments, Crews was hit by an abdominal stretched slam by Boogs who picked up his first-ever victory on the show. </p>
<p> Montez Ford vs. Otis: Ford started off with a right strike on Otis’ face and then to the midsection. Ford took Otis to the corner and hit him with multiple strikes. However, Otis came back strongly with a sore right hand on the injured ribs of Montez Ford. </p>
<p> Since then, Ford was never able to get back into the match as Otis completely dominated from thereon. His right-hand strikes on Montez’s injured ribs were obnoxious and he wrapped up the proceedings with a middle rope splash on one half of the Street Profit member. </p>
<p> WWE Smackdown Results: Otis defeated Montez Ford via Pinfall </p>
<p> Seth Rollins in the ring- Seth Rollins started off by saying that Edge covered all the bases of excuses in his promo earlier why he will lose tomorrow night on Summerslam. While Seth Rollins was talking, everyone was chanting We Want Edge, Edge! Edge!, You Suck. </p>
<p> Seth further added there is no shame in finding yourself out of the darkness. As Rollins was speaking, the entire arena turned Red and The Brood’s music hit. Edge appeared on the big screen. It was a different side of the Rated-R Superstar, a side he was accustomed to when he was with The Brood. </p>
<p> After a minute or two, a black paint just poured all over Seth Rollins that humiliated him to the fullest. </p>
<p> Shotzi & Nox vs. Natalya & Tamina- Despite defeating them twice, Shotzi & Nox will yet again face Natalya & Tamina in a Women’s Tag-Team Championship contenders match. Shotzi and Tamina started off the proceedings and Tamina was viciously attacking Shotzi exploding her frustration. </p>
<p> Natalya then got in and continued the same momentum. She had her offense placed perfectly on Shotzi and wrapped her hands around Shotzi’s neck to incapacitate her. After a series of attacks, Nox finally got some opening with a neck breaker. </p>
<p> In the closing moments, Shotzi hit a cold knee to Tamina on the apron and then went on to roll-up Natalya to secure a third victory in a row over the Women’s Tag-Team Champions. </p>
<p> WWE Smackdown Results: Shotzi pinned Natalya to secure a win for her team </p>
<p> Backstage- The EST of WWE Bianca Belair gets interviewed by Kayla Braxton. Kayla mentioned Sasha Banks in the conversation but Bianca stopped her just right there as she wasn’t willing to talk about Sasha. </p>
<p> Baron Corbin vs. Kevin Owens- Baron Corbin made his way to the ring without any intro music and with the stolen Money in the Bank briefcase wrapped around his arms. </p>
<p> As the bell rang, Owens just when after Corbin with a series of left and right-hand strikes and multiple chops on the chest. Corbin then came back and started his offense for good. His right-hand strikes were ferocious that took Owens by surprise. Later Owens somehow get the opening and sent Corbin outside the ring for a Swanton dive from the apron. </p>
<p> As the match was progressing, Big E’s music hit and he came out furious. Corbin was shocked to see him and rushed towards the announce table where the Money in the Bank briefcase was kept. He took the briefcase with him but got attacked by Big E. As Big E was leaving with his briefcase, Corbin pushed him on the ring post and yet again fled away with the briefcase. </p>
<p> Jey Uso vs Rey Mysterio- A lock-up to start off the match and soon Jey Uso sends Rey outside the ring. Rey buys some time outside and returns to the ring and Rey caught him with his leg on the neck to roll him down on the mat. </p>
<p> Rey then got on the shoulders of Jey and hit him with a fierce combination of left & right strikes only to roll Jey outside the ring. Jimmy came to see Jey and Rey just dived with a reverse moonsault on the twin brothers to have the upper hand before heading into the commercial. </p>
<p> After the commercial, both men were inside the ring with Jey’s arm wrapped around Rey’s neck. He followed up with a vicious Samoan Drop to go for a quick 2-count. The two men were on the top turnbuckle and striking each other. Rey got some space to throw Jey with a top-rope hurricanrana. </p>
<p> At one moment of time, Rey went for a sit-top from the top turnbuckle and followed it up by swinging DDT. Rey then hit a 619 and was going for a roll-up pin with his son Dominik’s support, but the referee saw Dominik and send him off backstage. </p>
<p> This made Rey unamused and he went outside to debate with his son. The Uso brothers took advantage and attacked the Mysterio’s in ambush. Jey then sent Rey rolling inside the ring and hit the Uso Splash on him to pick up a pinfall victory. </p>
<p> Edge kicks off the show- Edge is sitting in the middle of the ring and started talking about what Seth Rollins said last week. He said that boot on the back of his neck in 2014 r.eally threatened him. </p>
<p> He then said that he knows what a curb stomp could do to his neck and probably could end his career. The triple-fusion neck surgery has him going through these years. He said he knows what Seth could do to him but he doesn’t fear him and will defeat him, humble him at Summerslam, and most importantly, burn him down. </p>
<p> RCB Playing XI vs KKR: RCB vs KKR Live: Royal Challengers Bangalore may have failed to defend 205 and lost the opening match but Faf du Plessis is not yet alarmed. Against KKR, they have a chance to redeem themselves and go with the same XI with Josh Hazlewood and Jason Behrendorff continuing to remain unavailable. The big question is will Mahipal Lomror get a chance? Follow RCB vs KKR & IPL 2022 Live Updates with InsideSport.IN. </p>
<p> RCB’s problem wasn’t batting in the first match against Punjab Kings. Faf du Plessis, Virat Kohli, Dinesh Karthik, Anuj Rawat all made their valuable contributions. However, the weaklink remains the bowling department. Akash Deep wasn’t effective while Mohammed Siraj had an off day. But removing Akash Deep for a spinner is out of question as the DY Patil Stadium already saw how ineffective spinners could to defend a total. </p>

<p> RCB Playing XI vs KKR: Should Mahipal Lomror come in? </p>
<p> The two players Lomror can replace in RCB Playing XI are Shahbaz Ahmed. </p>
<p> But Shahbaz Ahmed was untested in the first match. He has proven batting skills and he didn’t get to bat longer and hence Mahipal may have to wait for his chance. </p>
<p> The dew will render spin ineffective and that could force Faf du Plessis to go with Akash Deep again in place of a spinner as he is seam-bowling all-rounder. </p>
<p> However, if RCB are to improve their batting a little, Mahipal Lomror could be a valuable addition as he has shown time and again that he can play the shots while also anchor the innings. </p>
<p> Working on extras: What RCB will have to work on is their giveaways. Siraj conceded 14 extras alone in wide deliveries. Harshal Patel conceded five. In all, there were 22 runs extra and in a T20 match, games are won in the margin of just a run. That will be their aim. </p>

<p> KKR Playing XI vs RCB: IPL 2022 Live Updates – Kolkata Knight Riders got their IPL 2022 campaign off to a fine start as they sealed a win over defending champions Chennai Super Kings at the Wankhede. New captain Shreyas Iyer had a lot of positives to take from the game. While he has no reason to change his team, Tim Southee is likely to replace Shivam Mavi as they face off against Royal Challengers Bangalore on Wednesday.

<p> Although showing promise, Shivam Mavi had a wicketless outing against CSK. With Tim Southee available, he will bring in a lot of experience besides batting depth. The bowling did well in the opener against Chennai Super Kings, restricting the defending champions to just 131 with Umesh Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy and Sunil Narine all delivering the goods. </p>
<p> Shivam Mavi struggled in the death with Tim Southee making a comeback to KKR Playing XI. </p>

<p> As far as the batting is concerned, Ajinkya Rahane scored a fine 44 to nail his place at the top of the order, with Venkatesh Iyer for company. Nitish Rana, Shreyas Iyer and Sam Billings all played valuable cameos in the opener and should make up the middle order with Andre Russell and Sunil Narine in as finishers. </p>
<p> Sheldon Jackson starred with his excellent keeping against CSK and should feature, though KKR could debate the possibility of an extra bowler, especially with Billings in the side. </p>

<p> RCB vs KKR Dream11: Prediction: Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) will be up against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL).

<p> RCB vs KKR Dream11 Prediction: Royal Challengers Bangalore vs Kolkata Knight Riders 2022 Dream11 Team Picks, Probable Playing XI, Pitch Report and match overview, RCB vs KKR Live at 7:30 PM on Wednesday, Mar 30 </p>
<p> RCB would be desperate to make a comeback after a five-wicket loss in a high-scoring game against PBKS. The Faf du Plessis-led side’s batting clicked, but the bowling was a huge letdown. The team could not defend a mammoth score of 206. Mohammed Siraj, Harshal Patel, and Wanindu Hasaranga had a rare failure. </p>
<p> The trio would look to make amends by putting on a better show. RCB had a few positives to take from the PBKS game. One of them was Anuj Rawat’s contribution at the top. The southpaw batted well and scored a handy 21 runs. Dinesh Karthik also finished the match superbly for RCB. The bowlers now need to get their act. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, KKR did well both bat and ball in hand. First, their bowlers kept a strong CSK batting lineup to just 131. Later, their batters clinically went about their business and finished the match without much fuss. Shreyas Iyer was street smart on his captaincy debut for KKR. He was spot on with bowling changes and rotated the bowlers well. </p>

<p> PAK vs AUS Dream11 Prediction- Australia can win the series – Australia will try to seal the three-match ODI series on Thursday (March 31) as they will come into the second ODI having taken a 1-0 lead.

<p> Can Pakistan stop Travis Head? – Travis Hear was in outstanding form in the first ODI as he scored a blistering 101 off just 72 deliveries. The innings included 12 fours and three sixes as he scored at a strike rate of 140. He will be big hurdle to cross if Pakistan are to keep their hopes alive in the series. </p>
<p> Pakistan need to find missing piece in the puzzle – The Pakistan bowling lineup was all over the place as they were gave away 313 runs. Travis Head and Ben McDermott were the major culprits for Pakistan as they both dismantled their bowling. Hasan Ali and Mohammed Wasim were both expensive in the opening ODI and will need to come good for Pakistan in remaining ODIs. </p>

Follow RCB vs KKR LIVE Updates and IPL 2022 LIVE Updates with InsideSport.IN </p>
<p> While the Shreyas Iyer-led KKR humbled defending champions Chennai Super Kings by six wickets, Royal Challengers Bangalore suffered a five-wicket loss to Punjab Kings, despite posting a 200-plus score. </p>
<p> RCB vs KKR Live: Focus on bowling as Faf du Plessis’ RCB aim improved show against Shreyas Iyer’s high-flying KKR – Follow IPL 2022 Live Updates </p>
<p> RCB Team News </p>
<p> RCB vs KKR LIVE Score: For RCB, skipper Faf Du Plessis is in prime form after he made a scintillating 57-ball 88 and would like to continue in the same vein. Opener Anuj Rawat was unable to capitalise on a good start and would be aiming for consistency. </p>
<p> Unburdened by the captaincy pressure, Virat Kohli made a statement and played with more intent against Punjab. He will definitely look to rediscover his glorious touch and continue to torment the opposition bowlers like he did during his prime. </p>
<p> Wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik also played a significant cameo and his role would be crucial once again, if RCB have to set or chase a big total. </p>
<p> If these four go all guns blazing, then it would be a daunting task for the varied KKR attack. </p>
<p> While the KKR bowling unit will have to be particularly cautious of the six-hitting prowess of Du Plessis, which was on display on Sunday, RCB bowlers would have to quickly forget the hammering they received at the hands of the Punjab batters. </p>
<p> A profligate Mohammed Siraj, who leaked 59 runs, will have to pull up his socks. Another key bowler is death overs specialist and last edition’s Purple Cap holder Harshal Patel. Even the role of Sri Lankan spinner Wanindu Hasaranga, who is capable of spinning a web around the batters, could decide the fate of the match. </p>

<p> KKR Team News </p>
<p> RCB vs KKR LIVE Score: For KKR, they ticked all the boxes in their lung-opener against CSK and they would be hoping that they can repeat their performance. </p>
<p> The biggest positive for KKR was Ajinkya Rahane finding his mojo and scoring runs. Although all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer managed only 16 runs in the first game, he is capable of pummelling any attack into submission. </p>
<p> Skipper Shreyas Iyer along with Sam Billings and Sheldon Jackson would need to shoulder responsibility in the middle-order. </p>
<p> On the bowling front, Umesh Yadav was sensational at the Wankhede. But others including Shivam Mavi, spinners Varun Chakravarthy and Sunil Narine would need to put up an improved show. </p>

<p> All-rounder Andre Russell’s role with the bat and ball could eventually be the difference between the two sides. </p>
<p> KKR are unlikely to tinker with their winning combination. </p>
<p> Being an evening game, dew would certainly be a factor and one can expect a high-scoring affair. </p>

<p> IPL 2022: Maharashtra govt to increase crowd capacity- In a bid to increase fan experience in the Indian Premier League (IPL 2022), the Maharashtra govt has ideated to increase crowd capacity up to 50% from the first week of April. However, the final call on the decision is yet to be taken as BCCI is still in a “two-mind” about the issue. Follow IPL 2022 Live Updates on Insidesport.IN </p>
<p> Sources are believed to have revealed to TOI, “With the number of Covid-19 cases dropping drastically, the state government wants to increase the crowd capacity in IPL-15 up to 50%.” </p>
<p> IPL 2022: GOOD NEWS for fans! Maharashtra govt to increase crowd capacity to 50% from April </p>
<p> “Assuming that last year’s IPL should be moved abroad because of the second wave, they want to play it safe for now. BCCI wants to review crowd capacity around April 15, when the first phase of the league will be held over,” the source said. </p>
<p> Former ICC, BCCI and MCA president Sharad Pawar, a key player in the MVA government in the country, has had positive discussions in this regard with Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. Both are on the same page on this issue. However, the BCCI is yet to decide on this issue. </p>
<p> IPL 2022: GOOD NEWS for fans! Maharashtra govt to increase crowd capacity to 50% from April </p>
<p> One may ask why the BCCI is contemplating for an increase in capacity. The real reason is the demand for tickets amongst government officials and commercial partners. Out of the capped capacity, the BCCI had to give away tickets to Mumbai Cricket Association, Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) besides commercial partners, sponsors, players and government officials including the police, fire brigade amongst others leaving behind only a minimal no of tickets for the public. </p>

<p> AUS-W beat WI-W: Australia advance to FINALS after massive win; beat West Indies by 157 runs- A brilliant century from Alyssa Healy and an outstanding cameo from Rachael Haynes helped Australia defeat West Indies in the semi-finals by 158-run in the ongoing ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2022 here at the Basin Reserve on Wednesday. </p>
<p> Healy smashed 129 from 107 balls and Haynes scored 85 from 100 deliveries putting on 216 runs for the opening wicket to help Australia amass 305/3 in a rain-curtailed match, which was reduced to 45 overs. Chasing 306, skipper Stafanie Taylor (48) played a lone hand for West Indies, while Deandra Dottin and Hayley Matthews scored 34 runs each at the top of the order. But they received little support from others as Australia cruised home. </p>
<p> Experienced spinner Jess Jonassen bowled well to claim two wickets and five others picked up one scalp each, while Beth Mooney took the catch of the tournament to go with her unbeaten 43 with the bat. </p>
<p> AUS-W beat WI-W: Australia advance to FINALS after comprehensive win; beat West Indies by 157 runs </p>
<p> Earlier, Healy and Haynes put on 216 runs for the opening wicket at an excellent clip as Australia amassed a huge score after being sent into bat first. It was a scintillating partnership from Healy and Haynes, as the duo dined out on some poor West Indies bowling to put on the third-highest opening stand in Australia’s WODI history. </p>
<p> Shamilia Connell finally got the breakthrough when she had Healy caught in the deep in the 33rd over. </p>
<p> West Indies seamer Chinelle Henry also picked up Ash Gardner, promoted up the order to number three, in the same over to help reduce Australia to 236/3. </p>
<p> But Beth Mooney 43* and Meg Lanning 26* took the score past 300 and left West Indies with a mountain that was too difficult to climb as Australia moved through to the title decider with ease. </p>
<p> Brief scores: Australia 305/3 (Alyssa Healy 129, Rachael Haynes 85; Chinelle Henry 2/51) vs West Indies 148/10 (Stafanie Taylor 48, Hayley Matthews 34; Jess Jonassen 2/14). </p>

<p> A former Mercedes employee is reportedly leaking information to Red Bull, according to reports </p>
<p> According to German publication Auto Motor und Sport, a former Mercedes employee now working at Red Bull F1 has been leaking information regarding the Silver Arrows' controversial rear wing. </p>
<p> According to the reports, the illegality of Mercedes' rear wing would be hard to detect due to the complexities of its design. However, an element on the wing could be against the technical directive issued about "flexi-wings" in the summer. </p>
<p> #AMuS Michael Schmidt about the Mercedes rear wing (flexi wing) theory (by Red Bull) </p>
<p> Speaking on a video episode of "Former Schmidt" on Auto Motor und Sport, veteran F1 journalist Michael Schmidt explained how Red Bull Racing suspected Mercedes' rear wing element of providing an advantage even when the DRS is closed. </p>
<p> While Red Bull didn't lodge a formal protest during the Brazil Grand Prix weekend, the Silver Arrows could face a lot of questions about their rear wing element at the Qatar Grand Prix. </p>
<p> With three races left until the season ends, the Milton Keynes outfit will likely be keeping a close watch on the legality of Mercedes' unique rear wing, and the difference it makes in their performance on the straights. </p>
<p> Red Bull hired staff from Mercedes earlier in the season </p>
<p> Red Bull have been successful in poaching some of Mercedes' High Performance Powertrains staff this season for their engine development. </p>
<p> According to Schmidt, one of the poached former employees, has spoken in detail about their rear-wing theory. That led Red Bull's ace designer Adrian Newey and technical director Paul Monaghan to approach Nickolas Tombazis, head of FIA single-seater and technical matters, at the Brazil Grand Prix weekend. </p>

<p> Red Bull looking for answers over 'unraceable' Mercedes and their rear wing trib.al/LFs7xmB </p>

<p> TheDailySportsHerald's sources indicate that the Los Angeles Galaxy soon might be signing Brazilian star Ronaldinho to a contract for an undisclosed amount. An agreement in principle apparently has been reached between the parties, with the expected announcement of the potential deal set for late June or early July. In 2010, the MLS amended the salary cap rule to increase the allowable number of designated players on each team from one to two. Designated players are exempt from the salary cap of $2.55 million as of 2010. The 30-year old Ronaldinho recently was denied a chance to win his second World Cup championship when he was left off the Brazilian team by head coach Dunga. Having played for top tier teams such as Barcelona and AC Milan, the skillful Brazilian is sure to bring the best out of an already improving Galaxy squad. By Adrian Yeung Staff Reporter for TheDailySportsHerald.com </p>

<p> Most of the NFL mock drafts focus on the early rounds, but there are still many prominent college players who will hear their names called later. </p>
<p> As these top 20 prospects get ready for the draft, here's a look at some of their closest NFL comps. </p>
<p> The Rams are Super Bowl LVI champs, and the NFL calendar has flipped to 2022. Here's a look at the Super Bowl LVII odds from FanDuel Sportsbook as of February 21, 2022. </p>

<p> The early picks got most of the hype heading into the draft, but it's the later picks that could make all the difference in an eventual Super Bowl. </p>
<p> The NFL prospects from big college programs get most of the hype, but every NFL draft brings significant contributors from smaller schools. </p>
<p> A few weeks ago, we highlighted some of the betting options available for the NFL Draft, and things have mightily shifted since then. When we last looked at the odds for the first-overall pick, it was Evan Neal who was the favorite. </p>
<p> After several crazy weeks of free-agent signings and trades, team needs are clearer. Here's a look at our first-round mock draft, as of March 25, 2022. </p>
<p> Many college football players helped their draft stock during the 2021 season with their great play. These 25 players are among the prospects that have helped their stock the most. </p>
<p> Various blueprints exist throughout NFL history of how to orchestrate quarterback transitions. Some have panned out, while the failures show how difficult this task can be. </p>
<p> Heading into the offseason, all 32 teams have clear needs to address both in the free-agent market and the draft. Here's a look at the biggest draft needs for all 32 NFL organizations. </p>
<p> While extraordinarily uncommon in the modern NFL, select teams have made multiple top-10 picks in the same draft before. Here are the teams to do so since the common draft began in 1967. </p>
<p> From sack records to players that impacted playoff teams' fortunes, here are the NFL's top defensive seasons from first-year performers. </p>

<p> As of the end of the 2021 NFL season, 36 active NFL players have had multiple seasons in which they had 1,000 or more receiving yards. How many can you name in five minutes? </p>
<p> While going from last place in a division to first was once infrequent, the NFL sees it happen nearly every year in the modern era. Here are the most notable worst-to-first seasons -- judged by impact and degree of improvement -- since the modern divisional setup began in 1970. </p>
<p> Days away from free agency, the NFL's quarterback carousel has finally begun to spin. While the Broncos made a transformative trade and the Packers locked down the reigning MVP, many teams still are trying to upgrade their QB situations; here is how the 32 stacks up going into the 2022 league year. </p>

<doc id="file24155719" filename="nfl-sunday-ticket-moving-to-streaming-service-in-2023-could-be-worth-2-5-billion-per-year" parent_folder="web1" url="https://deutschland.football/nfl-sunday-ticket-moving-to-streaming-service-in-2023-could-be-worth-2-5-billion-per-year/">
<p> NFL Sunday Ticket moving to streaming service in 2023, could be worth $2.5 billion per year </p>
<p> NFL Sunday Ticket came out in 1994, launching on DirecTV as a way to connect football fans to Sunday games that were outside of their TV market. After 30 years with DirecTV, the National Football League is taking its prized broadcasting package elsewhere. </p>
<p> Once the NFL signed its new collective-bargaining agreement with the NFL Players Association, focused shifted towards contracts for broadcasting rights to games. Amazon bought the exclusive rights to every Thursday Night Football game for $1 billion per year and the NFL’s new contracts with Fox, Disney, CBS and NBC are reportedly worth an estimated $100-plus billion over the life of the 10-year contracts. </p>
<p> With those deals signed and going into effect for the 2022 season, NFL Sunday Ticket is the next priority. </p>
<p> According to Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk, Sunday Ticket will move to a streaming service in 2023. While an exact host remains undetermined, the NFL is moving forward with its plan to separate its coveted package from satellite service. </p>
<p> The bidding war is going to be intense. CNet’s Eli Blumenthal reported on Feb. 18 that the league is looking for upwards of $2.5 billion annually for the rights to NFL Sunday Ticket in its next contract. </p>
<p> Who will have NFL Sunday Ticket in 2023? </p>
<p> During the 2021 season, DirecTV charged $300 per month for their base Sunday Ticket package and had a $400 monthly charge for the ‘Max’ version. Despite the high price, Front Office Sports reported in September that NFL Sunday Ticket boasted 2 million subscribers. </p>
<p> The bidding war for the rights to the exclusive streaming package will feature marquee companies. Disney (ESPN+), Amazon (Amazon Prime) and Apple (Apple TV) all reportedly maid bids for NFL Sunday Ticket. The company with the winning bid would then reportedly make its own decision regarding access to the service for those in markets without internet access suitable for streaming. </p>
<p> “It now appears (per a source with knowledge of the dynamics) that the league will sell the whole package to a tech company, which then may break off satellite rights to be sold only to consumers (typically, very rural) who lack access to the kind of Internet service needed for reliable streaming. That could be DirecTV, it could be Dish Network, it could be both, and it could be neither.” </p>
<p> Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio on the future of Sunday Ticket </p>
<p> Amazon remains the favorite as of now, but Apple and Disney both want to expand their live sports content. Whenever a deal is signed, NFL revenue will skyrocket even wither with owners and players cashing in on the returns. </p>

<p> Oleksandr Usyk Vs Anthony Joshua Rematch In April 2022? Here's Everything We Know </p>
<p> Oleksandr Usyk defeated Anthony Josuha in the 1st fight between both boxers in September this year and captured the WBA, IBF and WBO world heavyweight titles. </p>
<p> On September 25, 2021, Ukrainian professional boxer Oleksandr Usyk defeated unified heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua and retained his undefeated record, earning the WBA, IBF, and WBO world heavyweight titles in the process. Having faced the defeat after the fight that lasted for 12 rounds and after a unanimous decision against him, Joshua was quick to initiate the rematch clause and also said during the post-match press conference that there will definitely be a re-match. </p>
<p> Eddie Hearn confirms Usyk vs Joshua is still on cards for April 2022 </p>
<p> Joshua’s promoter Eddie Hearn also weighed in on the same by adding that the re-match will likely be held in February or March. However, as per a recent report by Boxing Scene, Hearn has said that the rematch against Usyk is still on the track to take place in April 2022. As per Boxing Scene, speaking to IFL TV, Eddie Hearn said, “Obviously not much other than we got to get together and decide a date. April is realistic for that fight and where it’s going to be”. </p>
<p> Joshua’s promoter further added that the former two-time champion Joshua is a boxer who fights twice a year, but they feel it would be nice to fight thrice a year. However, he added that although they have received offers from around the world, yet the United Kingdom is likely to stage the fight. Further informing about talks with Usyk’s manager, Hearn said, “We have to sit down with [Usyk’s manager] Alex Krassyuk, and we’ll get Christmas out of the way and we’ll start moving forward with that because it’s time to start planning for that”. </p>
<p> Joshua was certain of the rematch ever since his second reign as the world heavyweight champion came to an end in September. He previously held the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, and IBO titles from 2016 to 2019, before losing them to Andy Ruiz Jr. He regained the titles in a rematch in Saudi Arabia and reigned until one of the biggest fights of 2021. However, Usyk won the world heavyweight titles the third man, after Evander Holyfield and David Haye to win world titles at cruiserweight then heavyweight. </p>

<p> § Do leaders need luck to succeed?Many of the most successful business leaders appear to have essentially lucked their way into the jobs that made them famous -- but there's much more to their rise to the top than mere chance, writes Steve Tobak. The best leaders are both superb networkers and natural opportunists, able to schmooze their way into interesting situations and then spot and seize opportunities that present themselves. BNET/The Corner Office blog (3/15) § The education of Howard SchultzStarbucks chief Howard Schultz has a reputation as an impulsive, idiosyncratic visionary, capable of spurring his company to new heights but also of making brash moves that sometimes backfire. Lately, though, Schultz has shown a more humble leadership style, and allowed himself to be guided by subordinates and focus groups in ways that observers say has made Starbucks a more successful and stable enterprise. "What leadership means is the courage it takes to talk about things that, in the past, perhaps we wouldn't have, because I'm not right all the time," he says.

<p> Strategic Management § Disasters show fragility of Japan's manufacturing baseThe Japanese auto industry is in turmoil after last week's earthquake and tsunami, with plants offline, rail and highway infrastructure knocked out and inventories of parts and completed vehicles damaged or destroyed. Industry watchers say the disaster has called attention to the fragility of Japan's complex and much-emulated manufacturing strategies. "Running smoothly, it is highly productive.

"I think the biggest mistake we, as marketers, make is thinking that it's only about colors and logos and slogans.

<p> Samuel Eto'o 2010/11 Italian Serie A Games Goals Assists 12 8 2 Full Name Samuel Eto'o Birth Date March 10, 1981 Birth Place Douala, Cameroon Height 1.79m Weight 75 kg Age 29 Position Forward Squad No 9 ProfileStatisticsGame Log Samuel Eto'o Bio Send To Friend With lightning pace and a deadly eye for goal, Inter Milan 's Samuel Eto'o has established himself as one of the world's best strikers. The Cameroon striker had a slow start to his career, struggling to make the grade as a youngster at Real Madrid, but after moving to Real Mallorca in 2000 he began to shine. He became the club's all-time leading domestic scorer in four years and earned himself a big money move to Barcelona. It was at the Nou Camp that Eto'o elevated himself into the upper echelons of the world's best players, scoring for fun for the Catalans - with 125 strikes to his name in just 183 games. His impact was immediate as his goals helped Barca win the La Liga title in 2005 and then the Champions League in 2006. Injuries hampered his 2007-08 campaign but he still managed 11 goals in 17 league starts. Eto'o was imperious in the Catalans' treble winning 2008-09 season, netting 34 goals in 44 appearances in all competitions. But with a plethora of talent around him, coach Pep Guardiola decided Eto'o was surplus to requirements and traded him in for Zlatan Ibrahimovich in a move that saw the Cameroon forward move to the San Siro, where he continued to display his scoring exploits in Serie A. At international level, Eto'o has excelled and is Cameroon's all-time leading scorer with 42 goals in 87 games. He got his first taste of World Cup football in 1998, making a single appearance as a substitute in Cameroon's 3-0 group stage defeat to Italy. But he quickly became an integral part of the Indomitable Lions team, scoring the winner in Cameroon's sole victory at the 2006 finals, against Saudi Arabia and winning the African Nations Cup in 2000 and 2002, as well as winning golden boot for being top scorer at both the 2006 and 2008 tournaments. He was Cameroon's top marksman in qualifying for the 2010 World Cup, netting nine goals in 11 games. Strengths: Pace and finishing, Eto'o is an expert at getting on the shoulder of the last defender, accelerating away and showing great composure to score in one-on-one situations. Weaknesses: Not the most technically gifted player, and has often been accused of getting easily frustrated and having a poor temperament. He was accused of being selfish by then Barca team-mate Ronaldinho. Career High: Scoring in two Champions League finals for Barcelona. He netted the equaliser against Arsenal in the Catalans' 2006 win and the opener against Manchester United in the 2009 triumph. Career Low: Being fined €12,000 for chanting "Madrid, cabron, saluda al campeon" (Spanish for 'Madrid, bastards, hail the champions') during a speech at the Nou Camp celebrating Barcelona's 2005 la Liga triumph. Style: Prolific, pacey, strong and has world class finishing ability. Quotes: "History shows that this club has had very few strikers like him. I do not know if there has ever been anyone like him before. What I do know is that Barcelona should erect a statue for him. Samuel was a fundamental player here in recent years and was key to all of the titles that the team won." Andres Iniesta, August 2009. Trivia: To celebrate qualification for the 2010 finals, Eto'o bought each member of the Cameroon squad a £29,000 watch, with a dedication from him inscribed on the back. </p>

<p> Paul George injury update: Clippers star to return Tuesday vs. Jazz after three-month absence, per report </p>
<p> George has been out since December with an elbow issue </p>
<p> The Los Angeles Clippers have been playing with an incomplete roster all season. Kawhi Leonard hasn't taken the floor at all while recovering from a torn ACL, and his co-star, Paul George, has suited up just 26 times due to a variety of injuries. George last played on Dec. 22. A torn UCL in his right elbow has kept him out ever since, and given the nature of the injury and the surgery that followed, there appeared to be a chance George would miss the remainder of the season. </p>
<p> However, after playing 5-on-5 Sunday and practicing Monday, George is expected to take the floor Tuesday night against the Jazz for his first game action in over three months, per Shams Charania of Stadium and The Athletic. The Clippers had listed him as questionable for the game against Utah. When asked if he could be cleared to play this week, Lue responded by saying that it would depend on how George feels. Barring any setbacks, he'll be back after three-plus months of being out of action. </p>

<p> George's return isn't the only positive injury news for the Clippers as ESPN's Ohm Youngmisuk reported reported that Norman Powell could be back to practicing within the next 7-10 days if his rehab continues to progress in a positive direction. </p>
<p> The Clippers are currently seeded eighth in the Western Conference and are all but assured to remain there as they lead No. 9 New Orleans by four games and trail the No. 7 spot by 6.5 games. That means that the Clippers will have two chances to reach the playoffs: a road game against whoever finishes No. 7, and should they lose that contest, a home matchup with whoever wins the No. 9 vs. No. 10 play-in game, which could easily be their Staples Center co-tenants, the Los Angeles Lakers. </p>
<p> That the Clippers have managed to stay afloat without George and Leonard is a testament to the quality of the rest of their organization. The Clippers have cultivated a remarkably deep roster with an excellent coaching staff, and even if they have been held out of the championship race, just staying in the top eight considering the injuries they've dealt with is a remarkable achievement. </p>
<p> With a healthy George, this team becomes even more lethal. Remember, the Clippers pushed the eventual Western Conference champion Suns to the brink without Leonard in the 2021 postseason. If George is able to return, the Clippers would be a threat to anyone they face in the playoffs. Now, that possibility appears to be in play. </p>

<p> Things got a little hairy thanks to Major League Baseball’s 99-day lockout of its players, but we’ll soon be (hopefully) treated to another season of Philadelphia Phillies baseball around these parts. And with new action on the field, of course, comes the opportunity for baseball lovers and stat geeks everywhere to try their hand at fantasy baseball once again. </p>
<p> Just like everything in the betting/fantasy landscape nowadays, there are a myriad of ways to play. But I like to stick to the tried and true method of assembling and guiding a team for the whole year and leaving the daily stuff to others. And so let’s kick off this two-part series by taking a look at what the Phillies might have to offer your fantasy team over the course of the 162-game marathon of a baseball season. </p>
<p> The Philadelphia Phillies’ pitching staff offers a wide range of fantasy outcomes for 2022. </p>
<p> We’ll begin by looking at the pitching staff and seeing just where you could expect to nab these players in your drafts, based on their projections for 2022. For drafting purposes, we will assume a 12-team, 23-round draft for a league that uses standard pitching categories (wins, saves, strikeouts, ERA, and WHIP). </p>
<p> Zach Wheeler </p>
<p> Few, if any, saw the kind of breakout season that Zack Wheeler had in 2021 coming. It was no doubt a career year, one that the Phillies unfortunately wasted, so you will have to pay a premium for his services this season. Wheeler was a top-30 starter heading into last year but has now bullied his way into the top-10. As such, you’ll have to be ready to use a late-second/early-third round pick to get him. There are some health concerns after he fell behind in his offseason throwing program, so be careful. But there are no sure things in fantasy baseball, so you might as well roll the dice with the expectation that he’ll be healthy and effective enough to give you a 3.50 ERA and around 200 strikeouts. </p>

<p> Philadelphia Phillies projected to set a new franchise home run record </p>
<p> Ryan Howard led the way with 45 followed by Jayson Werth with 36. The team also got 34 home runs from Raul Ibanez and another 31 from Chase Utley. Even Jimmy Rollins, a guy whose power fluctuated throughout his career, knocked 21 dingers. </p>
<p> The 2022 roster has something in common. They are also expected to round the bases a lot. In fact, according to FanGraphs’ Roster Resource, the projected Opening Day roster alone will hit more than 224. </p>
<p> How many home runs will the Philadelphia Phillies hit in 2022? </p>
<p> I added them all up. I ignored the guys who will get a sip of coffee. The total projected by Roster Resource is 232. </p>
<p> Returning sluggers Bryce Harper and Rhys Hoskins are projected to hit over 30. Newcomers Kyle Schwarber and Nick Castellanos will join them. Combined, these four Phillies could combine to hit about 130-140 of them. This doesn’t even include J.T. Realmuto who is usually good for about 20 or bounce-back campaigns from Didi Gregorius or Alec Bohm. Plus, there’s Bryson Stott to consider, too. </p>
<p> Home runs will obviously not make the Phillies a winning ball club. You need a full roster. You need to make sure your pitchers aren’t giving up just as many. If baseball was a Home Run Derby, the Phillies would be planning their parade right. Instead, they’re going to need to wait a couple of months to see how things shake out and hope their pitching can keep up. </p>
<p> One offensive record we won’t see the Phillies topple is the all-time runs scored total. Set way back in 1894, the 71-57-4 club scored 1179 times. Only the last-place 1930 team has come close since the world celebrated the switch into the 1900s. They scored 944 runs. </p>
<p> As far as modern totals are concerned, it’s actually not the 2009 Phillies this club should aim to replicate. The 2007 Phillies, with 892 runs scored, were a better offense. The 2009 club scored only 820 times—still one of the best in franchise history but fewer than even the 1999 and 2004 clubs. </p>
<p> The bleachers at Citizen’s Bank Ballpark will be a souvenir haven. Bring a hard hat. This team can swat them. </p>

<p> Preview: Nigeria vs. Ghana - prediction, team news, lineups </p>
<p> Sports Mole previews Tuesday's World Cup Qualifying - Africa clash between Nigeria and Ghana, including predictions, team news and possible lineups. </p>
<p> A place in the 2022 FIFA World Cup will be on the line on Tuesday when West African rivals Nigeria and Ghana square off at the M.K.O Abiola National Stadium. </p>
<p> Following Friday's draw Ghana have now failed to win any of their last five games across all competitions, while Nigeria have managed just one win in their last five home games. </p>
<p> Match preview </p>
<p> The spoils were a shared in an uneventful goalless draw when Ghana and Nigeria locked horns in the first-leg of their World Cup qualifying playoff tie last Friday. </p>
<p> In a drab contest at the Baba Yara Sports Stadium, both sides were guilty of a lethargic display and lack of cutting edge at the attacking end of the pitch as they settled for a draw, leaving all to play for on Tuesday. </p>
<p> Prior to that, the Super Eagles enjoyed a fine group-stage campaign, winning four and claiming one draw from six games to collect 13 points and finish top of Group C, two points above runners-up Cape Verde. </p>
<p> However, Nigeria now return to home soil where they have struggled to get going, claiming just two wins from their last nine games since 2019, while losing three and claiming four draws in that time. </p>
<p> Austine Eguavoen's men, who are currently 32nd in the latest FIFA World Rankings, will look to end this dry spell and equal Cameron's record for the most represented African nation in the history of the World Cup with seven appearances. </p>
<p> On the other hand, Friday's draw came fresh off the back of a disappointing run at the Africa Cup of Nations, where Ghana were dumped out in the group stages with just one point from three games. </p>
<p> Otto Addo's men have now failed to taste victory in any of their last five outings across all competitions, losing three and claiming two draws since a 1-0 victory over South Africa back in November. </p>
<p> However, the Black Stars head into Tuesday's game following a fine run in the group stages of the qualifiers, claiming 13 points from an available 18 to finish top of Group G and edge out South Africa on goal difference. </p>
<p> While they will look to cause an upset in Abuja and become one of five sides to head to Qatar later in the year, next up is an opposing side who they have failed to defeat in any of their previous five meetings between the sides, losing three and claiming two draws since a 1-0 victory back in 2006. </p>
<p> Team News </p>
<p> Following a toothless display in the final third last Friday, Eguavoen could make a few changes in attack, and one of them could be Leicester City man Ademola Lookman coming in for Moses Simon. </p>
<p> The 24-year-old, who came off the bench for his debut after recently switching nationalities, could team up with Emmanuel Dennis and fellow Leicester City teammate Kelechi Iheanacho all behind Napoli striker Victor Osimhen. </p>
<p> At the opposite end of the pitch, skipper and Watford defender William Troost-Ekong should make his 60th appearance for the Super Eagles, standing at the heart of the four-man defence and shielding Francis Uzoho between the sticks. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, Ghana will be boosted by the return of veteran forward and skipper Andre Ayew, who is now available for selection after missing the first leg through suspension. </p>
<p> We expect the 32-year-old to immediately return to the XI, starting alongside brother Jordan Ayew and Roma youngster Felix Afena-Gyan at the attacking end of the pitch. </p>
<p> Thomas Partey, who boasts 39 senior caps for the Black Stars, will once again anchor the midfield, teaming up with Ajax youngster Mohammed Kudus and Mallorca man Iddrisu Baba. </p>
<p> Nigeria possible starting lineup: Uzoho; Aina, Troost-Ekong, Balogun, Bassey; Onyeka, Aribo; Lookman, Iheanacho, Dennis; Osimhen </p>
<p> Ghana possible starting lineup: Wollacott; Mensah, Amartey, Djiku, Odoi; Partey, Baba, Kudus; J Ayew, Afena-Gyan, A Ayew </p>
<p> We say: Nigeria 1-0 Ghana </p>
<p> Nigeria will be counting on the support of their home crowd as they take on their close rivals Ghana for a place in Qatar. On paper, Nigeria head into the game as favourites to come away with the results as they boast a plethora of world-class talents across all department of the pitch. While we expect the Black Stars to cause an upset, we are tipping Nigeria to come away with the win, albeit by the odd goal. </p>

<p> Rafael Nadal to miss four to six weeks with stress fracture </p>
<p> Rafael Nadal announces that he will miss the next four to six weeks after suffering a stress fracture in his rib during the Indian Wells Masters. </p>
<p> Rafael Nadal has announced that he will spend four to six weeks out of action due to a stress fracture. </p>
<p> The 21-time Grand Slam winner was in visible discomfort during his Indian Wells Masters final against Taylor Fritz and had to receive treatment on the court during the 3-6 6-7 (5-7) defeat. </p>
<p> Nadal sustained the issue during his semi-final win over compatriot Carlos Alcaraz, and he is now set to sit out the Monte-Carlo Masters and Barcelona Open but should be fit to take part in the French Open in May. </p>
<p> "Hello everyone, I wanted to announce that I have returned to Spain and I immediately went to visit my medical team to do the tests after the Indian Wells final that I played with discomfort," Nadal posted on Twitter. </p>
<p> "As it turns out, I have a stress crack in one of my ribs and will be out for 4-6 weeks. This is not good news and I did not expect this. I am sunk and sad because after the start of the season I have had such a good time. </p>
<p> "I reached a very important part of the year with very good feelings and good results. But hey, I've always had that fighting and overcoming spirit and what I will do is be patient and work hard after my recovery. Once again thank everyone for the support." </p>
<p> Nadal's 20-match winning run came to an end in his final defeat to Fritz in California, and the Spaniard will aim to return in time for the Madrid Open, which begins on April 26. </p>

<p> Rangers are cash machines and Celtic bores are about to lose their favourite insult - Hotline </p>
<p> Craig Swan mans the lines as the big one on Sunday and Scotland's efforts are the big talking points. </p>
<p> Steve Clarke reckons Scotland can look forward with optimism after the final international break of the season. </p>
<p> The national coach saw his team follow up their 1-1 Hampden draw with Poland with a 2-2 draw against Austria in Vienna. </p>
<p> Scotland’s sights are now set on competitive matches again in June and most of the punters who contacted the Hotline are satisfied with what they are seeing. </p>
<p> Robert McCallum, Ratho, said: “It was a bit disappointing to be leading both of the games and then not winning any of the two, but, overall, it was fine. </p>
<p> “They were just friendlies and there were impressive aspects to take from both.” </p>
<p> Alan McCafferty, Aberdeen, added: “Scotland have lots to be excited about and I am convinced we are going to make it to the World Cup at the end of the year. </p>
<p> “That’s eight games unbeaten. I don’t care what country you are, that’s a good record and our young players are growing.” </p>
<p> However, you can’t please everyone and Mick Reid, Gretna , said: “That was sloppy from Scotland to chuck away a two-goal lead against a team who were saying goodbye to their manager and probably weren’t that bothered about the result. </p>

<p> “If it wasn’t for Craig Gordon’s saves, we would have lost. I’m not sure where all the positivity is coming from.” </p>
<p> In club matters, Sunday sees Rangers and Celtic go head-to-head at Ibrox in a top-of-the-table showdown in the Premiership. </p>
<p> Joe Hart will have a big role to play for the visitors and Eddie Easson, Ballingry, says the Englishman has proved old boss Nuno Espirito Santo to be well off the mark in saying he was finished at the top level. </p>
<p> He said: “So big Joe is too old, too slow and not strong enough according to NES. </p>
<p> "Don’t worry Joe, some said that about the Celtic team and defence the proof of the pudding is Celtic are top of the league with the best defence by a mile. Also you are going to work each day while Nuno is waiting for another chance.” </p>
<p> Strangely, the chance to go level at the top of the table did not see a lot of contact from their supporters to the Hotline. </p>
<p> John Bruce did get in touch about the old chestnut of the teams meeting in Australia at the end of the year in the proposed Sydney Sports Cup. </p>
<p> He said: “Whilst £3 million for a game in Australia would be a nice little earner, one point seems to have been lost in the clamour to justify the game from some of the Rangers fans on here, especially those who claim that we need the money. </p>
<p> “And that is the not so insignificant matter of up to £20 million that the club has already banked for the team’s amazing Europa League run. When the TV money and income from sell-out home games is factored in, this figure will be much higher if Rangers go further in the competition. </p>
<p> “So the club is far from desperate for the money and the fans are far from desperate for it to go ahead. £3 million or not.” </p>
<p> Elsewhere, Alan McPherson, Cullen , spoke up for Buckie Thistle and said: “In reply to Dougie Lawrence, I couldn’t agree more with his comment regarding Thistle’s record breaking Highland league against Deveronvale. </p>
<p> “As my beloved Aberdeen didn’t have a game, my mate and I attended the game. We were treated to a great game, beautiful weather, lovely half time pie and bovril at a fraction of the cost at top league grounds add to this a delicious ice cream after. </p>
<p> “Last but not least the admission price of £5. Altogether a great day and a great advert for the Highland League.” </p>

<p> RANKED: Mid-competition grades for every Six Nations team </p>
<p> March 8, 2022 c_admin Rugby Comments Off on RANKED: Mid-competition grades for every Six Nations team </p>
<p> We’re just over midway point of the 2022 Six Nations, meaning now is a good time to reflect on the first half of the campaign and dish out some grades. </p>
<p> From teams starting fast and floundering to others building momentum slowly, it has been a crazy first half of the 2022 Six Nations. </p>
<p> Riveting? Yes. Fun? Absolutely. Predictable? Anything but. </p>
<p> #6. Italy – E </p>
<p> An awful tournament so far with captain Michele Lamaro’s leadership and performances being the only reason they didn’t get an F. </p>
<p> #5. Scotland – D </p>
<p> A very poor year so far for the Scots. Despite a positive Autumn and a stuttering win against England in round one, Gregor Townsend’s side are struggling to play their usually attractive brand of rugby with senior players Finn Russell and Stuart Hogg underperforming while Jonny Gray and Jamie Ritchie are out injured. With Italy still to come, could they go from contenders to the wooden spoon? It’s Scotland so you never know. </p>

<p> Arsenal were hit by a stoppage-time equaliser as AZ Alkmaar earned a draw in tonight's Champions League Group H clash. • Wenger: We were naive Cesc Fabregas' first-half strike had looked to be enough to secure a third straight European victory, which would have all but secured Arsenal a place in the knockout stages. However, the Dutch side, managed by Ronald Koeman, refused to give up and snatched a point at the death through Mendes Da Silva. The fact AZ remained resilient should have come as no surprise given they had previously lost just once at home in Europe, against Everton two years ago, from 34 games. Off the field, however, the Dutch club have some financial worries after owner Dirk Scheringa was declared bankrupt, the immediate impact of which was the team playing without shirt sponsors. In stark contrast to their last European away game, when going 2-0 down inside five minutes at Liege, Arsenal were quickly on the offensive. Van Persie, who netted in his fourth straight game against Birmingham on Saturday, charged at the centre of the AZ defence but was barged off possession by Niklas Moisander. On eight minutes, Abou Diaby broke down the right, and whipped the ball back towards the far post, where Van Persie brought it down and drilled a shot goalwards, which Argentina international Sergio Romero gathered at the second attempt. The hosts continued to enjoy good possession, but without a cutting edge in the final third. AZ created their first decent opening on 26 minutes when Moussa Dembele fed Mounir El Hamdaoui on the edge of the Arsenal area, and the former Tottenham striker fired his shot just over. Emmanuel Eboue was put clear down the right channel, and sent over a first-time cross which Andrey Arshavin met at the far post before floating it back over the goalkeeper but onto the roof of the net. Arsenal finally got it right after 35 minutes when Fabregas swept them ahead. Alex Song intercepted a stray pass from Moisander, before feeding Arshavin who put Van Persie in on the left side of the penalty area. Unselfishly, the Dutchman drew the goalkeeper, before squaring to Fabregas who slotted home. Arsenal suddenly looked a much more cohesive outfit, with Arshavin finding more space down the left. Fabregas curled an effort goalwards from 20 yards, but it was straight at the AZ goalkeeper. Romero then spilled an 18-yard shot from Van Persie, but luckily the ball flew wide. Arsenal continued to press at the start of the second half. Eboue was tripped by Hector Moreno 25 yards out in a central position. Van Persie whipped the free-kick around the wall, but Romero was down quickly to make a fine save. Arsenal's Dutch frontman felt he should have had a penalty when turning on the goalline between two AZ defenders - but Swedish referee Martin Hansson was not interested. Arsenal remained in control, with Song breaking up possession ahead of the back four. Van Persie was allowed the space to run at the AZ defence, but blazed over from the edge of the penalty area. There was, however, a let-off for Arsenal on 72 minutes when a corner deflected off Diaby and onto the top of the crossbar. Van Persie was given a rest when Mexican striker Carlos Vela came on. A free-kick then caused chaos in the Arsenal six-yard box, but Moreno was not able to convert. Vela looked to have a strong penalty claim denied when he appeared to be tripped by Kew Jaliens after darting in from the left channel. Arshavin saw a low shot saved by Romero. Just as Arsenal looked to have done enough, AZ snatched a dramatic equaliser in time added on, when Mendes Da Silva blasted in from close range after Moreno's ball into the box had been flicked on by substitute Graziano Pelle. </p>

<p> Ricardo Gomes Vilana (61) · Club Squads: Rangers Unirea Urziceni Updated: October 21, 2009, 8:02 AM UKRangers' Champions League aspirations are in tatters after an embarrassing defeat to Unirea Urziceni at Ibrox. • Petrescu: We've still got another level A second 4-1 home European defeat in succession leaves Rangers bottom of Group G with one point from three games and facing the return game in Romania in a fortnight knowing only a victory will do. On the evidence of this match, few would countenance that prospect. Pedro Mendes' second-minute drive, which took a deflection off Unirea midfielder Ricardo Vilana before going in, gave the home side the perfect start. However, in a bizarre night of football in Govan, the Light Blues proceeded to concede four goals, two of them own goals, while missing a penalty at 1-1. After Marius loan Bilasco equalised just after the half-hour mark, Steven Davis had a spot-kick saved by Unirea keeper Daniel Tudor. Half-time substitute Kyle Lafferty, on for Mendes, helped a Bruno Fernandes flick past Allan McGregor and into his own net before Lee McCulloch left his McGregor stranded with a header just before the hour mark. More woe followed when Pablo Brandan made it four to send the home fans heading to the exits with 25 minutes remaining. More than 1,000 members of the Armed Forces had been given free tickets to the game and it was a night they are unlikely to forget either. Although Ibrox was short of capacity, the atmosphere was cranked up after Mendes collected a Jerome Rothen corner at the edge of the box and drove towards goal, happy to see the ball take a significant deflection off Vilana before looping over Tudor. However, instead of inspiring Rangers, the fortuitous goal was followed by a nervy period in which the visitors were allowed to play their way into the game. With Unirea pressing high up the park, the Light Blues struggled to escape the confines of their own half. There was the occasional flurry in the visiting box but in the 32nd minute Unirea deservedly drew level with a fine goal by striker Bilasco. Midfielder Iulian Apostol split the Ibrox defence to send Brandan into the box and his cut-back from the left was easily slid in to the empty net by Bilasco. Five minutes later Rangers had the chance to retain their lead when Fernandes was adjudged by referee Eric Braamhaar to have handled a David Weir header, following a looping Rothen free-kick into a packed penalty area. Davis struck the penalty to Tudor's right and watched in dismay as the goalkeeper dived to push the ball behind for a corner. Lafferty replaced Mendes at the break but the Irishman's first real involvement was five minutes later when he helped the visitors take the lead. When Apostol's low cross was delivered into the box, Fernandes flicked the ball on and it took the slightest of touches off the luckless Northern Ireland international before it sped past McGregor and in off the post. It was all going horribly wrong for Walter Smith's men and more trouble soon followed. The boos rang out around Ibrox in the 59th minute when McCulloch headed a Brandan free-kick past McGregor to make it 3-1, and many Rangers supporters simply upped and left in disgust when Brandan fired in a 30-yard drive after taking a short free-kick from Apostol. The rest of the game was played in a mixture of frustration and stunned silence until the final whistle, when the home fans revealed their unhappiness in no uncertain terms. Rangers now have to somehow regroup, first of all for the SPL game against Hibernian on Saturday before they think of trying to salvage a European campaign which is unravelling game by game. Petrescu: We've still got another level Unirea manager Dan Petrescu, the former Chelsea player, suggested his team had not performed well for much of the match. "After we scored the third the game was over - but before that, I thought we could have done better," Petrescu said. "We must be very happy now. "We conceded an early goal and had to change the system. I thought if they scored a second it would be difficult to come back. Now we have to think about the next game, because it's going to be a different game in Romania.'' Petrescu was pleased with the victory but said: "It's going to be big if we qualify. If we don't win it's not that big.'' Rangers captain David Weir is hoping Walter Smith's team can make amends in their next European match after slumping to a 4-1 defeat against Unirea Urziceni. "We're obviously very disappointed with the way it's gone tonight," Weir told Sky Sports. "We've got to try to win the next game - it's as simple as that. We've got to win the next game and see where that takes us.'' Weir admits he was "very disappointed'' with the outcome at Ibrox, which prompted much booing of the home side - while many supporters left long before the final whistle. "It's their prerogative; if they want to leave and boo that's their decision,'' Weir said </p>
<p> Fiorentina edged a seven-goal thriller against Debrecen in Budapest to keep up the chase of Lyon at the top of Group E. Peter Czvitkovics opened the scoring in the second minute, but two goals from Adrian Mutu and an Alberto Gilardino strike turned the game on its head before 20 minutes had even been played. • Prandelli: I predicted Mutu would be special Gergely Rudolf reduced the arrears once again in the 28th minute, but Mario Santana restored Fiorentina's two-goal cushion in the 37th minute before Adamo Coulibaly made it a nervous ending for the Italians with his side's third in the 88th minute. Debrecen, who had yet to score in the Champions League this season, got off to a flying start with Czvitkovics breaking their duck with just over a minute on the clock. He took advantage of some sleepy Fiorentina defending to convert Zoltan Kiss' cross to catch Fiorentina out cold. They soon warmed up, though, and were level four minutes later. Centre-back Dario Dainelli had stayed up following a free-kick and he found himself in the right place to retrieve a loose ball inside the penalty area which he sent back into the danger zone where Mutu hit a side-footed volley past Vukasin Poleksic from eight yards. The Viola were gaining momentum and Gilardino put them ahead in the 10th minute. The crossbar was still rattling after Juan Vargas' shot moments earlier when the ball came back into the Debrecen penalty area where Mutu squared the ball intelligently to Gilardino, who took his time to settle before picking his spot in the corner. Back at the other end, Coulibaly had a chance similar to the one Mutu scored, but his sidefoot volley went wide of the far post. Fiorentina were now on fire and they extended their lead in the 20th minute. Gilardino did what he does best with his back to goal after winning a few fortunate rebounds and he laid the ball into the path of Mutu, who arrowed a shot in off the inside of the post from 20 yards out. However, Debrecen hit back in the 28th minute with a fine individual goal from Rudolf, who cut in from the left and curled his shot over Sebastien Frey into the far top corner of the goal Fiorentina had to attack again and they restored their two-goal cushion in the 37th minute thanks to Santana. Marco Donadel sent Manuel Pasqual free down the left wing and his cross was diverted towards goal by Mutu, but Poleksic made an instinctive save. He could not hold the ball, though, and it rebounded to Santana, who sent it back into the bottom left-hand corner of the goal. It appeared there would be even more goals in the second half when Donadel's free-kick almost slipped in as Poleksik could only save with his leg after being blinded by his wall. The Hungarians then looked for a response as Fiorentina began packing men behind the ball to protect their lead. Coulibaly only found the outside of the net in the 77th minute before spurning a one-on-one opportunity five minutes later as Frey stood his ground. But Coulibaly was rewarded for his persistence with his side's third with just two minutes remaining as he raced in to send a bullet header past Frey from a right-wing free-kick. Prandelli: I predicted Mutu would be special Fiorentina coach Cesare Prandelli praised Mutu's ability to lift his teammates. "Mutu produced a top-draw performance which obviously helps the team to play at a higher level. I knew he was going to do something extra after his approach and work in recent weeks," Prandelli said. Debrecen coach Andras Herczeg bemoaned his side's failure to secure a point despite breaching the Fiorentina defence on so many occasions. "If someone had told me before the game we would score three goals and not get a point I would not have believed it," Herczeg told reporters. var activeLeague = "UEFA.CHAMPIONS" Jump To Scores -- UEFA Champions LeagueEnglish League ChampionshipJohnstone's Paint TrophyEnglish ConferenceLeague of Ireland Premier DivisionCONCACAF Champions LeaguePrimera División de HondurasCopa Sudamericana Tuesday, October 20, 2009 Debrecen 3 Fiorentina 4 FT Liverpool 1 Lyon 2 FT Barcelona 1 FK Rubin Kazan 2 FT Internazionale 2 Dynamo Kiev 2 FT Rangers 1 Unirea Urziceni 4 FT VfB Stuttgart 1 Sevilla FC 3 FT AZ Alkmaar 1 Arsenal 1 FT Olympiakos 2 Standard Liege 1 FT </p>

<p> Aldo Duscher (79) · Club Squads: VfB Stuttgart Sevilla FC Updated: October 21, 2009, 8:49 AM UKSevilla recorded a third successive victory, at the expense of Stuttgart, to continue their perfect start in Champions League Group G. The Spaniards were three up after a goal in each half by Sebastien Squillaci and one from Jesus Navas, and substitute Elson's sweetly-struck free-kick for the hosts was mere consolation. • Babbel: Silly mistakes cost us After a quiet opening, Sevilla threatened for the first time just before the quarter-hour mark when Luis Fabiano's right-footed shot from inside the penalty area was blocked by Khalid Boulahrouz. The table-toppers went in front when Squillaci met Adriano Correia's cross with a firm header into the top right corner in the 23rd minute. Long-range shots from Alexander Hleb and Cacau - the first wide, the second comfortably saved - were the highlights of Stuttgart's response before half-time. Correia, such an important contributor in the build-up to Sevilla's goal, had to go off injured nine minutes before the break and was replaced in the midfield by Diego Perotti. Stuttgart, meanwhile, continued to press - dominating possession and territory without reward in front of goal. Navas rose above the mediocrity of a scrappy opening to the second half, first with a 12-yard shot which flashed just wide and then with Sevilla's second goal in the 55th minute when he was on hand with a right-foot finish from close range after Jens Lehmann had dropped Perotti's cross. Stuttgart boss Markus Babbel made three substitutions in the 69th minute - Elson, Pavel Pogrebniak and Thomas Hitzlsperger coming on for Hleb, Cacau and Christian Trasch respectively in the 69th minute. The immediate consequence was another blow to home aspirations when Squillaci added his second and Seville's third goal, heading in from six yards on the end of Ivica Dragutinovic's free-kick. But Elson did soon make his presence felt with an unstoppable right-footed free-kick from 30 yards which gave goalkeeper Herrera Javi Varas no chance in the 73rd minute. Elson was soon in the action again, first with an inswinging corner which Varas had to punch clear under pressure and then an overhead shot just clearing the bar. Zdravko Kuzmanovic went even closer in the 83rd minute - with a left-footer which Varas had to tip over the bar. In the end, though, it was all too little too late. Babbel: Silly mistakes cost us Stuttgart coach Markus Babbel bemoaned the errors that cost his side in what was otherwise a good performance. "We are making far too many silly mistakes," said Babbel, who is finding things much harder in his second season at the club. "But the result tonight and the performance do not match. I think we had a good game." Sevilla coach Manolo Jimenez was delighted to maintain a rare perfect record after three games. "Team solidarity won today," Jimenez told reporters. "Stuttgart dominated the first half and we knew we had to be patient. The team read the match very well." </p>

Taras Mykhalyk put Dynamo in front and after Dejan Stankovic had equalised, Ferreira Lucio headed into his own net to give the visitors a 2-1 half-time lead. Walter Samuel equalised less than two minutes into the second half but neither side was able to find a winner despite a number of chances. The visitors took a shock lead after just four minutes courtesy of a superb opportunist finish from Mykhalyk. Junior Gerson Magrao's woeful free-kick should have been cleared by any of the three Inter players on the edge of the area, but somehow found its way through to Mykhalyk and he swept the ball into the bottom corner off the post. Inter were struggling to get anything going in attack and Wesley Sneijder's abysmal free-kick summed up their early efforts. Samuel Eto'o then felt he should have had a penalty when he collided with Yevhen Khacheridi as he ran into the area but referee Martin Atkinson was unmoved. Dejan Stankovic then flashed a shot wide before becoming the first player booked for a foul on Magrao, but it was Dynamo who really should have got on the scoresheet again on 25 minutes. Roman Eremenko produced a superb cross and Andriy Shevchenko climbed highest between two Inter defenders only to steer his header inches wide of the post. It took until the 30th minute for Inter to force visiting goalkeeper Stanislav Bogush into a genuine save, Dynamo failing to clear a free-kick and Stankovic connecting with a stinging half-volley which Bogush gratefully parried clear at his near post. Stankovic would not be denied for long however, the home side getting back on level terms in the 35th minute with a rapid counterattack. Sneijder and Ferreira Lucio combined to free Stankovic and his task was made considerably easier as Bogush charged out of the area, leaving Stankovic to flick the ball into an empty net with the outside of his right foot. However, Dynamo took the lead again just five minutes later when Lucio inexplicably headed into his own net from Magrao's corner. Whatever manager Jose Mourinho said at half-time had the desired effect and Inter equalised again less than two minutes into the second half. Sneijder's outswinging corner was met by Walter Samuel and superbly headed into the far corner from a difficult angle. The game had really opened up as both sides were not happy to settle for a draw, Eto'o forcing a good save from Bogush and Julio Cesar needing to scamper quickly from his line moments later at the other end to snuff out a Dynamo attack. Shevchenko's free-kick was comfortably saved by Cesar at his near post before Eto'o dithered too long on the edge of the area, only to scuff a weak shot straight at Bogush. The best chance of a winner fell to Inter substitute David Suazo, who was found five yards from goal by Javier Zanetti's brilliant cutback, only to somehow miss the target when it looked easier to score. Suazo did have the ball in the net in injury time but was correctly ruled offside. </p>

<p> Anthony Reveillere (90) · Club Squads: Liverpool Lyon Updated: October 21, 2009, 8:01 AM UKLiverpool conceded an injury-time goal which puts their Champions League future in grave doubt. • Benitez: Gerrard start was no gamble• Harris: Liverpool sink further into the mire• Jolly: Problems mounting at Anfield An injury-ravaged home side had produced a display of spirit and effort which did not deserve to see them finish as losers. But they have now lost four games in succession for the first time since 1987 as their season plunges into despair. Captain Steven Gerrard's groin problem forced him off in the first half, as Liverpool lost this Group E match to a side who now top the group with nine points. Liverpool led at the break through Yossi Benayoun, but Lyon slowly edged their way towards victory with goals from substitutes Maxime Gonalons and Cesar Delgado. An air of nervous tension hung over Anfield, such were the levels of distress from fans unused to their side losing with such regularity. The beach-ball embarrassment of the defeat at Sunderland just about summed up Liverpool's indifferent season. Their form has been poor, a situation made worse by having their squad systematically deprived of its best players. Fernando Torres was again out, while Glen Johnson was missing with a groin injury. At least Gerrard was back - but that lasted only 25 minutes. Teenager Martin Kelly, Whiston-born and academy produced, made his full debut at right-back, having had just a handful of minutes prior to this as a late substitute against PSV Eindhoven in Holland last December in this competition. Facing them were a clever, experienced team - full of neat passing, solid possession and pacy movement which threatened a fragile Liverpool. It needed a close-range save from Jose Reina to keep out a powerful header from Argentina striker Lisandro before patched-up Liverpool - who had David Ngog in Torres' role - continually wasted possession. Former Liverpool and Lyon boss Gerard Houllier watched from the directors' box as the Reds struggled, while co-owner George Gillett was also in the posh seats, fresh from his trip to Saudi Arabia. And there were signs of Liverpool defiance, a Dirk Kuyt headed disallowed for offside from Gerrard's deep cross. That was virtually the only contribution from the skipper, who trudged off to be replaced by Fabio Aurelio. The groin injury sustained on England duty had given way again. It needed a performance of defiance, spirit and sheer desire from Liverpool to survive this. And there were signs to warm the Kop. Defender Cris was booked for a foul on Kuyt, the Dutchman's knee crashing into his head as he fell. The Brazilian did not last much longer, carried off in a daze. Liverpool were beginning to show genuine fight now, and somehow France number two 'keeper Hugo Lloris kept out an Ngog effort after fine work by Kelly, Kuyt and Aurelio. Aurelio had a powerful header saved by Lloris' left-hand from Kelly's run and cross, before Liverpool took a 41st minute lead. Benayoun showed calmness to lift the ball over Lloris from eight yards, after Aurelio's cross evaded Kelly in the six-yard box. Ngog was booked for a foul on Jeremy Toulalan, then Lyon skipper Sidney Govou was cautioned for flattening Emiliano Insua. Benayoun, with a fine header, and Ngog - from eight-yards - could have stretched Liverpool's lead in the second period, while Lloris needed to be at full stretch to keep out Kuyt's header from Aurelio's cross. Lyon sent on striker Bafetimbi Gomis to partner Lisandro in place of Ederson - and they began to stretch Liverpool. Bosnian teenager Miralem Pjanic, followed relentlessly by Lucas, was starting to find space to produce the sort of tricks which have helped his country into the World Cup play-offs. The pressure increased and Lyon equalised in the 72nd minute. Liverpool failed to clear a corner, Reina made two outstanding saves from Toulalan and Govou before the ball reached substitute Gonalons, who dived to head home. The hosts then lost young Kelly with an ankle injury, with Martin Skrtel taking over in a defence under increasing pressure. Benitez sent on Andriy Voronin for Benayoun, to boos from the Kop, as Liverpool searched for a second. But the decider came in injury-time from substitute Cesar Delgado, arriving at the far post to sidefoot past Reina from Govou's cross. Benitez: Gerrard start was no gamble Rafael Benitez insisted he did not take an unwise gamble on Steven Gerrard's fitness in tonight's 2-1 Champions League defeat at home to Lyon. "It was not a gamble to play Gerrard," Benitez said. "He wanted to play and had trained normally for two games. "He was given the all-clear by the doctor, and what happened was just bad luck. He felt something wrong in his groin, and it was wise to come off.'' Benitez will tomorrow oversee a succession of scans for his injured stars before being able to start preparation for Sunday's visit of Premier League champions Manchester United. Liverpool have staged miracle survivals in the group stages of Europe before - and will need another one now. Benitez recalled: "We have come back before - and we can do it again. We now must be ready for the next match. I have confidence that we have the quality to overcome these problems. "We have to push players now, to keep working and to maintain our confidence. We just had too many problems before and during the game. Losing Glen Johnson before the match, and then Gerrard and Martin Kelly during the match, was just too much to contend with. "It was a difficult game with all our problems, and we had done well to be leading at the break. Then we had two or three chances soon after the interval. Had we scored, it would have changed everything.'' Benitez also explained his decision to take off Benayoun and send on Andriy Voronin in the closing stages - a choice that was booed by the Kop. "The fans know Yossi is a good player, but I felt he was getting a little tired and I wanted to use some fresh legs,'' he said. We needed to change something, to put a fresher man on - and it was a chance worth taking.'' Captain Jamie Carragher insisted Liverpool would bounce back after a fourth straight defeat in all competitions at home to Lyon. Carragher told Sky Sports: "It's a massive disappointment, a bad result which leaves us a lot to do. We're going through a tough patch but we've been through them before, we will come through no doubt. "We have great fight and character. We had a lot of young lads out there tonight, if we could have hung on (for a draw) it would have been a good result.'' Despite their poor run, Carragher feels facing Barclays Premier League leaders United at Anfield could be the ideal fixture. "It's always a great game, they are a top side,'' he added. "That could be the game we need.'' Lyon chief Claude Puel was delighted with his side's victory, having had Brazilian defender Cris carried off in the second half with concussion. "Cris has had scans on his head. He was unconscious, but he has improved. Despite that problem, it was an excellent performance. It was a tough match, decided by fine details. "They put us under a lot of pressure with crosses and high balls into the box, and they took the lead. But we kept our organisation and our shape, and slowly maintained more possession. "We were the better side in the second period - and we deserved the win. But I do not believe we have already qualified. Liverpool will have to win when they come to Lyon in a fortnight - that will be a very hard game for us, because Liverpool will be going for it and attacking.'' </p>
<p> Rubin Kazan pulled off one of the greatest shocks in Champions League history by beating champions Barcelona 2-1 at a stunned Nou Camp. </p>
<p> GettyImages Rubin players celebrate their win as Barcelona despair Aleksandr Ryazantsev's blockbuster put the Russian side ahead within two minutes before Zlatan Ibrahimovic levelled with a precise finish just after the break. But Karadeniz Gökdeniz fired Rubin back in front after good work from Alejandro Dominguez. Barca pressed for an equaliser and though Ibrahimovic hit the post right at the death Rubin held on for a famous victory. The other match in Group F saw Inter Milan held to a 2-2 draw by Dynamo Kiev as their winless run in the Champions League stretched to eight games. Taras Mikhalik gave Kiev the lead on five minutes but Dejan Stankovic drew Jose Mourinho's side level half an hour later. A Lucio own goal gave Dynamo the lead again but Walter Samuel ensured Inter a point. In Group E Liverpool lost 2-1 to Lyon in injury-time to put their Champions League future in grave doubt. Rafa Benitez's side have now lost four games in succession for the first time since 1987. Liverpool led at the break after Yossi Benayoun stabbed home at the far post, but Lyon slowly edged their way towards victory with goals from substitutes Maxime Gonalons and Cesar Delgado. Fiorentina edged a seven-goal thriller against Debrecen thanks to a superb Adrian Mutu performance. Peter Czvitkovics put the Hungarians ahead inside two minutes but Mutu scored two and set another up for Alberto Gilardino as La Viola netted three times in 14 minutes. Gergely Rudolf made it 3-2 on 28 minutes before Mario Santana put Viola 4-2 up nine minutes later. Adamo Coulibaly's late goal gave Debrecen hope but Fiorentina held on. Arsenal were hit by a stoppage-time equaliser as AZ Alkmaar earned a draw in their Group H clash. Cesc Fabregas' put Arsenal in front after neat interplay between Andrey Arshavin and Robin van Persie, but Mendes Da Silva smashed home from a free-kick knockdown to rescue a point for Ronald Koeman's side. A late winner from Ieroklis Stoltidis gave Olympiakos a 2-1 win over Standard Liege in the group's other game. Konstantinos Mitroglou had given the Greek side the lead before Igor De Camargo pulled Liege level. In Group G Rangers were humiliated by Urinea Urziceni who inflicted a second 4-1 Champions League defeat in succession at Ibrox. Rangers took the lead after just two minutes when Ricardo Gomes Vilana deflected Pedro Mendes' shot into his own net but Marius Bilasco equalised. Steven Davis then had a penalty saved before Kyle Lafferty and Lee McCulloch put through their own net. Pablo Brandán added a fourth for Dan Petrescu's side. Sevilla essentially secured qualification for the next stage with a comfortable 3-1 win at Stuttgart. The Spanish side, who are just one win away from advancing, went three up courtesy of two goals from Sebastien Squillaci and one from Jesus Navas. Elson grabbed a consolation for Stuttgart. </p>

<p> Wales boss Rob Page insists he has no fears over the sharpness of star duo Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey ahead of the upcoming World Cup play-off semi-final with Austria. </p>
<p> Both players have been named in Page's 26-man squad (You can read about the squad in full here ) and are likely to once again be at the heart of their side's hopes at a sold-out Cardiff City Stadium next week, despite a worrying lack of game time this season. </p>
<p> Bale has played just 74 minutes of senior football since the last international camp, while Ramsey has made two starts for Rangers since his loan move from Juventus in January. Ramsey's spell in Scotland has largely been hampered by fitness issues and niggling injuries, but Page has no doubts over the midfielder's fitness ahead of next Thursday's clash. </p>
<p> However, he admits he will check in with Ibrox boss Giovanni van Bronkhorst before the players meet up for this latest camp. </p>
<p> "Me and Aaron have been in constant contact," he said. "I've not spoken to the manager. I've spoken with Aaron and I trust in my medical team that have been in contact with Rangers' medical team and that's what's important to us. </p>
<p> "There's no lying. The numbers are there in terms of what he's been doing and how he's been training. But I will be in contact with the manager. Up to now I haven't been but before I meet up on camp I absolutely will be, yeah. </p>
<p> "He chose Rangers in the window because he wanted to play games, and for whatever reason he hasn't played as many minutes as he'd like. But I know Aaron's got to an age now where he looks after his body really well. So I'm not worried about that. </p>
<p> "I know he'll be training right. I know he'll be fully prepared. he's proved it in the past. He's had similar circumstances where he's not played domestic football and come on camp and smashed two games back to back. Both away. Tough physical games. So I'm not concerned." </p>
<p> Page has similarly dismissed concerns over Bale, who barring any injury problems will be one of the first names on the teamsheet next week, but admits that in an ideal world both players would be playing more regularly for their respective clubs. </p>
<p> "They’re big players for us, of course they are," Page replied when pressed on the duo. "We want them playing games coming into camp, of course. The good thing is they’re fit. I’ve had a great conversation with both of them. They’re raring to go, fit and they can’t wait to get on camp. </p>
<p> "They have done it time and time again. I don’t think we’ve had a camp where we’ve had all the starting XI playing domestic football the weekend before. It is not unusual for us. We’ll get that preparation right, they’ll have their individual programmes to make sure that come Thursday they’re in peak condition. </p>
<p> "Big players turn up for big games and they’ve proven that over time. The other way of looking at it is they’ll be fresh and raring to go." </p>
<p> Meanwhile, Page has been left raving by the progress of exciting youngster Neco Williams, who's enjoyed a rich run of form at Fulham following a recent loan from Premier League giants Liverpool. </p>
<p> Page was in attendance to watch Williams and team-mate Harry Wilson in action for the current Championship leaders against Barnsley at Oakwell on Saturday, in a game that saw the latter net a stunning late equaliser. Williams too has caught the eye in front of goal, netting a brace in the 5-1 win over Swansea City recently, and Page believes the full-back has made the right decision in seeking game time away from Anfield. </p>
<p> "It's been a great move for both players," Page added. "It's a great club for them both to be at. They're full of confidence and the way they play suits both players, and I think we're going to reap the rewards of that. </p>
<p> "Great for Neco to make that decision. He had to be brave and strong and say to Liverpool 'I'm not happy just sitting in the squad', where he's training with world class players day in day out. He wants to play week in, week out, and I've got nothing but respect for him for doing that and he'll benefit from having that experience. </p>
<p> "I thought Neco, in the last camp against Belgium, went to another level. He was playing on the left, as opposed to playing on the right where he plays for Fulham just behind Harry, but you can play him anywhere on the pitch. He's full of enthusiasm. He wants to improve and he wants to play for his country. </p>
<p> "When you've got that, you've got a recipe for success. He's in good form and that's really encouraging for me." </p>

<p> The latest international rugby news, from the most interesting sources, all in one place. </p>
<p> There was controversy, thrills 'n' spills and intense media interest at Murrayfield this afternoon. And that was just at the National Trust for Scotland's AGM in the President's Suite. The Embra-Leinster match up that followed was right up with the best in a series where high drama has been a feature of many. A brilliant Sexton dropped goal with seconds left secured the points for the visitors after a long Paterson penalty had seemed to win it for Edinburgh. Yet Mossy could so nearly have won it yet, a final long range penalty just going wide with no time left on the clock. </p>
<p> Can we try and confirm exact numbers on Saturday. Can you come up and see me with a list of names against all the tickets you requested so that we can check duplication. If possible can you get to the Clubhouse (Presidents Suite) before the start of the game.Also, any comments on contributions / donations for tickets ( 10 or 15 have been suggested). If we decide I would want to collect money on Saturday also. All money raised will re ring-fenced for buying tickets for SFSC fans fo the return leg. There have been suggestions made about a meeting </p>
<p> The Edinburghgunners.org website has this week struggled to cope with the early season excitement, crashing for a few days under the weight of public expectation. But the squad have taken it in their stride, kept their feet on the ground etc etc. They did so again this evening at Ravenhill with a tight win in a nailbiting finish. The last three meetings between the two sides have seen the losers emerge with a bonus point, so perhaps this was no surprise. Embra brought home the points with the aid of a second half shutout of the home side, a doughty defensive </p>
<p> The New York Yankees and prized Japanese pitcher Masahiro Tanaka agreed Wednesday to a $155 million, seven-year contract. </p>

<p> Rugby in New Zealand Is Back. So Are 35,000 Fans. </p>
<p> In New Zealand, spectators are ready to pack rugby stadiums. Plus, the long-term ripple effects of coronavirus on global sporting events. </p>
<p> Send any friend a story </p>

<p> This weekend, rugby union in New Zealand will make its return. And there will be one crucial difference from many of the other leagues that have been resuming play around the world: The stands will be packed with fans. </p>
<p> Some 20,000 fans are expected to be on hand in Dunedin when the Highlanders host the Chiefs, the first Super League game since mid-March. Then, on Sunday, in Auckland, the Blues are expecting 35,000 for their game against the Highlanders. </p>
<p> Covid-19 is almost entirely under control in the New Zealand, thanks in part to an early and strict lockdown. There are currently no active cases in New Zealand, and, in total, there were 1,500 cases in the country and 22 deaths. The country largely opened up its society on Monday, including stores, restaurants and public transportation. </p>
<p> The Blues are doing nothing to discourage fans, and are making every effort to have the biggest crowd possible. Tickets are discounted, children will be admitted free and fans will be allowed on the field after the game. </p>
<p> Should they reach 35,000 fans, as they hope, it would be the biggest crowd at a Blues home game since 2011. That would be “an amazing result and will make for a fantastic atmosphere and a lift for the players,” the Blues’ chief executive, Andrew Hore, told The New Zealand Herald. </p>
<p> The country does continue to have travel restrictions, meaning its five Super Rugby teams, which normally also play against teams from Australia, South Africa, Japan and Argentina, will stick to domestic games for now. </p>
<p> Australian rules football also gets underway this weekend, though Australia is not quite ready for full stadiums yet. But some 2,000 fans will be allowed into the stands for a game between the Port Adelaide Power and the Adelaide Crows. Other games will have no fans, including the opener between the Richmond Tigers and the Collingwood Magpies, which under normal conditions would have drawn 80,000 to Melbourne Cricket Ground. </p>
<p> Australia, with a population five times that of New Zealand, has had 7,000 cases and 100 deaths. But its rate of new infections is down to about 20 a day. </p>
<p> Ripple Effects on the Women’s World Cup </p>
<p> The coronavirus pandemic has transformed the sports landscape drastically this year. But its effects are also rippling forward, altering events in 2021 and beyond. </p>
<p> Brazil, the spiritual home of soccer, was a candidate to host the women’s World Cup in 2023 for the first time. But citing the economic effects of the virus, Brazil pulled out of the bidding on Monday. </p>
<p> The Brazilian government decided that “due to the scenario of economic and fiscal austerity, fueled by the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, it would not be advisable, at this moment” to proceed with a bid, the national federation said in a statement. </p>
<p> Brazil has been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, with more than 700,000 cases and 30,000 deaths reported. </p>
<p> The federation also said that because the country had hosted many major events in the recent past, including the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016, it might be at a disadvantage in the voting in any case. </p>
<p> Brazil says it now plans to support the bid of Colombia. Japan and a joint bid by Australia and New Zealand are also still in the mix for the event. All the candidates would be first-time hosts. </p>
<p> Some Cancellations Continue in Auto Racing </p>
<p> Unlike other forms of auto racing, which mostly have restarted or are gearing up to do so, the World Rally Championship continues to cancel its events deep into the fall. The latest event to be scrapped is the Wales Rally GB, scheduled to start Oct. 29. </p>
<p> After the first three rallies of the year, the season was halted. For now, just three events remain on the schedule. </p>
<p> One reason rallying is different is that races are frequently run over public roads, making crowd limitation difficult or impossible. Fans are known to cluster in groups right by the action; in the past, that has sometimes led to serious danger to spectators from the speeding cars. Now that danger could possibly include transmission of the coronavirus. </p>
<p> “This isn’t the appropriate time for us to be planning for and promoting an event that brings tens of thousands of visitors, many from outside the country, into rural Welsh communities,” said David Richards, chairman of Motorsport U.K. </p>
<p> The Wales Rally had previously been canceled because of World War II, the Suez Crisis (which led to gas rationing) and foot-and-mouth disease. </p>

<p> Saudi Arabian GP: FIA, F1 Release Joint Statement Post Oil Depot Attack, Assures Safety </p>
<p> Formula 1 and FIA issued a joint statement on Saturday declaring that the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is "secure" and would take place as planned. </p>
<p> Formula 1 and FIA issued a joint statement on Saturday declaring that the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is "secure" and would take place as planned. The development comes after the Yemeni Houthi rebels attacked an oil facility belonging to the Saudi government during the practice session on Friday. According to reports, after the missile strike, drivers and other stakeholders voiced their concerns, prompting the FIA to issue a statement assuring the event's safety. </p>
<p> "Formula 1 and FIA can confirm that following discussion with all the teams and drivers, the 2022 FIA Formula 1 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will continue as scheduled," the statement read. </p>
<p> Following the widely reported incident that took place in Jeddah on Friday, there has been extensive discussion between all stakeholders, the Saudi government authorities, and security agencies who have given full and detailed assurances that the event is secure," the statement added. </p>
<p> "It has been agreed with all stakeholders to maintain a clear and open diagolue throughout the event and for the future," FIA and Formula 1 said while concluding the statement. </p>
<p> Jeddah missile attack </p>
<p> The missile attack, which took place on Friday, occurred just a few kilometres away from the Jeddah Corniche Circuit, where the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix was scheduled to be held. FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem and Formula 1 CEO Stefano Domenicali met with drivers and team principals of all 20 squads before the qualifying session on Saturday and assured them of safety for this weekend's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. The main event is slated to place on Sunday at 10:30 p.m. local time. </p>
<p> "We are aware of the attack on the Aramco distribution station in Jeddah earlier this afternoon and remain in direct contact with the Saudi authorities," race promoter Saudi Motorsport Company said in a statement. </p>
<p> "The race weekend schedule will continue as planned. The safety and security of all our guests continue to be our main priority and we look forward to welcoming fans for a weekend of premium racing and entertainment." the statement added. </p>
<p> As far as the second practice session is concerned, Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc beat Red Bull's Max Verstappen to finish on top of the chart. Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton finished fifth followed by his teammate George Russell. Leclerc had also finished first in the first practice session. </p>

<p> Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez stops Billy Joe Saunders to unify the WBC, WBA and WBO super-middleweight titles in Texas </p>
<p> Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez halts Billy Joe Saunders after the eighth round to unify the WBC, WBA and WBO super-middleweight titles at the AT&T Stadium, Arlington </p>
<p> By Richard Damerell </p>
<p> Sunday 9 May 2021 14:24, UK </p>
<p> Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez spitefully stopped Billy Joe Saunders to unify the WBC, WBA and WBO super-middleweight titles in Texas. </p>
<p> The Mexican star unloaded a huge uppercut to inflict a nasty swelling around the right eye of Saunders, who did not come out for the ninth round at the AT&T Stadium, Arlington. </p>
<p> After a fiery build-up, Saunders had frustrated Canelo with his slippery southpaw skills, but his spirited resistance was suddenly broken by a four-weight champion who cemented his status as the sport's No 1 fighter. </p>
<p> Stabbing out a swift jab, Saunders searched for his range in the opening round, but Canelo gave a glimpse of his brute force with a thudding body shot. </p>
<p> A straight right forced Saunders onto his heels in the second round as Canelo cranked up his power, prompting roars of delight from his vociferous support. </p>
<p> Saunders shook his head defiantly after withstanding a clubbing right hand in the third, then responded with clusters of precise punches in the fourth. </p>
<p> A left hook ripped through Canelo's guard as Saunders swaggered through the fifth, even sticking his tongue out after landing more sharp counters in the sixth. </p>
<p> Also See: </p>
<p> Irritation was creeping into Canelo, who was circled by the evasive Saunders in the seventh. </p>
<p> But a huge uppercut staggered the Brit in the eighth and Canelo orchestrated the crowd with his fists before punishing the swollen eye of Saunders. </p>
<p> After that brief, brutal assault, Saunders was unable to continue and his trainer Mark Tibbs waved it off to signal another world title triumph for Canelo. </p>

<p> Well, it was another one of those famous Champions League nights in Madrid yesterday. The iconic Real Madrid came from behind to beat PSG in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League. The epic comeback captured the imaginations of several teams and athletes around the world. One such athlete that could not hide his emotion after Real Madrid won was Ferrari driver Carlos Sainz. </p>

<p> All seemed lost for the Madrid team when Kylian Mbappé scored his first goal of the match and his second off the tie early in the game. But through sheer grit, Benzema led his teammates to an epic comeback that will long live in the memories of its supporters. </p>
<p> Sainz, who was on the edge of the seat throughout the match, could not hide his excitement at Karim’s match-winning goal. </p>
<p> ” BENZEMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,” Sainz wrote on Twitter. </p>
<p> ” Real Madrid, Bernabeu, and Champions. Someone tell me a more father combination than this! How can I not love you….#halamadrid,” wrote Carlos on his Instagram Story. </p>

<p> The Ferrari driver has been a lifelong Real Madrid fan and compared his current F1 team to the iconic Spanish Club. “It’s one way of saying it… but McLaren is Barca, which is also a very good team to be on.” </p>
<p> “But they are the two best teams in history and when you go from one to the other, it means that you are doing something right in Formula One,” said Sainz. </p>
<p> It would be interesting to see if Carlos can manage to watch his favorite team in the quarter-final stage at the Santiago Bernabeu. But a tight 2022 F1 season might be a roadblock but hopefully, he will continue to showcase his support from afar. </p>

<p> Pierre Gasly Spends a Glamorous Night in Paris With Football Icons Pogba and Lewandowski </p>
<p> Published 03/02/2022, 4:54 PM CET </p>
<p> The world of football and Formula One has always had a strong connection. This time AlphaTauri driver, Pierre Gasly, joined football stars, Robert Lewandowski and Paul Pogba, as well as other high-profile stars, to attend the late Virgil Abloh’s ‘Off-White’ show. </p>
<p> The artistic director of Louis Vuitton men’s wear collection sadly passed away at the age of 41. The event was held in Paris and served as a reminder of Abloh’s contribution to the world of fashion. </p>
<p> Who were the stars joining Gasly? </p>
<p> The 23- time Grand Slam winner, Serena Williams, was at the center of the show. She paid homage to Virgil. </p>
<p> The show also included the likes of Kendall Jenner, Rihanna, Idris Elba, Cindy Crawford, among others. Manchester United star Paul Pogba was seen with popular singer Pharrell Williams. He took to social media to commend the Paris Fashion Week and Virgil Abloh’s work. </p>

<p> Singers Ricky Martin, Maluma, and American rapper Kanye West also attended the event as the world came together to pay tribute to Virgil Abloh. </p>
<p> Gasly is optimistic ahead of the new season </p>
<p> Pierre Gasly feels positive and thrilled with the AT 03 ahead of the season opener at Bahrain. </p>
<p> Speaking to Formula One, he said, “I felt quite confident inside the car and it kind of responded the way I wanted.” He also admitted that there are some areas the team could still improve on. </p>
<p> The former Red Bull driver finished 9th in the drivers’ standings last campaign. He will look to further improve his performance as he continues to push for a spot in a championship-winning car. However, he remains completely focused on this season and will look to carry his strong momentum from last year. </p>

<p> AlphaTauri completed 308 laps over the three-day testing at Barcelona. Gasly finished 8th in the timesheet ahead of Carlos Sainz and Daniel Ricciardo. Even though the Frenchman crashed on the last day of testing, the team believe they have assembled enough data. </p>
<p> He added, “Unfortunately, I locked up my tyres during the morning running and damaged the car, but testing is about finding the limits and we’ve still been able to gather a lot of valuable data over the three days.” </p>

<p> South Africans and Pacific players to keep non-foreign category until 2024 | Rugby Football Union </p>
<p> March 30, 2022 c_admin Rugby Comments Off on South Africans and Pacific players to keep non-foreign category until 2024 | Rugby Football Union </p>
<p> The Rugby Football Union has ruled that Premiership stars from South Africa and the Pacific Islands will continue to be classified as non-foreign until 2024, when the governing body is seeking to introduce beefed-up rules on England-qualified quotas, the Guardian understands. </p>
<p> Premiership clubs are entitled to two foreign players in their matchday squads and before Brexit anyone from South Africa, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga was not considered a foreign player due to the 2003 EU Association Agreement. Clubs, however, had feared that would no longer be the case when the UK left the EU. </p>
<p> In the wake of Brexit the RFU opted temporarily to keep the existing definitions of non-foreign players and it is understood that at the union’s most recent council meeting an extension was agreed until the end of the 2023-24 season, after which the new Professional Game Agreement comes into force. </p>
<p> RFU guidance recently issued to clubs reads: “The decision on who can work in the UK is a matter for government. Player registration and classification rules however sit with the RFU and within the bounds of English law, it is the RFU’s decision to determine who is classified as a foreign or non-foreign player. As such due to the United Kingdom no longer being a member of the European Union, the RFU is working with stakeholders to determine the position going forwards with regards to the regulatory classification of foreign players. </p>
<p> “From summer 2024 there will be a new EQPs system and new foreign player rules. There is further work to do to agree the detail of this subject to a new Professional Game Agreement and introduction into regulation. Pending this, an interim position will exist such that players who are or would have been classified as a non-foreign prior to 1 January 2021 will retain such non-foreign classification until the end of the 2023-24 season. This extended transitional period allows time for agents, clubs and players to plan ahead.” </p>
<p> The RFU has previously stated that from August 2024 onwards the intention is to make it compulsory for clubs to have 15 English-qualified players (EQPs) in a matchday squad and to overhaul the foreign player rule. A statement from last year read: “The intention is to move to a position where there is a mandatory EQPs system under which Premiership clubs must have a minimum of 15 EQPs in each matchday squad and the end of the foreign player rule to provide better England player development opportunities while giving greater flexibility for Premiership clubs to select non-EQP players of any nationality.” </p>
<p> The RFU’s stated aim of making 15 EPQs per matchday squad mandatory is an attempt to bring England closer in line with France, who have reaped the rewards of their JIFF ruling. Last week the RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney, admitted “the English structure – everyone is fed up with it” and while he was referring more to the tug of war between club and country over England players both parties are seeking change from 2024 onwards. </p>
<p> The Springboks director of rugby, Rassie Erasmus, recently sounded a warning over the impact that the number of South Africa players in the Premiership was potentially having on England. </p>
<p> Writing for the Mail on Sunday, he said: “People say the English system is the envy of the world because it has all the resources. I disagree. People say South Africa are stupid for allowing our players to leave. Is it stupid? Look at England, there are six or seven South African players taking the places of young English players at Premiership clubs. For us, it’s wonderful. Is it good for England that Faf de Klerk is starting ahead of Raffi Quirke at Sale? No. Is it good for South Africa? Yes, it works for us.” </p>

<p> LOS ANGELES -- Three months after he seriously considered undergoing surgery to repair the torn ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow, Paul George soared for an alley-oop pass that was sailing out of bounds, extended his right arm as far as it could go to catch the ball and then hit Isaiah Hartenstein with a pass for a layup -- all in one motion. George's elbow is feeling good again -- and it showed. He had 34 points, six assists and four steals in his return to the court to lift the Clippers to a stirring, come-from-behind 121-115 win over the Utah Jazz at Crypto.com Arena on Tuesday night. George hit 5 of 7 shots, including 3 of 4 3-pointers, in the third quarter, when he erupted for 20 of his points to help the Clippers erase a 25-point deficit with 8:07 remaining in the frame. He made 6 of 9 3-pointers for the game. It was exactly what the Clippers had been missing since George last played on Dec. 22. "It's in the 90 percentile,"... </p>

<p> After missing three months with an elbow injury, LA Clippers All-Star guard Paul George returned to help his team rally from a 25-point deficit to beat the visiting Utah Jazz 121-115 on Tuesday night. He started and scored 34 points on 10-of-20 shooting (6-of-9 from 3), adding 6 assists, 2 rebounds and 4 steals in 31 minutes. Coach Ty Lue said before the game that George would be on a minutes restriction. George's 34 points were the most ever by a player who had missed their team's previous 40-plus games within one season, according to Elias Sports Bureau research. George now has more 30-point games this season (7) than the rest of the Clippers team combined (6).

<p> DALLAS -- For the first time since the first week of the regular season, the Los Angeles Lakers find themselves on the outside of the play-in tournament looking in after Tuesday night's 128-110 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. Playing without LeBron James (left ankle sprain) and Anthony Davis (right midfoot sprain), the Lakers trailed by as many as 37 points as Luka Doncic recorded a 30-point triple-double through the first three quarters (34 points, 12 rebounds, 12 assists). "We just didn't execute well enough and play with enough toughness, IQ, intelligence, focus and fight," Lakers coach Frank Vogel said. "So, not acceptable and just a poor performance across the board. Coaches, players, everybody." Los Angeles is No. 11 in the Western Conference with seven games remaining. The Lakers, at 31-44, have the same record as the No. 10 Spurs, but San Antonio owns the tiebreaker. Looking ahead to the final stretch, the Lakers have... </p>

<p> CHICAGO -- Villanova-bound Cam Whitmore scored 19 points, future Duke Blue Devil Dariq Whitehead added 13 points, and the East beat the West 105-81 at Wintrust Arena on Tuesday night. Whitmore had eight rebounds. Whitehead added seven rebounds and seven assists while taking MVP honors as the East rolled to an easy win. Duke-bound Mark Mitchell led the West with 19 points. Former NBA star Jermaine O'Neal sat courtside wearing a Louis Vuitton jacket and Chicago rapper G Herbo sat four chairs to his left. Lil Baby performed at halftime. The East had already put on quite a show by then, racing out to a 58-38 lead. Whitehead nailed three 3s and had 11 points to go with five assists in the half. Whitmore scored nine points, and the 6-foot-7 guard from Archbishop Spalding near Baltimore punctuated it with a windmill dunk in the closing seconds that drew the loudest roar from the crowd until Lil Baby took the floor.

<p> The acrimonious departure of Old Dominion, Marshall and Southern Miss from Conference USA to the Sun Belt Conference has been finalized, the latter league announced on Tuesday in a joint statement with the three schools. The schools are officially headed to the Sun Belt for the 2022 football season, ending a spate of legal wrangling that included court injunctions to delay arbitration. The terms of the separation agreement were not released. By departing at the end of this academic year, Old Dominion, Marshall and Southern Miss broke the Conference USA bylaws that require a 14-month notice before leaving the league. That caused the legal issues, which came into focus after the Sun Belt had already placed the three schools on the league's football schedule for 2022 when it was released on March 1. This means that Conference USA will play with 11 members next season. A schedule to reflect the league's new structure is expected to be released soon. Sources told ESPN that the odd... </p>

<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson might not be facing criminal charges, but NFL commissioner Roger Goodell made it clear Tuesday that Watson still could be disciplined under the league's personal conduct policy as a result of the 22 pending civil suits accusing him of inappropriate sexual conduct. Speaking at the conclusion of the league meetings here, Goodell said Watson was still under investigation by the NFL for potential violations of its personal conduct policy. League investigator Lisa Friel is overseeing the investigation, which Goodell said has no timetable for conclusion at this time. Once the investigation is concluded, it will be referred to a jointly appointed NFL/NFLPA disciplinary officer who will determine whether Watson should be suspended and/or fined for any violations of the personal conduct policy the investigation finds. "Obviously these are serious charges, so we're looking at it seriously," Goodell said. "The... </p>
<p> DALLAS -- The Los Angeles Lakers were without LeBron James and Anthony Davis for Tuesday's game against the Mavericks. James has been dealing with a left ankle sprain since Sunday and Davis hasn't played since Feb. 16, when he suffered a right midfoot sprain. Entering play Tuesday, L.A. was clinging to a half-game lead over the No. 11 San Antonio Spurs for the final spot in the Western Conference play-in tournament. "We identified right before that Pelicans game [Sunday] that these are our playoff games," Lakers coach Frank Vogel said before the game. "The playoffs start for other teams when the actual regular season ends, but every game matters for us right now so there's a playoff-series element to these final games. "And you start talking about what the mindset is. The intensity is a notch higher. The focus has to be a notch higher. Every possession matters. No techs. No delay of games. You have to get every loose ball. You have to... </p>

<p> Five-time Masters champion Tiger Woods, who is trying to come back from serious leg and foot injuries he suffered in a car wreck about 14 months ago, played 18 holes at Augusta National Golf Club on Tuesday, sources told ESPN. Woods, 46, played all 18 holes with his son, Charlie, and PGA Tour pro Justin Thomas, his close friend, sources said. "He played every one of them," a source told ESPN. "He looked good to me." Woods and his team arrived Tuesday morning at Augusta Regional Airport on his Gulfstream private jet, stirring anticipation on social media that he was preparing to play in the Masters. Augusta National, because of its many hills and length, is considered one of the most difficult walks in competitive golf.

On March 18, Watson received a five-year, $230 million fully guaranteed contract from the Cleveland Browns after getting traded by the Houston Texans. That's $80 million more than the previous NFL record for fully guaranteed money at signing. Now, the Ravens are looking to negotiate a contract extension with Jackson, who is entering his fifth-year option. "I'm trying to answer that when I had a reaction to it. And it's like, 'Damn, I wish they hadn't guaranteed the whole contract,'" Bisciotti said Tuesday at the NFL league meetings. "I don't know that he should've been the first guy to get a fully guaranteed contract. To me, that's something that is groundbreaking, and it'll make negotiations harder with... </p>

<p> Iowa sophomore Keegan Murray will enter the 2022 NBA draft. "I am forever grateful that Coach [Fran] McCaffery gave me the opportunity to live out my dream," Murray told ESPN on Tuesday. "Iowa will always be my home and I'm forever grateful to be part of Hawkeye Nation." Murray, the No. 5 prospect in the ESPN 100, was named a consensus first-team All-American after averaging 23.5 points, 8.7 rebounds and 1.9 blocks in 32 minutes per game. He led Iowa to a Big Ten tournament championship, being named Most Outstanding Player after scoring a record 103 points in four games. He is currently a finalist for some of the most prestigious postseason awards in college basketball, including the Wooden, Naismith and Lute Olson awards, all of which are presented annually to the top player in Division I men's basketball. Murray took a unique trajectory to emerging as a potential top-five pick this June. He graduated from Prairie High School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, with only one... </p>
<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The Baltimore Ravens signed coach John Harbaugh to a three-year contract extension, owner Steve Bisciotti announced Tuesday at the NFL league meetings. The extension puts Harbaugh under contract with the Ravens through the 2025 season and continues one of the longest runs of any active coach. It also represents a strong vote of confidence after the team's 8-9 season, which was the first time Harbaugh has finished in last place. Harbaugh, 59, was entering the final year of a four-year deal that he signed in January 2019. A source told ESPN last month that the sides were nearing a new contract. "No interest in having him go lame duck on me here. It's not fair to him," Bisciotti said. "I think John's grown and grown and grown. It's kind of interesting. I don't feel like I'm just signing up the same guy. I think that's really a compliment to him. I really feel like there's a rebirth in John as the years go on. Things that mattered to him don't matter as... </p>
<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The New England Patriots and free-agent safety Jabrill Peppers have reached agreement on a one-year deal that is worth up to $5 million, sources told ESPN on Tuesday. Peppers, 26, spent the past three seasons with the New York Giants -- the final two as a captain under former coach Joe Judge, who has returned to the Patriots as an offensive assistant coach. Last year, Judge had expressed a desire for Peppers to return to the Giants in 2022, and now the two connect again in New England. The 5-foot-11, 215-pound Peppers joins a safety group headlined by longtime captain Devin McCourty, veteran Adrian Phillips and third-year player Kyle Dugger. He visited with the Patriots on Monday. Peppers' 2021 season ended prematurely when he ruptured the ACL in his right knee during a Week 6 win over the Carolina Panthers. He is expected to be ready for the start of training camp, sources told ESPN. The New Jersey... </p>
<p> The New Orleans Saints' quarterback room will have a new look in 2022. The Saints agreed to terms with veteran Andy Dalton to presumably serve as Jameis Winston's backup, it was announced. Meanwhile, coach Dennis Allen confirmed Tuesday that New Orleans plans to use Taysom Hill primarily as a tight end. Dalton's one-year deal is worth up to $6 million, with $3 million guaranteed, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Winston signed a two-year deal worth $28 million plus incentives last week. The Saints were in the market for another veteran quarterback after allowing former backup Trevor Siemian to leave for the Chicago Bears in free agency. Dalton, 34, certainly qualifies as an upgrade after starting 148 career games with a 77-69-2 record with the Cincinnati Bengals, Dallas Cowboys and Bears over his 11-year career. It's no surprise the Saints want to continue using the versatile Hill, who has played as a quarterback... </p>
<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- NFL owners approved a modified proposal for overtime Tuesday that will guarantee each team a possession, but only in the postseason. The rule for regular-season games, which allows the team with the first possession to win if it scores a touchdown, will remain unchanged. A majority of NFL decision-makers arrived at The Breakers hotel this week willing to adjust overtime in some fashion, largely in reaction to public outcry after the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Buffalo Bills in overtime during the divisional playoff round with an opening-possession touchdown. The Indianapolis Colts and Philadelphia Eagles proposed a mandatory possession for both teams in all games, regular season and in the playoffs, but competition committee chairman Rich McKay said there was not enough support among owners to pass the rule unless it was amended to postseason only. Ultimately it passed by a vote of 29-3. If the score remains tied in the... </p>
<p> NFL owners on Tuesday approved a rule proposal to modify overtime in the playoffs by allowing both teams to have a possession, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Overtime in the regular season will remain with the current rules where a game can end with one team never touching the ball if the team that wins the coin toss scores a touchdown on their opening possession. The overtime rule came under scrutiny because of the advantage it gives teams that win the overtime coin toss, especially in the playoffs. The issue returned to the public sphere when the Kansas City Chiefs eliminated the Buffalo Bills from the divisional playoff round last season by scoring a touchdown on the opening possession of overtime. Since the current requirement for an opening-possession touchdown was instituted for the 2012 regular season, teams winning the coin toss have won 50% of the time, according to league data. That number has ticked up a bit to 54% since the league shorted overtime... </p>
<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Washington Commanders coach Ron Rivera called the organization an "easy target" to attack but said there's only one way to alter their reputation. "Quite honestly I'm tired of it, I really am," Rivera said. "But the only way to fix it is winning, and that's the truth." Since Washington hired Rivera after the 2019 season, he has had to contend with numerous non-football-related issues, from a name change to sexual harassment allegations by former employees that predated his regime. The NFL investigated the team's workplace culture for nearly a year, and Washington was fined $10 million after an oral report was given to commissioner Roger Goodell. The House Oversight and Reform Committee then became involved in October amid calls for the NFL to release the findings of the investigation. There was a February roundtable session in which former employee Tiffani Johnston accused owner Dan Snyder of sexual harassment. The NFL announced it... </p>
<p> The New Orleans Saints plan to use Taysom Hill primarily as a tight end instead of a quarterback going forward, new coach Dennis Allen confirmed Tuesday. That shouldn't come as a big surprise, considering the Saints -- after pursuing a trade for Deshaun Watson -- just signed Jameis Winston to a two-year deal with a base value of $28 million to be their starting quarterback. Still, it's noteworthy since Hill spent last summer in an open competition with Winston for the starting quarterback job, which won't be the case again in 2022. "I think the role for Taysom really is going to be a lot more of the kind of F tight end, 'move' tight end type of role. I think that's the direction that we need to move with him, because I think he can be one of the better players in the league in that role," Allen told reporters during the NFL annual meetings in Palm Beach, Florida. "So if Jameis is out there playing quarterback, I don't really like having Taysom next... </p>
<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- With the NFL season still roughly six months away, San Francisco 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan isn't ready to announce his starting quarterback. In fact, much like last season, he might never make a formal announcement. But, if it wasn't already clear that Shanahan and the Niners intend to turn the keys over to Trey Lance, Shanahan left plenty of subtle and not-so-subtle clues during his Tuesday morning media session at the NFL owners meetings at the Breakers Hotel. So far this offseason, the 49ers have been unable to trade incumbent quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, though not for a lack of effort. Shanahan reiterated what general manager John Lynch said Monday about Garoppolo's right shoulder surgery derailing potential trades. That doesn't change the idea that the natural next step is for Lance to take over as he enters his second NFL season. All signs still point to the Niners hanging on to Garoppolo until he's healthy and then hoping that... </p>
<p> The Green Bay Packers have a glaring weakness at wide receiver after trading Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders and losing Marquez Valdes-Scantling to the Kansas City Chiefs in free agency. Coach Matt LaFleur isn't trying to hide it, and he knows they have to do something significant to address issues at the position. "Certainly, if you look at our roster right now, we definitely need to get some speed in that room," LaFleur said Tuesday at the NFL owners meetings in Palm Beach, Florida. "We need a legit guy that can take off the top of the coverage. We lost a guy that was pretty good at doing that." LaFleur called Adams their "separator" because of the precise way the All-Pro ran routes and created space, even against double-teams. He dubbed Valdes-Scantling as "our speed guy," given his penchant for catching deep balls. At this point, the top of the Packers' depth chart at receiver includes Allen Lazard, Randall Cobb... </p>

<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft expressed frustration with his team's recent slide, but he has hope for the future led by coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Mac Jones. "I'm a Patriot fan, big time, first. More than anything, it bothers me that we haven't been able to win a playoff game in the last three years," Kraft said Tuesday from the NFL annual meeting. "After my family, there's nothing more important to me than the New England Patriots and winning football games. That's my passion, so whatever I can do -- hopefully in a small way to make that happen -- I'm there. I'm not happy that we haven't won a playoff game in three years. I think about that a lot." The Patriots' last postseason win was their 13-3 victory over the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII. The next season, in 2019, they won the AFC East but lost to the Tennessee Titans in the wild-card round at home in quarterback Tom Brady's final game... </p>
<p> CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The Carolina Panthers haven't ruled out re-signing quarterback Cam Newton, but the 2015 NFL MVP is exploring other options. "I have teams that are interested in signing me,'' Newton told ESPN's Adam Schefter in a text. "I am waiting on the best fit as it pertains to winning a championship and getting a fair chance to play.'' Newton led the Panthers to an NFL-best 15-1 regular-season record and a Super Bowl appearance in 2015. He has gone 30-36 as the starter since, 13-23 the past four seasons after shoulder and foot injuries diminished his effectiveness. He went 7-8 as the starter in New England in 2020 after Carolina released the three-time Pro Bowl selection before Matt Rhule's first season as head coach. The Panthers re-signed Newton late last season after starter Sam Darnold went on injured reserve. He went 0-5 as the starter and was replaced by Darnold in the final game. Rhule has been in contact with Newton since the end... </p>

<p> BRIDGEPORT, Conn. -- The UConn's women's basketball team extended its streak of consecutive Final Four appearances to 14 Monday night, as the No. 2 seed Huskies defeated No. 1 seed NC State 91-87 in a double-overtime instant classic in the Bridgeport Regional final. It was the first double-overtime game in the Elite Eight or later in the history of the NCAA women's basketball tournament, according to ESPN Stats & Information research. The game featured nine ties and 13 lead changes. "It's one of the best games I've ever been a part of since I've been at UConn," said coach Geno Auriemma, who has guided the Huskies to 22 Final Fours overall. "It was just amazing the way the 10 kids that are on the court are playing for their lives. Nobody wants to lose, and everybody is making big play after big play, and nobody backed down from the moment. It's a shame one of us had to lose, right? It would be great if both of us could go." The Huskies will face No. 1... </p>
<p> WICHITA -- With 5 minutes, 40 seconds left, Michigan's women's basketball team was within two points of Louisville with a trip to the Final Four on the line. But that's when the Cardinals' defense slammed the door shut on the Wolverines' hopes. One ACC No. 1 seed suffered Elite Eight heartbreak Monday, but the other is headed to the Final Four. Louisville, the top seed in the Wichita Regional, held off a gritty third-seeded Michigan team that was making its first appearance in the Elite Eight. With the 62-50 victory, the Cardinals head to their fourth Final Four; they lost in the championship game in 2009 and 2013 to UConn, and in the semifinals in 2018 to Mississippi State. Louisville will face No. 1 overall seed South Carolina in Friday's first semifinal (7 p.m. ET, ESPN) at Target Center in Minneapolis.

<p> OTTAWA, Ontario -- Ottawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk has died from an illness, the team said Monday night. He was 62. The team announced Melnyk's death with a statement from his family that mentioned "an illness he faced with determination and courage.'' The statement did not explain what the illness was, and a team spokesman did not immediately respond to a message seeking additional details. Melnyk had a liver transplant in 2015 after a public campaign for a donor. He had owned the Senators since 2003, when he bought the NHL club for $92 million. The team made its only Stanley Cup Final appearance while under Melnyk's ownership, in 2007. "The National Hockey League mourns the passing of Ottawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk," NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement. "The words 'passion' and 'commitment' define the man who has owned the Ottawa Senators since 2003. Whether it was in the boardroom with his fellow governors, at the rink with his beloved Senators... </p>

It was the first double-overtime game in the Elite Eight or later in the history of the NCAA women's basketball tournament, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.

<p> The Muss Bus is getting crowded. Top-20 senior Anthony Black announced his commitment to Arkansas on Monday night, giving Eric Musselman and the Razorbacks their third five-star prospect in the 2022 class. Black chose Arkansas over perceived favorite Gonzaga, as well as a final list that also included Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, TCU and the G League. "I believe in Coach Muss and he knows what it takes to make it to the NBA. He coached there and has coached players to get there," Black told ESPN. "He is super intense and he will push me to be my best, stay on me and make me better. He has coached big guards in the past." A versatile 6-foot-7 perimeter player, Black is ranked No. 20 overall in the ESPN 100 for the 2022 class. He is the No. 9 small forward in the class, but is capable of playing either guard spot and is comfortable at multiple positions. Black was one of the breakout players nationally last summer, going from unranked to on the radar of nearly every... </p>
<p> Jerry Jones asked a judge Monday to toss out a paternity case against him, saying the 25-year-old congressional aide who alleges she is his daughter is involved in one of "multiple monetary extortion attempts" against him and the Dallas Cowboys. Jones' response to the lawsuit filed by Alexandra Davis says she delivered a draft of it to Jones on an unspecified date and asked whether he would "make a deal" to "assure that he would not be publicly or privately identified" as her father. The court motion does not identify the people who have allegedly attempted to extort Jones and the Cowboys or for how much. "The potential source(s) of those attempted extortions ... will be the subject of other litigation which has been filed or will be instituted shortly," wrote Jones' lawyers, Levi McCathern II and Charles L. Babcock, in the motion filed before a court-mandated deadline on Monday afternoon. However, a March 10 demand letter from Babcock connects the Davis paternity lawsuit... </p>
<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- All 32 NFL teams will hire a minority offensive assistant coach for the 2022 season, part of a series of policy enhancements announced Monday to address the league's ongoing diversity efforts. The coach can be "a female or a member of an ethnic or racial minority," according to the policy adopted by NFL owners during their annual meeting, and will be paid from a league-wide fund. The coach must work closely with the head coach and the offensive staff, with the goal of increasing minority participation in the pool of offensive coaches that eventually produces the most sought-after candidates for head-coaching positions. "It's a recognition that at the moment, when you look at stepping stones for a head coach, they are the coordinator positions," said Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney II, the chairman of the NFL Diversity, Equity and Inclusion committee. "We clearly have a trend where coaches are coming from the offensive side of the ball in recent... </p>
<p> The Los Angeles Lakers have listed LeBron James and Anthony Davis as doubtful for Tuesday night's road game against the Dallas Mavericks. Davis went through a full live practice for the first time since suffering a right mid-foot sprain Feb. 16 against the Utah Jazz, coach Frank Vogel said Monday. "We're at a point now where it's really about how he responds to that and the level of soreness he has coming out of his first live work," Vogel said of Davis. James did not participate in practice, Vogel said. The Lakers star stayed back at the hotel to undergo treatment on the left ankle sprain he suffered in L.A.'s 116-108 loss to the New Orleans Pelicans on Sunday. James was dealing with swelling in the ankle on Monday, the coach said. Vogel said the timing of Davis readying for a return just as James is dealing with another injury that could keep him out of the lineup fits with the "snakebitten" nature of the Lakers' season. "It's... </p>
<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The New York Giants haven't made any calls to other teams about trading running back Saquon Barkley, even if they have received some. General manager Joe Schoen emphasized the distinction Monday at the NFL's annual meetings, the first time he's talked publicly since the scouting combine, when he declared the team open to a potential trade. The Giants at that time were trying to shed some $40 million in salary-cap space to get their financials in order for this season. "That was taken a little bit out of context at the combine. I haven't called one team on Saquon Barkley," Schoen said Monday about the idea the Giants were shopping the running back. "Everybody ran with that from the combine. I said I would listen if people called on any players. It would be irresponsible if I didn't. That doesn't mean I'm going to do every deal. So I haven't called one team on Saquon Barkley. "I've got calls about a few of our players. He's one where a couple... </p>
<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- As one of 10 members of the NFL's competition committee, Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin is carefully evaluating the two overtime rule modification proposals at the NFL owners meetings. The Indianapolis Colts and Philadelphia Eagles submitted a proposal that would allow both teams an opportunity to possess the ball, while the Tennessee Titans proposed that both teams have the opportunity to possess the ball unless the first team scores a touchdown and makes a two-point conversion. Tomlin, who has been on the committee since 2013, said Monday he's in favor of an overtime rule that most closely resembles the traditional overtime structure. "To be quite honest with you, I'm a sudden-death advocate," he said. "I'm a traditionalist. I don't fear sudden death and I never have, but obviously I lost that battle a decade ago. But my position remains unchanged. I am one of the few sudden-death advocates I would imagine. "I just... </p>
<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- With the expectation that a trade would be forthcoming and Trey Lance would be taking over as the team's starting quarterback, Jimmy Garoppolo sounded certain at his Feb. 1 news conference that it would be his last as a member of the San Francisco 49ers. Nearly two months later, Garoppolo is still with the 49ers, and that doesn't appear to be changing any time soon. Speaking at the NFL owners meetings at The Breakers hotel, Niners general manager John Lynch made it clear he doesn't envision a scenario in which Garoppolo will be released. "I don't foresee that," Lynch said Monday. "He's too good a player. I think Jimmy will be playing for us or will be playing for someone else. He's too good of a player not to be." Which means the only path the Niners see for a divorce with Garoppolo this offseason will have to involve a trade market that has yet to materialize. On Monday, Lynch offered some insight into that, as well as potential... </p>
<p> DETROIT -- Motown will be the stage of the 2024 NFL draft. The NFL announced Monday at the annual league meeting in Palm Beach, Florida, that the draft will be held in downtown Detroit around Campus Martius Park and Hart Plaza. "The draft has become a prominent offseason event across the country, and we are excited to work with the Lions and their partners to bring the 2024 NFL draft to the Motor City," NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. "With the help of Visit Detroit, the Detroit Sports Commission, and the City of Detroit the Lions passionate fan base and all visitors will be treated to an incredible three-day experience." The draft experience will include three days of fan interaction. There will be an interactive football theme park where fans can enjoy games, exhibits, musical performances and autograph sessions plus have an opportunity to take pictures with the Vince Lombardi Trophy. This will mark the first time that Detroit has hosted the draft. "Today... </p>
<p> The city of Detroit will host the 2024 NFL draft, the league announced Monday at the annual league meeting in Palm Beach, Florida. The NFL said the area around Campus Martius Park and Hart Plaza will serve as the site for the draft. This year's draft will take place in Las Vegas while the 2023 event will be held in Kansas City. </p>
<p> Boston Celtics center Robert Williams III -- an anchor of the league's best defense -- suffered a meniscus tear in his left knee, the team announced Monday. He will miss several weeks at minimum, sources told ESPN. An MRI on Monday revealed the tear, and further evaluation during the day will help provide a timetable on a possible return. The Celtics said an update will be provided later in the week. Boston moved into first place in the Eastern Conference on Sunday, and Williams, 24, has been an immense part of a dominant league-best defense. He was injured in the 134-112 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves on Sunday -- the Celtics' 24th victory in 28 games. Williams is No. 1 among 169 players in the league who have defended 500-plus shots as the closest defender, per Second Spectrum tracking. Only Williams has held opponents under 40% shooting. Williams -- who signed a new four-year, $54 million extension in the offseason -- has averaged 10 points, 9.6... </p>

<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick said Monday that Matt Patricia, the former Detroit Lions head coach and New England defensive coordinator, will be part of the team's offensive coaching staff in 2022. It's a notable transition for Patricia, whose primary focus since entering the NFL in 2004 has been on defense. Patricia will work alongside former New York Giants head coach Joe Judge, the longtime Patriots special teams coach, as Belichick reshapes his offensive staff following the departure of coordinator Josh McDaniels to become Las Vegas Raiders head coach. Belichick hasn't named an official offensive coordinator -- he said Monday that he doesn't believe in titles -- but in his first public remarks since mid-January, he singled out Patricia and Judge as those whom he will be relying upon to help replace McDaniels. He deflected a question on which coach would call plays -- a key role given the presence of promising... </p>
<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Indianapolis Colts coach Frank Reich moved on from Carson Wentz, but he's not budging off what he thinks the quarterback can still become in the NFL now that he's in Washington. "I really believe he can be a top-10 quarterback," Reich said. "That's not just a given. That has to be earned and proven, so we're all hoping that happens for him." The Colts traded Wentz to the Washington Commanders earlier this month, one year after acquiring him from the Philadelphia Eagles. Washington swapped second-round picks with the Colts and sent them a third-round pick as well as a conditional third. Washington also received a seventh-round pick. Though Reich said the decision to trade him was unanimous, he remains sold on Wentz's potential. He was the offensive coordinator for Wentz's first two seasons in Philadelphia, including in 2017 when the quarterback was considered an MVP candidate before tearing his ACL. "I love the guy, I really do.... </p>
<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- The Detroit Lions will be the featured team in the 2022 training camp version of "Hard Knocks," according to an announcement made Monday by HBO and NFL Films to league owners at their annual meeting. Based on NFL rules for ensuring cooperation with the show, the Lions were one of three teams that could not turn down an invitation from the documentary series that follows NFL teams throughout training camp. The other two were the Carolina Panthers and New York Jets. A major part of the Lions' allure is coach Dan Campbell, whose colorful news conferences and unique aphorisms brought levity and interest to his 3-13-1 debut with the Lions last season. In a statement, Lions president and CEO Rod Wood said: "We are excited about the opportunity to showcase the City of Detroit and the amazing culture we are building at the Lions.

<p> PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Quarterback Baker Mayfield remained on the Cleveland Browns' roster Monday morning, 10 days after the team traded for Deshaun Watson. Nevertheless, the Browns have every plan to part ways with him, coach Kevin Stefanski said during a media availability at the league's annual meeting. "I think everyone understands the situation, and we're hoping that it is resolved soon," Stefanski said. Mayfield has been the starter since his rookie season in 2018, but the Browns have overhauled the position this month, trading for Watson and signing free agent Jacoby Brissett as his backup. Mayfield is guaranteed his full base salary of $18.858 million in 2022, a factor that is likely complicating trade efforts. "It's a unique situation," Stefanski said.

<p> SYDNEY: Australia paceman Mitchell Starc has indicated his dissatisfaction over Cricket Australia's determination arrangement platitude its challenging to convey consistency ''when you play one diversion and you're dropped''. The left-arm speedy has been lock stock and done with the Australian side in the course of recent months, and throughout the present Ashes arrangement in England the example has proceeded. </p>
<p> "No doubt, I figure it might be superb to get a couple of diversions once again to back and get that cadence," Starc said. </p>
<p> In the wake of beginning in the first Test he was let alone for the second at Lord's before returning for the third at Old Trafford, just to be sidelined once more at Durham. The medicine has obviously disturbed the 23-year-old quick bowler, who is the second-most astounding-paid player on Cricket Australia's books however has been unable to nail down a perpetual place in the Test line-up, Fairfax Media reported Monday. "Yes, I surmise it might be superb to get a couple of amusements over to back and get that cadence," Starc said. "At the same time to have a chance at that consistency that every living soul discusses --'you've became more dependable' --well, its a spot hard when you play one diversion and you're dropped." Conspicuous ex-players and the media have consistently criticised Australia's disagreeable utilization of the player turn strategy, especially for quick bowlers, intended to prepare for them breaking down from a lot of cricket. Test leg-turn incredible Shane Warne once said: "When we were number one there weren't mission proclamations flying around, however we got the determination transform right and the best 11 were chosen for each diversion." Starc, who has taken eight wickets in two matches at 27.12 in the Ashes arrangement, said he needed to show at preparing he was primed to come back to the group. ''So finally it returns to improving off the field and verifying I'm nailing everything and determining I'm thumping down that avenue to be in the group," he said. ''I'm pretty content with where my opposite swing playing is and the extent I am taking care of business the ball to swing yet I conjecture its accomplishing more harm with the new ball and being more steady when the ball isn't doing anything whatsoever... so I know where I have to show signs of improvement and its only a matter of doing it.'' Starc has a specific end goal, which is to return for the last Test at The Oval on Wednesday having played in Australia's practice match against the England Lions in Northampton while Ryan Harris and Peter Siddle were shown an a bit of mercy. 'I suppose the first two (Tests) I played consecutively (in 2011) and I played the final session of the South African arrangement and the first round of the Sri Lankan arrangement... other than that never over to back,'' he said. </p>

<p> Chester-le-Street: England will offer to finish the second 50% of their Ashes mission when they confront most despised adversaries Australia in the fourth Test at Chester-le-Street beginning from Friday. The drawn third Test at Old Trafford left England an unassailable 2-0 up in the arrangement with two to play and implied they`d held the Ashes. At the same time it left open the conceivability of an imparted arrangement, something that hasn`t happened in an Ashes fight since 1972. It took England only 14 days to clutch the urn this time around --the fastest they`ve settled an Ashes arrangement in their favour since the closure of the Second World War. Then again, England mentor Andy Flower was a long way from fulfilled. "I assume it is (an incredible accomplishment). Be that as it may for me it`s all about winning this arrangement, so it is still buzzing with two Tests to go," he said. In Manchester, Australia processed a highly enhanced execution with England breaking down to 27 for three on Monday`s last day before drizzle guaranteed a draw. The outcome implied Australia had finished a run of six successive Test routs --their most noticeably bad for 29 years --and abstained from equalling their record-breaking record losing streak of seven straight Tests set by the nineteenth century groups of 1885-88. Previous Australia skipper Allan Border said it resembled the travelers had "drawn their own particular line in the sand", similarly his side did throughout the 1986/87 arrangement, where, having lost the Ashes, they won the last Test in Sydney before beginning 16 years of unbroken arrangement predominance against England in 1989. "England are concerned," Border said. "The way this side is heading through the following not many months, gaze out. Australia has the force." Of course, Australia had all the more "energy" throughout the 2010/11 Ashes in the wake of winning the third Test by 267 runs in Perth to level at 1-1. Yet England won the fourth Test in Melbourne by the colossal edge of an innings and 157 races to hold the Ashes. Australia mentor Darren Lehmann put the Old Trafford attract setting by saying: "We`re not set to lose five nil, so that`s a begin. I suppose it (the force) has moved however just time will let that know won`t it?" At Old Trafford, Australia commander Michael Clarke`s 187 was the foundation of a telling first innings sum of 527 for seven proclaimed. In any case all through his side`s lean spell Clarke has been making hundreds --one of the tests for Australia will be to check whether any of their other master batsmen can take action accordingly. Both sides, with only a three-day turnaround between the closure of the third Test and the inaugural Ashes match to be arranged at the central station of north-east area Durham, have supported their pace rocking the bowling alley stocks. England have included Surrey quick bowler Chris Tremlett and Durham`s in-structure Graham Onions to their Old Trafford XI. "We are truly ready to be adaptable on that front," said Flower. "It`s not a change of arrangement." Australia named a 12 on Wednesday where Jackson Bird was added to their Manchester XI in the company of concerns over the capability of damage inclined seamer Ryan Harris to play again to-back Tests. Concerning England normally losing top request wickets with not many runs on the board this Ashes, Flower said: "There are exceptional new-ball bowlers on both sides. Obviously, we`d get a kick out of the chance to be none down in that early time of play. At the same time we`ve recouped well, and I suppose exceptional sides do that." In the interim the Decision Review System produced more contention this arrangement after Australia`s Channel Nine TV affirmed on Wednesday that England`s Kevin Pietersen was around players on both sides associated with utilizing silicone tape on their bats to maintain a strategic distance from scratches being caught by "Hot Spot" engineering. It was a story invalidated passionately by Pietersen himself, while Clarke denied any Australians were included in sharp practice. Also the International Cricket Council demanded its general director of cricket, Geoff Allardice, was flying out to Durham exclusively to identify with the groups in regards to their DRS concerns and wasn`t exploring any charged endeavors to "trick" Hot Spot. </p>

<p> Manchester: Officials were at the end of the day at the core of dispute in this Ashes arrangement when they took the players off the field for awful light on the fourth day of the third Test at Old Trafford. Australia, 2-0 down in the five-match arrangement and expecting to win this match to stand any possibility of recapturing the Ashes, were 172 for seven in their second innings --a lead of 331 runs --when umpires Marais Erasmus and Tony Hill called an end at 4.26pm on Sunday. Ensuing rain anticipated the match continuing and play was authoritatively deserted at 5.38pm, with authorities --greatly criticised for their usage of the Decision Review System this arrangement --going under examination once more. Australia skipper Michael Clarke, 30 not out, was plainly enraged at being reprimanded to strive for awful light in a scenario where any stoppage expanded England`s risks of securing the draw that might see them hold the Ashes. In spite of the fact that the floodlights were on, the umpires chose conditions were so unsafe it would have been impossible proceed when it looked as though quick medium bowler Stuart Broad was going to be carried into the strike. "We attempt and play provided that we can. We were equipped to stay out a heck of a considerable measure more drawn out under the lights --yet when we began losing it (following the ball) totally from square leg, we gave the captain (England chief Alastair Cook) the alternative to utilize turn, and he didn`t need to do that," said New Zealand`s Hill. It used to be the situation the umpires might `offer` the light to the batsmen to check whether they needed to proceed or not. Be that as it may a change to the regulations in October 2010 left the issue singularly in the hands of the umpires after concerns had been raised the old framework was unjustifiable to the fielding side. "The playing conditions updated a couple of years prior so it`s now our choice," said Erasmus, whose joint question with Hill on Sky TV was booed by irate fans when replayed over the goliath screens at Old Trafford. "For a spell there England`s fielders were getting some information about the light and the probability when they bat. "It was fine by then yet it continued dropping, dropping, dropping. "Finally we told the chief (Cook) to bowl turn which in the end he chose not to. That pushed our hand since it`s a wellbeing issue." Clarke had a drawn out discussion with South African official Erasmus as he and batting accomplice Ryan Harris stayed in the center while England strolled off. In the end, the Australians emulated their adversaries into the changing area. With sprinkle gauge for Monday, inquiries were asked for what reason Clarke hadn`t announced, particularly as the most any side have made to win in the fourth innings of an Old Trafford Test is England`s 294 for four against New Zealand in 2008. England entangled Australia`s triumph offer by dodging the accompany on prior Sunday in the wake of continuing on 294 for seven accompanying Kevin Pietersen`s noteworthy 113 on Saturday. They required 34 hurries to make Australia bat again and the eighth wicket twosome of Matt Prior (30) and Stuart Broad (32) knocked them off with a flurry of limits in an eighth-wicket stand of 58. The pair then joined together to evacuate Australia opener Chris Rogers for only 12 when quick medium bowler Broad took the outside edge and wicketkeeper Prior, plunging before first slip, held an exceptional get. Prestigious one-day batsman Warner, more than once booed by home fans in the wake of missing the first two Tests of this arrangement for his tavern strike on England`s Joe Root, was elevated to open nearby Rogers as Australia looked for fast runs. The left-hander made 41 off 57 balls before he was gotten in the profound by Root off seamer Tim Bresnan before Usman Khawaja (24) was knocked down some pins round his legs by off-spinner Graeme Swann. General opener Shane Watson then uppercut Bresnan straight to Pietersen at third man after a misunderstanding saw Steven Smith unnecessarily run out for a run-a-ball 19 after he`d driven both Bresnan and Swann for six. </p>

<p> London: It was yet an additional entrancing day of Test cricket after Ian Bell hammered his second successive ton and Steven Smith picked three late wickets to mark England's restoration on the very first moment of the second Ashes Test being played at Lord's. Alastair Cook won the throw and chose to bat first on a wicket that appeared ideal for batsmen. At the same time the move exploded backward after Watson struck promptly in the innings when Alastair Cook was gotten plumb before the wicket. Before long after the first wicket, Ryan Harris, who displaced Mitchell Starc for the second Test, released Joe Root (6) and Kevin Pietersen (2) in snappy progressions as England ended up wobbling at 28/3. Be that as it may Australia's sit tight for the fourth wicket was enlarged by Jonathan Trott and the in-structure Ian Bell as both of them sewed a 99-run organization for the fourth wicket before Ryan Harris picked his third wicket of the day, when Trott confounded a short ball straight to Khawaja at profound midwicket. England required an additional organization to achieve a fair aggregate on Day 1 which was furnished by Johnny Bairstow and Ian Bell as they included 144 runs for the fifth wicket. Bairstow was lucky on one event when he was knocked down some pins by Siddle on 21 off a no-ball. Ian Bell by and by played an out of this world thump under force and he quieted each one of the aforementioned who said he wouldn't have the capacity to play with the same trust in the second Test too. England appeared to be on top towards the closure of the day, before Michael Clarke brought Steven Smith into the assault. The right-arm leg-spinner rejected Bell (109) in the first over he played and after that went onto scalp the wickets of Bairstow (67) and Prior (6) that moved the energy Australia's way. England were 289/7 at the finish of the first day..... </p>

<p> Georgetown: Shahid Afridi made a standout amongst the most astounding comebacks in universal cricket in heading Pakistan to a squashing 126-run triumph over the West Indies in the first day global at the Guyana National Stadium on Sunday. Precluded from his country`s came up short Champions Trophy fight, the inconsistent all-rounder furnished a proportional payback ever ODI playing figures by a Pakistani, and the second best general, in trapping seven for 12 to defeat the home side for only 98 off 41 overs in the wake of having top-scored with a commonly swashbuckling 76 in the visitors` sum of 224 for nine. "I attempt earnestly and I back myself and I need to thank individuals back home," said Afridi. "It`s not time for me to simply get by in the group, yet to give a considerable measure to the group. I tried to stay positive. "Whenever I made history the ball in my zone I pulled out all the stops. What's more what a pitch it was for me to bowl on. I just kept it modest, and it met expectations." This match spoke to yet an additional dazing spike in the 17-year universal profession of Afridi whose capability to joy and stimulate with his excessive way has regularly been eclipsed by an essentially endless inadequacy to convey at the most incredulous of times. Luckily for Pakistan, this was not one of the aforementioned times and his effect on the match began with his command of a 120-run sixth-wicket association with his commander, Misbah-ul-Haq (52), the pair safeguarding their group from the profundities of 47 for five in the wake of gangling quick medium bowler Jason Holder had wrecked the top request in fulfilling with the great figures of four for 13. While Misbah laboured towards yet a different workmanlike half-century, involving 121 conveyances, Afridi`s thump was a sea tempest by correlation, adorned by five sixes and six fours off only 55 conveyances. He looked well on the best approach to finishing a hundred yet died in the 39th over, got by Darren Sammy at profound midwicket off the playing of Kieron Pollard. West Indies might have been needing any semblance of Pollard and individual huge hitter Chris Gayle to process comparable innings to give their group a battling risk of getting the 225 runs required for triumph. However that trust never materialised, keeping in mind Afridi took the greater part of the radiance with his annihilation work with the ball, the early harm was carried out by Mohammad Irfan. In cloudy, seamer-accommodating conditions, the titan left-arm pacer perturbed the top-request of the West Indies with his pace and trajectory from such an incredible tallness, playing Johnson Charles with a swinging full-throw then afterward constraining Darren Bravo to glove a lifting conveyance on the form for wicketkeeper Umar Akmal to bring the get down the leg-side. Pakistan then got a gigantic help when new batsman Marlon Samuels called Gayle for a sharp single and Misbah`s control hit from spread discovered the perilous opener short of his ground and the West Indies wobbling gravely at seven for three. All the backing bowlers kept up the force and when Afridi went ahead as the fifth change, the conduits truly opened. Unable to adapt to his mixed drink of top-spinners and googlies, a progression of batsmen badly furnished rationally and in fact to adapt to such wiles succumbed without much of a battle as five wickets crashed for 14 runs. Just Samuels (25) indicated any important safety, however it was never set to be sufficient against a widespread Afridi, who completed off the match by trapping Holder, the early destroyer for the West Indies, tangibly lbw. </p>

Only in the middle session, when the seamers twigged the length and line to bowl, did they apply the sort of consistent pressure that would have made batting even more of a trial than it was. Two wickets only fell before lunch – a paltry return not helped by Matt Prior grassing two chances from Stuart Broad in the first 15 minutes and another Moeen Ali with the final delivery of the session – but four in the afternoon meant that that by tea India had been reduced to 140 for six, and 145 for seven shortly after the interval.

<p> The 26-year-old Serbian tennis player Novak Djokovic is No. 1 in the ATP rankings for the 100th week in his career. </p>
<p> He is the ninth man to reach this milestone, joining with Andre Agassi (101 weeks), Rafael Nadal (102), Bjorn Borg (109), John McEnroe (170), Jimmy Connors (268), Ivan Lendl (270), Pete Sampras (286) and Roger Federer (302). </p>
<p> Novak Djokovic reached No. 1 in July 2011 and he lost the top spot to Roger Federer for three months in 2012 but regained it in November of that year. </p>
<p> “I was taught to dream big and to dream to be number one in the world,” he said. It takes years of hard work and dedication to become a champion, he added. </p>
<p> However, he is predicted not to top of the year-end rankings because Rafael Nadal has returned strong from his injury this year and has no points to defend for the remainder of 2013. </p>

<p> Strikers star linked with Big Bash rival </p>
<p> The veteran batsman is reportedly set for the exit, with one club front of the queue. </p>
<p> The Melbourne Renegades are reportedly expressing interest in Strikers batsman Jonathan Wells, who is tipped to depart Adelaide this off-season. </p>
<p> Wells is coming off a stellar Big Bash campaign that saw the Strikers finish one win from the season finale, with the 33-year-old having amassed the second-most runs for the season, tallying 586 runs at 41.86. </p>
<p> The middle-order hitter recorded three scores of 62 or more in the latter half of the BBL|11 season alone, however surprisingly missed a selection into the BBL Team of the Tournament. </p>
<p> Wells now looks set to depart the Strikers despite the stunning strike of form, with the Renegades understood to be at the front of the queue for the Tasmanian, according to CODE's Daniel Cherny. </p>
<p> The Renegades endured another disappointing Big Bash season to finish at the foot of the ladder, with their top order mix an area coming under criticism throughout the year. </p>
<p> Wells would suit several needs the Melbourne franchise have been craving, bringing an elite strike rate with the bat as well as bolstering their right-handed stocks. </p>
<p> The Strikers are reportedly open to leaving Wells out of their planning for the next BBL season, with the emergence of Matt Short, Matt Renshaw and international Ian Cockbain taking on more senior roles this season. </p>
<p> Finch is set to continue his tenure with the Renegades, while fellow veteran Shaun March signed a new two-year extension this week. </p>

<p> Here are the latest rugby headlines on Sunday, August 1. </p>
<p> Alun Wyn Jones warns that heads will roll </p>
<p> Alun Wyn Jones wasted no time in letting his Lions team-mates know heads could roll after the second Test defeat, with Warren Gatland likely to make a number of changes for the series decider. </p>
<p> It will be an anxious wait for the team announcement for more than a few, but the focus has always been on the squad as a whole over the matchday 23. </p>
<p> Dan Biggar revealed in his Mail on Sunday column: "Alun Wyn Jones spoke in the team huddle at the end and said that Warren Gatland has got some big calls to make this week about what he does with the team for the decider. </p>
<p> "He said he may well make changes and it's now about a squad effort to get this over the line. Next week is a cup final for us. We're lucky that we've got another shot to create history. </p>
<p> "If you're winning all the time, selection takes care of itself. If you get a disappointing performance like that then everyone's going to be on edge a little, naturally. </p>
<p> "It was pretty quiet dressing room after the game. You don't need to be a rocket scientist to see that we came off second best and didn't fire any shots." </p>
<p> England international's damning Hogg verdict amid calls for Welshmen to start </p>
<p> Mike Brown has delivered a scathing assessment of Stuart Hogg's performance and called for him to be dropped in favour of Liam Williams for the third Test. </p>
<p> The former England full-back also wants Welshman Josh Adams, the Lions top try-scorer on tour, to come into the side having been frozen out in the last two matches. </p>
<p> In his ratings for the Daily Mail, he awarded Hogg and Duhan van der Merwe a four out of 10. </p>
<p> Of Hogg, he said: "Aerially was awful under the high balls South Africa put up all night – looked uncertain from the start – which the Boks picked all their scraps off. </p>
<p> "Liam Williams must play the decider so the Lions can win the aerial battle." </p>
<p> He added of van der Merwe: "Silly yellow card for the trip on Kolbe in the first-half. The back-three was the Lions' weakest point, where Gatland must make changes. </p>
<p> "Only touched the ball once. I would bring in Josh Adams for him." </p>
<p> Sir Ian McGeechan was in agreement on those two changes, writing in The Telegraph : "Liam Williams, so good under the high ball, would surely have been used had he been on the bench and I expect him to start next week. </p>
<p> "So, too, should Josh Adams because the Lions desperately need players who can create and finish opportunities. I'd also start with Owen Farrell to bring fresh legs and fresh thinking." </p>
<p> 'Kolbe could have had two red cards' </p>
<p> Brian O'Driscoll has insisted Cheslin Kolbe could have had two red cards in the Lions' second Test defeat to South Africa. </p>
<p> The Ireland and Lions legend also revealed his concerns over the tourists' performance, saying they appeared to run out of ideas as the tide swung in the Springboks' favour. </p>
<p> "If you were to take those incidents based on what would go on in the Premiership, there could have been multiple red cards," O'Driscoll told Off The Ball. </p>
<p> "Cheslin Kolbe could have been sent off twice, he could potentially have gone off for his head collision with Tom Curry in the first half, which the referee didn't even look at at all. </p>
<p> "If you look at the Conor Murray fall, the ruling in the Premiership is that if you have to break your fall with an arm and that is what stops you landing on your head or neck, then that's a red card offence. </p>
<p> "That versus Ben O'Keeffe, who obviously referees in a different part of the world... there's this crazy scrutiny that has gone on this week, which is going to squeeze his decision-making and make him think twice about pulling out the red card. </p>
<p> "People will say about it being a Rassie Erasmus masterplan - maybe he got the break of the ball today but, ultimately, it doesn't make what he did any better or any more palatable. </p>
<p> "Yet, he won't care because they're 1-1 and it goes to a decider. All of the momentum is with South Africa at the moment. </p>
<p> "The Lions looked out on their feet and devoid of ideas, unfortunately. It didn't look like their creative players were able to create a lot." </p>
<p> South Africa coach hints Erasmus' rant allowed Springboks to focus on rugby </p>
<p> Jacques Nienaber has hinted Rassie Erasmus' social media rant allowed South Africa to focus on squaring the British and Irish Lions series out of the spotlight. </p>
<p> Rugby director Erasmus' 62-minute online rant against officiating from the Lions' 22-17 first Test victory dominated the build-up to Saturday's second encounter. </p>
<p> And head coach Nienaber suggested that allowed the Springboks to focus on shoring up their approach, ahead of a convincing second-Test victory over the tourists. </p>
<p> "Rassie as our director of rugby had something on his mind, something that we discussed," said Nienaber. "That's off-field stuff, and we knew we had to focus on the rugby. </p>
<p> "So hats off to the players. We had a review, a tough week because of that, we were hard on each other. It's not just players, it's coaches as well, sometimes we get things wrong. </p>
<p> "But we put our hands up and say 'Listen I made a mistake there'. We just focus on rugby and the things we can control. That's basically what we did. </p>
<p> "The other stuff is off-field stuff and that was handled by our director of rugby, and our stuff was on-field." </p>
<p> Ex-Springbok winger Bryan Habana was adamant it worked. </p>
<p> "Did Rassie's thing work by taking the pressure off the team to focus on how they want to play? When you beat the Lions by such a big margin in the second half, something definitely worked," he told Sky Sports. </p>
<p> "Without a doubt it worked. In the first 40 minutes you saw a lot of stop starts, questioning the referee, with every little detail going into that 'is it, isn't it'. </p>
<p> "It was a messy first 40, we all know that. As the Boks found their ascendancy in the second half, it became a lot easier for the officials to make the calls. </p>
<p> "That is something that Warren Gatland did with Marius Jonker two weeks ago, what Rassie did this week with putting the pressure on the referee in being intense and under the microscope. </p>
<p> "I'm not saying it's right, but it potentially worked out with that Am try." </p>
<p> Springbok likely to miss third Lions Test </p>
<p> Flanker Pieter-Steph Du Toit suffered a shoulder injury and is likely to miss the third Test. </p>
<p> "Obviously Pieter-Steph is a guy that won't come off normally in a game," said Nienaber. </p>
<p> "But the assessment on his shoulder hasn't been done by the medical team yet; it will take 48 hours for a proper diagnosis with all the special investigations to be done. But he's not normally a guy that comes off in a game." </p>

<p> 'Sunk And Sad': How Nadal's Injury May Hand Djokovic The Advantage At French Open 2022? </p>
<p> Rafael Nadal will be looking to win14th French Open title at Roland Garros this year however injury in run-up to the tournament will be hamper his preparation. </p>
<p> Rafael Nadal had been in red hot form during the start of the 2022 season winning the Australian Open and was on a 20-0 winning streak until the run was ended by American Taylor Fritz in two sets during the recent Indian Wells Open tournament. However, the loss has come at a price with the former World No 1 confirming his injury which will likely keep him out for at least 4-6 weeks and also put his French Open participation in jeopardy. Rafael Nadal injured his ribs during the semi-final match of the Indian Wells tournament. With French Open 2022 with little over a month away, Rafael Nadal's injury is a major boost for Novak Djokovic who is yet to play his first Grand Slam tournament of the season. </p>
<p> French Open 2022: Why Novak Djokovic is likely to benefit from Rafael Nadal injury </p>
<p> Rafael Nadal will be looking to win his 14th French Open title at Roland Garros this year however the injury in the run-up to the tournament will be hampering his preparation. Nadal’s participation at the Madrid Open at the end of April will likely depend on how his recovery progresses. The Spaniard is a five-time champion in Madrid. He is not likely to play in the Monte Carlo Masters and the Barcelona Open next month. The Spaniard had already decided to skip this week’s tournament in Florida and head home to Spain to prepare for the clay-court season. </p>
<p> Novak Djokovic is likely to have a huge advantage following Rafael Nadal's injury as he looks to defend his Roland Garros crown which he won last year. Djokovic missed out on the Australian Open since he is still unvaccinated, however with the french government likely to ease down the COVID rules, the Serbian still has a chance of retaining his crown. Compared to Rafel Nadal, Novak Djokovic will be going into the French Open 2022 tournament with a fresh start and also with an opportunity to bounce back on the Grand Slam stage after the Australian Open shame. </p>
<p> Rafael Nadal injury </p>
<p> Talking about Rafael Nadal's injury the underwent exams after arriving in Spain from the United States and results showed he has a stress fracture on one of his left ribs. The Spaniard took to Twitter to give an update on his injury. He wrote, " Hello everyone, I wanted to announce that I have returned to Spain and I immediately went to visit my medical team to do the tests after the Indian Wells final that I played with discomfort." </p>
<p> He further wrote," As it turns out, I have a stress crack in one of my ribs and will be out for 4-6 weeks. This is not good news and I did not expect this. I am sunk and sad because after the start of the season I have had such a good time. I reached a very important part of the year with very good feelings and good results. But hey, I've always had that fighting and overcoming spirit and what I will do is be patient and work hard after my recovery. Once again thank everyone for the support". </p>

<p> Suns, Cats suffer injury woes from Monday night clash </p>
<p> Both sides weathered personnel losses during the pre-season encounter. </p>
<p> Suns recruit Mabior Chol and Geelong utility Jed Bews are doubtful for Round 1 after both players were unable to complete a full four quarters of their side's pre-season hitout. </p>
<p> Gold Coast were able to get over the top of the Cats in convincing fashion at Metricon Stadium with Chris Scott's side missing a number of key players on the night. </p>
<p> However, the promising victory was soured for Suns coach Stuart Dew, with new arrival Mabior Chol forced to watch from the sidelines in the second half due to a hamstring injury. </p>
<p> With star forward Ben King out for the season with an ACL injury, Chol was moved into the forward line to shore up the side's attacking reinforcements and booted a goal in the second quarter before being benched for the remainder of the match. </p>
<p> Dew explained that the resting of the key tall was a precaution, however, the extent of his injury was still unknown. </p>
<p> "I guess when there's the word tight, you're in doubt until scans, and hopefully get hat ticked off," Dew said in his post-match interview. </p>
<p> "I think we're the last game in round one, so we've got a little bit of time. </p>
<p> "There's no need to test him now and our main session will be Friday week, so there's a bit of time there." </p>
<p> The pain was very much felt within both camps with Cats defender Jed Bews also suffering a suspected concussion in the first half, leaving him unable to partake in the side's Round 1 clash should he fail the concussion test. </p>
<p> Assistant coach Shaun Grigg said that the coaching staff were unsure about whether or not Bews would be good to go for the Cats' opening round clash against the Bombers. </p>
<p> "All we heard in the coach's box is he's in the concussion protocol," Grigg told media. </p>
<p> "Whatever that means medically, we'll get the info off the docs probably tomorrow." </p>
<p> Despite the injury to Chol, the Suns had plenty to smile about at Metricon Stadium with a number of players showing great promise in the final showing of pre-season. </p>
<p> Midfielder-turned-forward Jack Lukosius was imperious inside-50, booting three goals and taking six marks and looking at home in his new role. </p>
<p> Attacking counterpart Ben Ainsworth thrived across half-forward with five goals whilst in the middle of the park skipper Touk Miller (34 disposals, two goals), Matt Rowell (27 disposals, eight clearances) and Noah Anderson (25 disposals) all were industrious for the Suns. </p>
<p> As for the Cats, Cam Guthrie (32 touches, one goal), Jeremy Cameron (three goals) and Tom Atkins (25 disposals, six tackles) were best-on despite not getting the result they were hoping for in their last pre-season match of the year. </p>
<p> Gold Coast play the final match of Round 1, travelling to Optus Stadium to play the Eagles for the second consecutive season. </p>
<p> With the Eagles significantly weakened due to a mammoth amount of injuries, there has been no better time than the present for the Suns to spring an upset and get off to a good start in what is such a pivotal campaign for Stuart Dew. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, Geelong will go up against the rising Bombers in their season launch encounter at the MCG, with many punters expecting this to be the year that the old age of Chris Scott's side finally catches up with them. </p>

<p> Tennis News, 2021 Wimbledon Women Singles Semi-Final review </p>
<p> July 8, 2021 </p>
<p> by </p>
<p> Sports Benches </p>
<p> Great semi final matchup from Ash Barty at the Championships in Wimbledon, where she fired off well in the first set 5-3. </p>
<p> Although, Angelique Kerber began to chase her down when she led the majority of this next set 3-5. </p>
<p> But it’s Barty who eliminated Kerber with a brilliant comeback from behind, as she clinched the tiebreaker 7-6 (6-3). That is enough to advance into the final through straight sets. </p>
<p> Then we look at the other semi clash between Karolina Pilskova & Aryna Sabalenka. </p>
<p> Great start from the beginning in Sabalenka during a close first set battle, having gone ahead early at 5-7. </p>
<p> However, you cannot underestimate Pilskova where she dominated most of this 2nd semis game. </p>
<p> The competitiveness against one another is not easy along the way, but Pilskova managed to get the job done with the next two set wins, 6-4, 6-4. </p>
<p> Now we’re down between just Ash Barty & Karolina Pilskova in the women’s singles final this Saturday. It will be such a wild contest for sure & see who will lift this crown first. </p>

<p> Tennis News, Alexander Zverev rises in huge comeback from a 1st set loss that left Novak Djokovic out of the Gold Medal mix </p>

<p> Sports Benches </p>
<p> Novak Djokovic is on a roll when he was too good for Alexander Zverev with the first set win at 6-1 after the first 37 minutes of play, such an outstanding impact immediately from the Serbian. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, Zverev was on the same starting zone as Djokovic but struggled so far to fire the pressure back on his opponent as he needed a 2nd set turnaround to stay in this fight. </p>
<p> The German bounced back immediately after the break, even in the toughest of battles Zverev earned his reprieve against the World No.1 where he was mightily up front with the 2nd set win at 3-6. </p>
<p> 45 minutes in and we have a decider on our hands in a race to meet Karen Khachanov in the men’s singles gold medal match. </p>
<p> Zverev continued to win up to eight straight games in a row between the end of 2nd & midway through the final set at 0-4, while Djokovic is faltering where he continues to struggle with a lack of feel since the 2nd set. </p>
<p> And what a huge comeback from Germany’s Alexander Zverev who was too good in the end, having gone from a set down before he found a route that blew away Novak Djokovic with the win. </p>
<p> The final score is 6-1, 3-6, 1-6 & this game was completed in 2 hours and three minutes. </p>
<p> Bugger for the World No.1 who fired off well with an easy start, but began to lost some ground unfortunately & unable to find ways to get himself back in the game ever since. Novak still has a game to play for the bronze medal game though v Pablo Carreno Busta. </p>
<p> For now, it’s Alexander Zverev v Karen Khachanov for the gold medal in tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics. </p>

<p> Whose Ear Did Mike Tyson Bite Off In 1997? Throwback To The Infamous 'Bite Fight' </p>
<p> Whose ear did Mike Tyson bite off in 1997? It has been almost 23 years since the infamous 'Bite Fight', but boxing fans still reminisce about the incident. </p>
<p> Mike Tyson stunned the entire boxing universe for a bizarre reason when he bit off his opponent Evander Holyfield’s ear in one of the biggest heavyweight clashes of all time on June 28, 1997. Earlier billed as ‘’The Sound and The Fury”, the epic rematch ended controversially as the fight had to be called off after Mike Tyson chewed off a piece of Evander Holyfield’s ear and spit it on the canvas. </p>
<p> It has been almost 23 years since the incident, but boxing fans still reminisce like it was yesterday. Here’s everything you need to know about the fight and Evander Holyfield, who got his ear bitten by Mike Tyson. While Boxing Hall of Famer Evander Holyfield will need little introduction to fans that have been following the sport all their lives, new fans of the sport may still want to know whose ear did Mike Tyson bite off in 1997. </p>

<p> Paul Casey continued his remarkable recovery at The Players to get within two strokes of the halfway lead, as Rory McIlroy narrowly avoided missing the cut at TPC Sawgrass. </p>
<p> The world No 27 triple-bogeyed his opening hole of the tournament on Thursday before three late birdies salvaged a first-round 70, with Casey then posting an impressive bogey-free 69 on Sunday to stay in touch with 36-hole pacesetters Sam Burns and Tom Hoge. </p>
<p> Burns nailed a 75-foot eagle at the par-five 16th to close a three-under 69 and reach seven-under alongside overnight co-leader Hoge, who posted a second-round 71, while Harold Varner III and Erik van Rooyen both sit a shot off the halfway lead. </p>

<p> Casey followed birdies at the second and sixth by draining a 50-footer at the par-three 17th to join the group on five under that contains Tommy Fleetwood, who signed for a one-over 73, while the entire field is separated by just nine strokes heading into the final two rounds. </p>
<p> “I know I got the lucky side of the draw,” Casey said. “I’m very aware of that and it has been interesting watching the guys battle on the other side. I mean, I believe in the golfing gods and karma, so I don’t sit there gleefully watching it.” </p>

<p> “Luckily I was on the other side [of the draw],” Rahm said. “Today I was able to play a rather mediocre round of golf and post a decent score and I’m still in the hunt for this tournament, so I consider myself lucky.” </p>

<p> Top 25 Formula 1 drivers of all-time </p>
<p> Max Verstappen, Formula 1 (Photo by Rudy Carezzevoli/Getty Images) </p>
<p> Formula 1 has been around since 1950 and has seen all kinds of cars and tracks in its first 71 years. After more than 1,000 races, who are the sport’s top 25 drivers of all-time? </p>
<p> With another Formula 1 offseason nearing its end and the 2021 season scheduled to get underway later this month, let’s take a look at the sport from an all-time perspective. </p>
<p> Who are the top 25 drivers of all-time? </p>
<p> While it is impossible to compare drivers from so many different eras and there will naturally be many deserving drivers left off the list given the fact that Formula 1 competition dates back to 1950, here is a list of 25 drivers who we believe fit the bill as being among the greatest the sport has ever seen. </p>
<p> NOTE: Drivers from all eras considered and included. </p>
<p> Top Formula 1 drivers of all-time: #25 – Max Verstappen </p>
<p> Let me first be clear when I say that potential is not the only thing that factored into this ranking. Otherwise, how can you omit guys such as Charles Leclerc, George Russell and Lando Norris? </p>
<p> No; Max Verstappen is the real deal, and he has already proven it. Yes, there is an aspect of potential to this ranking, but what he has already done shows us that there is a heck of a lot more to consider than what he “might” do. </p>
<p> Verstappen is not a world champion, but as the youngest driver to reach 10 wins, he has all the makings of a future one, and he has already proven his ability to get the absolute most out of his machinery, even when it may not be the best on the grid. </p>
<p> Additionally, his prowess in the rain, highlighted by one particular performance in his rookie season and a dominant effort in 2019 that led to a victory, has been likened to that of another legend of the sport who you won’t find for another several slides. </p>
<p> It will be interesting to see what the 23-year-old can do in the near future, especially with Red Bull aiming to unseat Mercedes as the top team in the sport and with the new rules and regulations set to come into effect in 2022. </p>

<p> Welcome to MMA Junkie's European Union Experience. </p>
<p> Dana White suggests Paulo Costa fight out UFC contract, 'should have started a YouTube channel' at 13 </p>
<p> Recently, UFC middleweight contender Paulo Costa took to social media to voice his displeasure with his current pay situation compared to what YouTubers are earning in exhibition fights, but UFC president Dana White doesn’t want to hear it. </p>
<p> In a series of tweets on June 5, Costa (14-1 MMA, 5-1 UFC) suggested that the UFC should be paying him more than what he is currently earning, considering his placement as a main event fighter. </p>
<p> “You signed a contract, you’re under contract,” White said in response to Costa’s comments during an interview with TSN’s Aaron Bronsteter. “If that’s the way you feel, you know what I say all the time, we have fights every weekend. If you want to be busy, you can fight every weekend if you want to. Get out of your contract, and go do whatever you want to do.” </p>
<p> White continued to say he wouldn’t simply release Costa from his current contract which was recently extended, although he did not say how many fights are remaining on his current deal. He would, however, let him compete in the remaining number of fights as quickly as he would like if he believes the grass is greener outside of the UFC. </p>
<p> Costa’s last outing was at UFC 253 in a headlining middleweight title fight against the champ Israel Adesanya. The Brazilian powerhouse lost the fight by TKO in the second round, turning in a performance that baffled White. He has not competed since, despite being booked for fights that have since fallen through. </p>
<p> “You’re in no position to be talking about crazy money after your last performance,” White stated. “You either want to fight, or you don’t want to fight.” </p>
<p> Many fighters have recently spoken out about the paydays that YouTubers are making in the boxing ring against retired fighters versus what they are taking home from the UFC, but White isn’t swayed. “You should be happy for the kid. Good for him,” White said. </p>
<p> “You should have started a YouTube channel when you were 13 years old and built your name up and everything else, and you could’ve had the fight on Saturday night, but you didn’t,” White stated. </p>
<p> Costa released a lengthier statement on Instagram to clarify his current position on the matter: </p>
<p> I have working so hard to come and make a great show for fans next against a great UFC name on similar position as me #2 top ranked but they keep insisting on paying me even less than some unranked fighters , thats so unfair. And im A GUY WHO PEOPLE WANT TO SEE FIGHTING! ⚡️👊 </p>
<p> I believe this is very bad for sport and fan’s lost good fights would suppose happened. I ll be training hard as always to make that vicious fight people love watch </p>
<p> The UFC boss maintains that if fighters want to test the waters and see if there is more money to be made elsewhere, that’s fine with him, as soon as the currently contracted business is completed. </p>
<p> “You’re not a YouTuber, you’re a fighter, and this is what you do for a living – or you don’t, it’s up to you,” White stated. </p>
<p> “Come back and put yourself in a position to do something big.” </p>

<p> American rugby sevens star Ilona Maher delivered a brutal stiff-arm in the United States’ Olympic matchup against Japan on Thursday. </p>
<p> Maher and the U.S. defeated Japan 17-7 in their Pool C game. Maher gave the stiff- arm to her Japanese opponent and finished with the score. She had five points in the U.S. win. </p>
<p> Earlier in the day, the U.S. defeated China, 28-14. Maher didn’t score in that game, but the U.S. was led by Kristi Kirshe, who scored 10 points, and Kayla Canett, who added seven. </p>
<p> Maher had been in the social media spotlight during the Olympics from her TikTok videos. She amassed more than 504,000 followers in the social media app and welcomed new followers with quick biographical information on Wednesday. </p>
<p> "I started playing rugby my senior year of high school. I don’t love my body all the time but I’ve grown to really appreciate it. I get very mad at myself when I make mistakes. I’m self-conscious that my personality may be too much for some people. Tik tok is a way I can escape and not stress about my upcoming games," she said in the video. </p>
<p> Earlier in the week, Maher posted several hilarious videos about her interactions with other athletes in the Olympic Village. </p>
<p> Maher is hoping to lead the U.S. women's rugby team to its first Olympic medal. The team finished in fifth in the competition in 2016. </p>

<p> Usain Bolt’s Net Worth 2022 Compared to Other Sporting Greats Like Roger Federer and Mike Tyson </p>
<p> Published 01/10/2022, 6:30 PM CET </p>
<p> Many incredible stars have graced the turf. Their sensational performances helped them elevate their status as some of the best athletes in the world. Significantly, Usain Bolt, Roger Federer, and Mike Tyson are some of them who stand atop everyone else. These three performed remarkably in their respective fields, cementing their legacy as legends. Thus, their display of talents made them earn more than most of the athletes in the world. </p>
<p> ADVERTISEMENT </p>

<p> With the different net worth comparisons being looked into, it would be a treat to segregate the net worth comparison of these three athletes. So who is the wealthiest amongst the three? </p>

<p> Usain Bolt net worth 2022 </p>
<p> An eight-time Olympic gold medalist, the current world-record holder of the 100 and 200-meters competition, Bolt is the fastest man alive. More than his significant achievements on the track, his bubbling personality is up there with the best. The charisma mixed together with his outstanding running ability makes him a genuine contender for the best athlete the world has ever seen. The fastest man alive made his medals by training hard throughout the years as his net worth stands at $100 million right now. </p>
<p> Back in 2016, he earned $2.5 million by just winning races. Some of the endorsements he signed were of high-end companies that found him to be the perfect image for their brands. Puma paid him £7,750,000 a year while Gatorade added £2-3,000,000 a year that included a bonus every time he got pictured with their drink. Visa, Virgin Media, Digicel, Soul Electronics, and Hublot are some deals signed by Bolt. However, when it comes to net worth, there is a legendary tennis player who comes close to him. </p>
<p> Roger Federer net worth 2022 </p>
<p> Often regarded as the GOAT by several pundits and fans, Federer graced the courts of Wimbledon and other major grand slams for a long time. 40 years old now, he continues to play at a top-level. Along with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, he won 20 grand slams. The single-handed backhand assassin is one of the most graceful players out there as several high-profile companies that took his net worth to an approximate $550 million. That is outrageous. His total ATP career earnings are $129 million. </p>
<p> Likewise, he earned a total of $1 billion from endorsements. That’s staggering. The commitment to this sport is unbelievable. Earning money like that is a testament to his success. Some of his brands include Credit Suisse, Rolex, and Mercedes Benz. It is reported that he earns more money than most of the athletes in the world. When that net worth is compared to Usain Bolt, he stands way ahead of him. It may be hard for Bolt to catch him up. With Federer ranking above him, famous boxer Mike Tyson comes into the picture. </p>

<p> After Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson ruled the boxing world for a long time. Once dubbed ‘the baddest man on the planet’, he knocked his way to get championships. Some of his knockouts and antics were too violent to be showcased on TV while even biting off an opponent’s ear. After all that, he had a net worth of $300 million, wealthier than any other athlete during that time. Although he made the perfect decisions inside his playground, his life outside was filled with drama. </p>
<p> He now has a net worth of just $3 million. Lavish purchases of mansions, cars, jewelry, and other valuables made him bankrupt. The spending levels are so high that he even bought tigers at his home. That’s the level of fun he had during his time at the top. Visiting casinos can be a recreation; but, having one made at his mansion is incredible. Thus, right now, he lives a meager life but goes down as the greatest champion the boxing ring has ever seen. </p>

<p> Bolt gets a significant advantage over Tyson when compared with his net worth. At the end of the day, these three athletes showcased what they were all about in their sport. Wealth is something they acquired throughout their careers. But the incredible talents on display cannot be forgotten. Usain Bolt, Roger Federer, and Mike Tyson are incredible. </p>

<p> “Really Speaks Volume”-Michael Phelps Heaps Praise on Tiger Woods for His GOAT Legacy in Golf </p>
<p> Published 03/10/2022, 5:14 PM CET </p>
<p> There are no words to explain the dominance of Tiger Woods. Although his victories are impressive, it is the way he got to the top, that captures the imagination of every sports fan. Fighting against all the odds, he made comebacks when there was no hope. Hence, the PGA tour released a video of his legacy with many sporting legends talking about the golfer; including, Michael Phelps. </p>
<p> ADVERTISEMENT </p>
<p> Article continues below this ad </p>
<p> Phelps is an ardent follower of golf and holds the record for the longest televised putt in the world. From one champion to another, he added some points to Woods’ illustrious career. Not only him, but many other legends also came up to give their tributes. </p>
<p> ADVERTISEMENT </p>
<p> Article continues below this ad </p>
<p> Michael Phelps explains the struggles of being at the top </p>
<p> Along with Phelps, legendary golfer Jack Nicklaus, Serena Williams, Annika Sorenstam, and Jerry Rice; celebrated his wonderful career and spoke about the golfer’s legendary antics. Phelps, in the meantime, spoke about the player’s will to win and the ability to stay on top. With all the scrutiny he faced in his career, Woods’ love for the sport kept him on top, as seen with his sensational victory at the Augusta Masters in 2019. Thus, Phelps gave his views on what a world-class athlete does when he reached the top. </p>
<p> “The easiest climb in the world is to the top of the mountain. Staying at the top of the mountain is the absolute hardest thing in the world. It really speaks volumes of a person’s drive, a person’s will. He’s got everything,” said Phelps. </p>
<p> As he said, he’s got everything. In his career, he has won 18 majors, recorded 82 PGA tour wins, and created many other records in his life. Thus, his legacy is truly stunning. On the other hand, the tribute by Phelps is similar to his career as he stayed on top for a long time. </p>
<p> Drawing out an incredible legacy for himself </p>

<p> While Woods dominated the golf courses, Phelps dominated the swimming pool. Winning 28 Olympic medals is just a testament to the work he put in his career. Significantly, many countries do not have 23 gold medals in their entire Olympic Games appearances. It is truly special that fans of this generation witnessed the legacy of these two athletes. </p>
<p> A fantastic video, nonetheless, it celebrates the life and legacy of Woods, who dominated the sport. Injuries did not keep him down as he made innumerable returns to provide some of the greatest golfing moments of all time. </p>

<p> Valspar Championship: Latest Odds And Best Bets For Innisbrook </p>
<p> The PGA Tour returns to Innisbrook Golf and Spa Resort this week for the 2022 Valspar Championship. The Valspar is the final stop on the 2022 Florida swing before the tour travels to Texas next week for the first World Golf Championship event of the year. </p>
<p> It is a pretty impressive field that makes its way to Palm Harbor, Florida, for an event that comes just days after the conclusion of the marathon event known as the 2022 Players Championship. The field strength of 411 makes it the third strongest regular PGA tour event of the season so far, just behind the WM Phoenix Open, and Farmers Insurance Open. </p>
<p> Currently, five of the top ten players in the world are set to tee it up this week with Collin Morikawa, Viktor Hovland, Justin Thomas, Xander Schauffele, and Dustin Johnson all making the trip to Innisbrook. </p>
<p> JT and Hovland are currently joint favorites at the top of the oddsmakers boards for the Valspar Championship. Here is a look at the complete top 10 over on WynnBet. </p>
<p> (Odds Courtesy Of WynnBet and are current at the time of publication) </p>
<p> The Best Bets for the 2022 Valspar Championship </p>
<p> PONTE VEDRA BEACH, FLORIDA – MARCH 10: Brooks Koepka of the United States looks on from the third green during the first round of THE PLAYERS Championship on the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass on March 10, 2022 in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. (Photo by Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images) </p>
<p> Brooks Koepka +2800 </p>
<p> This is purely a case of Zigging when everyone is Zagging. Last week Brooks Koepka was a popular pick at the Players Championship and let everyone down with a pretty poor performance, especially during his second round. I’m willing to throw that out this week however as his whole week at TPC Sawgrass was disrupted by the elements. </p>
<p> Koepka may be playing better than it would appear as well, he was decent at the Honda Classic several starts ago when he gained 3.0 strokes with his irons on his way to a 16th place finish. Really his whole game was pretty sharp with the exception of the putter. </p>
<p> The four-time major winner has a pretty good track record on courses’ that compare well with Innisbrook, with high finishes at TPC Southwind, Harbour Town, and TPC River Highlands. </p>
<p> Jason Kokrak +3300 </p>
<p> Kokrak has nice history at the Valspar Championship with five top 15 finishes in his last seven starts at Innisbrook. He has made the cut in each of his last eight starts, this includes last week at TPC Sawgrass in difficult circumstances. </p>
<p> Jason has gained strokes with his irons and the putter in each of his last four starts and really the only thing that has kept him from contending is his off the tee game. Innisbrook will challenge everyone’s driving accuracy this week, however, and I am confident that Kokrak can drive the ball well at the Valspar Championship once again after gaining strokes in that department in five of his last seven starts at Innisbrook. </p>
<p> Alex Noren +5000 </p>
<p> The Swede finished 21st at the Valspar Championship in his first start at Innisbrook last year and he comes into this week having played some really nice golf in 2022 so far. Noren has two top 10’s in his last four starts and he had a solid week last week at the Players Championship as well where he finished 26th. </p>
<p> Alex has gained over six strokes tee to green in each of his last two starts and could be on the verge of picking up his first PGA win. He is definitely worth taking a shot with at +5000 odds this week. </p>
<p> Mito Pereira +12500 </p>
<p> I’ll finish by taking a shot with the talented Chilean at long odds this week. Pereira has a 15th and 30th place finish in two of his last three starts. He missed the cut last week but a glance at the numbers reveals that was solely due to his putter as he lost over four strokes on the greens for a second consecutive start. </p>
<p> Mito has gained strokes tee to green in three straight starts and he has also been solid with his approach numbers. It wasn’t that long ago that he was gaining with the putter so I’ll take a chance that he turns that around this week at the Valspar Championship. </p>

<p> Josh Warrington stops gutsy Kiko Martinez to regain featherweight world title </p>
<p> Josh Warrington regains the IBF featherweight title with a seventh-round stoppage of Kiko Martinez in Leeds. </p>
<p> Josh Warrington has become a two-time world champion with a seventh-round stoppage of IBF featherweight champion Kiko Martinez. </p>
<p> Fighting once again in front of his Leeds supporters, Warrington found himself in a crossroads fight at world level, aware that defeat would leave him down the pecking order with unification fights with other belt holders to be made. </p>
<p> However, spurred on by a cut to Martinez during the first round, Warrington relentlessly hunted down his opponent, concerned that a second bout in succession could be stopped early due to a clash of heads. </p>
<p> Warrington, who also defeated Martinez in May 2017, dropped the Spaniard with a right hand in the first round but Martinez, his face covered in blood, somehow made it through the first three rounds. </p>
<p> While Warrington continued to have frequent success during an enthralling fight, Martinez was still competitive, occasionally reminding the home fighter that he had the power to knock him out like he did Kid Galahad in November. </p>
<p> In the seventh round, however, Warrington closed the show, a sustained onslaught leading to the referee stopping the contest with little complaint from the dethroned champion. </p>

<p> Washington Mock Draft: Commanders Give Carson Wentz New Weapon </p>
<p> In the latest mock draft by Pro Football Focus, Washington adds a new receiver to the mix </p>
<p> Garrett Wilson </p>
<p> Garrett Wilson </p>
<p> Garrett Wilson </p>
<p> Carson Wentz will hopefully be the answer for Washington at quarterback for the next several seasons. For now, it's all about building around the offense for coordinator Scott Turner to elevate Wentz's game. The franchise might as well give its new gunslinger more weapons to work with this season. </p>
<p> In the latest mock draft by Pro Football Focus, Washington misses out on adding the physical receiver Drake London from USC. Instead, the franchise adds one of the top weapons in the class with Ohio State's Garrett Wilson. </p>
<p> The Commanders’ offense needs more firepower beyond Terry McLaurin, Cam Sims, Dyami Brown and Curtis Samuel to have success with Carson Wentz now under center. Wilson is a dynamic pass-catcher who can complement McLaurin immediately as the No. 2 option. His feet are a bit erratic in his routes and releases, but he can clean that up at the next level. </p>
<p> What can’t be coached is his innate separation ability and suddenness with and without the ball in his hands. He is currently DraftKings' favorite (+115) to be the first receiver off the board in the 2022 NFL Draft. - PFF </p>
<p> Washington is hopeful to come to terms with McLaurin on an extension before the start of free agency in 2023. Although the Commanders could look to add the franchise tag him, it's best to try to get a long-term deal done before it even reaches that level. </p>
<p> The Indianapolis Colts traded Carson Wentz to the Washington Commanders and owner Jim Irsay believes this was a "very obvious" move. </p>
<p> Chase Young suffered a torn ACL in Week 10 last season after a lackluster start. Ron Rivera believes this was will impact the edge rusher heading into next year. </p>
<p> After drama following the ending of games a few teams have proposed a change to make overtime more competitive </p>
<p> Samuel was limited last season due to injury. Washington coach Ron Rivera isn't ready to move past Brown, the team's third-round selection in 2021. Both pass-catchers are in for a big season. Adding some competition to the room would make sense. </p>
<p> Wilson, the potential No. 1 receiver in the class, has the tools be a Day 1 contributor. Although he needs to continue to work on his routes, the Buckeyes' receiver rarely drops passes. During his time in Columbus, he finished with seven total dropped catchable balls. </p>
<p> Wilson also has been revered for his ability to make defenders missing open space. In three seasons, he averaged 15.4 yards per catch and recorded at least 30 receptions per season. </p>
<p> Washington could have multiple options on the clock Thursday evening. The Commanders could consider upgrading their linebacker room with either Georgia's Nakobe Dean or Utah's Devin Lloyd. Washington also could add cornerback depth with LSU's Derek Stingley Jr. or Washington's Trent McDuffie. </p>
<p> Receiver is a need for the offense to fully thrive with Wentz at quarterback. Adding Wilson could give Washington to top duo in the division entering 2023 and beyond. </p>

<p> 'What A Joke, That Stinks': Sports World Divided Over Max Verstappen's F1 Championship Win </p>
<p> Take a look at some of the best reactions from the sporting world to Max Verstappen winning the Formula 1 Drivers' Championship and Lewis Hamilton missing out. </p>
<p> In one of the most thrilling endings to a Formula One season, Max Verstappen managed to win the 2021 F1 Drivers' Championship despite being second for most of the final race in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. On Sunday, Lewis Hamilton led the Abu Dhabi GP from the first turn of the race right until the final lap but after a safety car and some 'controversial' race directives from FIA, Max Verstappen managed to overtake his rival and win both the Abu Dhabi GP and the 2021 F1 Drivers' Championship. </p>
<p> Take a look at some of the best reactions from the sporting world to Max Verstappen winning the Formula One Drivers' Championship and Lewis Hamilton missing out. </p>
<p> Sporting world reacts: Sachin Tendulkar and Rohit Sharma to Robert Lewandowski and Virgil Van Dijk </p>
<p> Cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar congratulated Verstappen for his first championship win and also claimed there would be more to come from the youngster. However, he said that his 'heart goes out' to Hamilton, who would have most likely won had it not been for the safety car. </p>
<p> What a race! Congrats to Max for becoming the World Champion for the 1st time & there will be many more. However, my heart goes out to Lewis. What a season he’s had too. If not for the safety car, the trophy would’ve been his. Sheer bad luck. All the best for the next season. pic.twitter.com/pYPLoin4gO </p>
<p> India's new T20I and ODI captain Rohit Sharma used a great cricketing analogy to explain how it all went down in the last lap of the race. </p>
<p> Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski, who missed out on the Ballon d'Or by a small margin of votes, would understand Hamilton's pain but the Polish forward congratulated Verstappen for his 'incredible finish' and 'amazing season'. </p>
<p> Liverpool and Netherlands centre-back Virgil van Dijk called his fellow countryman a 'boss' for his last-lap win. </p>
<p> Former Dutch international Robin van Persie congratulated Max Verstappen for his sensational season and called him a 'true champion'. </p>
<p> Wow 😱🤯 What an incredible ending of a Formule 1 season to remember forever! Two fantastic teams going all in for the win but there can only be one winner. A true champion replaced by another true champion. Congrats to @Max33Verstappen. You made us proud 🟠🦁 pic.twitter.com/5rMOiAh30F </p>
<p> Former England international Gary Lineker was fuming at the way things took a sudden turn in the last five laps. </p>
<p> Six-time MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez congratulated Max Verstappen for his fantastic season and hoped that he wins many more titles. </p>
<p> England cricketer Sam Curran was not at all pleased by the way things turned out in the final lap and called it out for being 'bad'. </p>
<p> Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja called the FIA directives for the last lap 'the biggest mistake in F1 history'. </p>

<p> Sachin Tendulkar Leads Wishes For Shreyas Iyer As Batter Hits 92 Runs On Difficult Pitch </p>
<p> Shreyas Iyer's entertaining knock that came off 98-balls had 10 fours and four sixes, negated all good work done by the visiting bowlers in the first session. </p>
<p> Team India were in a spot of bother during the Pink Ball Test as they fell to 126/5 on a difficult pitch at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. But, Shreyas Iyer again played a splendid innings under pressure to take the score to 252 runs. Iyer scored a counter-attacking 92 runs off 96 balls as he put the pressure back on Sri Lankan bowlers. The next best highest-score of the innings was 39 runs, hit by Rishabh Pant. Iyer's innings put India in position of strength on a track that is offering extensive help to spinners. </p>
<p> IND vs SL: Tendulkar lauds Shreyas Iyer </p>
<p> Iyer's innings was lauded by former cricketers and cricket fans as they hailed the batter for his composure and guile. Sachin Tendulkar led the wishes for the new KKR skipper with Wasim Jaffer posting another hilarious meme to describe Iyer's innings. </p>
<p> Great counterattacking batting from @ShreyasIyer15 on a track that was helping the spinners. His footwork was very good and because of that, he made batting look easy. #INDvSL pic.twitter.com/qI2CBFuWDg </p>
<p> India were struggling at 126 for five at one stage but Rishabh Pant (39 off 26 balls) turned it around with his aggressive yet effective batting. </p>
<p> The left-hander was dropped when he was on four and he made the Lankans pay heavily for the mistake. </p>
<p> Iyer then changed the narrative with his controlled aggression, the result of which was a gritty knock under pressure that will enable India to call the shots in the day/night game. </p>
<p> Iyer made batting look easy after sharp turn and uneven bounce at the M Chinnaswamy track made the Indians dance to Lankan spinners' tunes. </p>
<p> His entertaining knock that came off 98-balls had 10 fours and four sixes, negated all the good work done by the visiting bowlers in the first session when they had taken four wickets, including that of skipper Rohit Sharma (15) and Virat Kohli (23). </p>
<p> He missed out on his second Test hundred as he was stumped off Praveen Jayawickrama (3/81) going for a big shot. </p>
<p> The bowler who had grabbed the momentum for Sri Lanka was left-arm spinner Lasith Embuldeniya (3/94), who also dismissed three batters but was later taken to cleaners by Iyer. </p>
<p> While Iyer and Pant took the counter-attacking route, Hanuma Vihari (31) and Kohli were carefully crafting their knocks during first session. </p>
<p> With the sun shining bright, the pink ball did not swing enough to trouble the batters but a few balls kept really low, making it tough for home team after it elected to bat. </p>
<p> While Mayank Agarwal (4) was run out, Rohit was dismissed by left-arm spinner Lasith Embuldeniya, who got the ball to turn and bounce. </p>
<p> Vihari's eventful stay was ended by Praveen Jayawickrama, also a left-arm spinner, while Virat Kohli's carefully crafted short knock met its end with a ball that kept really low and had him plumb off off-spinner Dhananjaya de Silva. </p>
<p> India could have lost another wicket but Pant was dropped by Suranga Lakmal in the deep when he was on 4. </p>
<p> Vihari and Kohli confidently played drives and cuts to raise a 47-run stand for the third wicket but once it was broken, batting seemed to be a challenge. </p>

<p> This will also include outdoor swimming pools and golf. </p>
<p> A top scientist recently urged the Prime Minister to prioritise outdoor sports as part of his lockdown roadmap. </p>
<p> Edinburgh University’s Professor Woolhouse told the Observer: “This virus very rarely transmits outdoors. So, quite honestly, outdoor activities that don’t involve close physical contact could be adopted now. </p>
<p> “That is not an argument to say we can have crowds back at football matches. But sports involving small numbers of players or sports for children: they could start safely today.” </p>
<p> TENNIS </p>
<p> The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) is in discussions with the government over “the safe resumption of tennis activity as a naturally socially distant sport”. </p>
<p> FOOTBALL </p>
<p> Non-elite football is currently banned in England, which has affected youth and adult grassroots football, NLS feeder leagues etc through the suspension of fixtures and training. </p>
<p> But this will be able to resume at the end of March. </p>
<p> RUGBY </p>
<p> Following the Government’s national lockdown announcement in January 2021, to counter the steep rise in Covid infections, all community rugby activity in England was suspended until further notice. </p>
<p> In line with policy, that meant that all adult and age grade rugby training and fixtures were ordered to stop. </p>
<p> HOCKEY </p>
<p> As hockey isn't a contact sport like rugby, it may be allowed to resume in April. </p>
<p> Grassroots and club hockey is currently suspended, as a result of the latest national lockdown in England. </p>
<p> What are the current rules on outdoor sport? </p>
<p> Elite sports, including rugby and football, are able to continue in line with the government's strict coronavirus hygiene protocols and social distancing measures that are in place to keep players, coaches and staff safe. </p>
<p> Match officials, medics and coaches must remain socially distanced from players where possible during play, for example. </p>
<p> Organised outdoor sport for disabled people is also allowed to continue. </p>
<p> All amateur - grassroots/community - sports are still banned. </p>
<p> What are the rules on outdoor exercise? </p>
<p> Outdoor sports venues were closed when the third lockdown regulations came into force on January 5. </p>
<p> This included tennis courts, golf courses and swimming pools. </p>
<p> People still have access to outdoor exercise, but it can only be on your own/ with people from the same household or just one other person from another household. </p>
<p> Outdoor spaces where you're allowed to exercise include neighbourhood streets, parks, beaches, and the countryside, public gardens and grounds (whether or not you pay to enter them), allotments and outdoor playgrounds. </p>

<p> Super Rugby’s return in limited form, as the New Zealand-based Super Rugby Aotearoa, begins this weekend. </p>
<p> Canadians will be able to watch Super Rugby Aotearoa Back to video </p>
<p> The Land of the Long White Cloud has done such a good job using its geographic isolation, along with an aggressive lockdown approach, that COVID-19 has simply ceased to exist there. </p>
<p> On top of the to-be-expected TV broadcasts, there will be fans in the stadiums when the games kick off between New Zealand’s five Super Rugby teams this weekend. </p>
<p> But whether fans in Canada will be able to watch on their TVs remains unclear. </p>
<p> In normal times, the SANZAAR-run Super Rugby competition is available in Canada through TSN’s online streaming service. The last round played before the whole world went into lockdown, on March 13, was actually aired on TSN’s regular channels. SANZAAR, which was formed in 1996 by the Australia, New Zealand and South Africa rugby boards, is the body which oversees Super Rugby and The Rugby Championship competitions in Rugby Union </p>
<p> Super Rugby Aotearoa is also run by SANZAAR, so it stands to reason that the rights deal that has brought the world’s best club competition to the Great White North should apply. </p>
<p> But sources has confirmed this isn’t exactly clear. It’s not about TSN, rather it’s about ESPN. The American broadcaster holds the Americas-wide rights to Super Rugby and sub-licences to local broadcasters where necessary, like with TSN. ESPN is a minority owner of Canada’s sports leader. </p>
<p> And ESPN is in talks with SANZAAR about the rights for Super Rugby Aotearoa. </p>
<p> TSN PR has not been able to provide a definitive answer to multiple queries on the matter, simply saying they were looking into it. An email to ESPN PR, asking about the rights situation, has not yet drawn a response. </p>
<p> The only answer available at the moment was a quiet response from ESPN’s global rugby Twitter account: </p>
<p> Hi Steve, Our US broadcast team is continuing to work through this and how it might fit into our existing Super Rugby deal. </p>
<p> It’s Tuesday. Super Rugby Aotearoa kicks off Saturday night New Zealand Time (just after midnight Pacific Time on Saturday) with the Highlanders hosting the Chiefs in Dunedin. The Blues then host the Hurricanes on Sunday afternoon , which is prime time in the Pacific Time zone on Saturday. </p>
<p> Surely TSN would love to air some live sports. </p>
<p> Time is running short. </p>

<p> Will Russia Play Under Asian Football Confederation Amid UEFA Ban? What Could Happen Next? </p>
<p> After being barred from all major European events, the Russian Football Union (RFU) may contemplate switching its affiliation from UEFA to the Asian federation. </p>
<p> After being barred from all major European events, the Russian Football Union (RFU) may contemplate switching its affiliation from UEFA to the Asian Football Federation (AFC). This is according to Russian sports journalist Nobel Arustamyan, who speculated on the change of jurisdiction for Russian football teams, both national and club sides, on his Telegram channel. This comes ahead of FIFA's upcoming Congress in Doha, where members are expected to discuss RFU's fate in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. </p>
<p> In his post, Nobel cited the example of the Israel Football Association (IFA), which was expelled as a member of the AFC in 1974 due to pressure from Arab states in the region. Israel was admitted to UEFA in 1992 and since then the domestic teams in the country compete in UEFA club competitions. Nobel suggested that the Russian football union could take a similar path, given that there is no such pressure in Asia on clubs or national teams to refuse to play against Russia because of the war. </p>
<p> "It is possible that in the event of a disqualification, the RFU will move from UEFA to the Asian Confederation after the end of the punishment. A striking example of such a transfer is Israel. The local team competes in UEFA not because of confusion in geography - no, in 1964 Israel hosted and won the Asian Cup. Under the auspices of UEFA, the Israelis came after a boycott by the Arab states - matches between conditional Libya, Jordan or Saudi Arabia became impossible. In Europe, Israel has been playing since the nineties. </p>
<p> Russia expelled from all international tournaments </p>
<p> Russia's national and club teams were barred from all international competitions by FIFA and UEFA "until further notice" after Moscow launched an all-out attack on Ukraine on February 24. FIFA announced its decision to expel Russia from the upcoming 2022 World Cup after countries such as Sweden, Poland, and the Czech Republic refused to play their qualifier games against the nation. </p>
<p> "FIFA and UEFA have today decided together that all Russian teams, whether national representative teams or club teams, shall be suspended from participation in both FIFA and UEFA competitions until further notice," FIFA and UEFA said in a joint statement late last month. </p>

<p> We have spoken to you many times about the fall of governments. The old systems need to be replaced with new ones. The energies that cling to the old are strong indeed. Those that are attached to these energies feel they are losing all power, control and money, if they shift to new and better ways. They seek to lock others into the old ways with fear and anxiety. Most have not experienced this type of energy in this lifetime, but some have. </p>
<p> Have you noticed the intensity is increasing? You may be experiencing physical effects from this increase in energetic flow. We suggest to you that you continue to work on your balancing of energy. Much like standing in a wind storm, you can achieve balance and adjust your position as the winds change. Truly the energy is coming in and in the form of a wave or solar wind gusts. </p>

You can do nothing for those that have chosen the follow the leader path. They will fight you until the bitter end that you are the one heading in the wrong direction. You must show compassion and let it go. We say this to you again and again, listen to your own guidance system. </p>

<p> The goals of yoga are expressed differently in different traditions. In theistic Hinduism, yoga may be seen as a set of practices intended to bring people closer to God - to help them achieve union with God. In Buddhism, which does not postulate a creator-type god, yoga may help people deepen their wisdom, compassion, and insight. In Western nations, where there is a strong emphasis on individualism, yoga practice may be an extension of the search for meaning in self, and integration of the different aspects of being. The terms Self-Realization and god-Realization are used interchangeably in Hindu yoga, with the underlying belief that the true nature of self, revealed through the practice of yoga, is of the same nature as God. Yoga Video (.avi) | Yoga Video (.mov) </p>
<p> Modern yoga practice often includes traditional elements inherent in eastern religion, such as moral and ethical principles, postures designed to keep the body fit, spiritual philosophy, instruction by a guru, chanting of mantras, pranayama, and stilling the mind through meditation.

<p> Zach Johnson will captain the United States when they defend their Ryder Cup crown against Europe in Italy next year, the PGA of America confirmed on Monday. </p>
<p> Johnson, a member of five Ryder Cup teams and vice-captain for the last two editions of the biennial team tournament, was named by PGAA president Jim Richerson. </p>
<p> “I am confident that Zach’s appointment will be wildly popular with the players as well as throughout American golf circles,” Richerson said in a statement. </p>
<p> “He checks every conceivable leadership box and we anticipate that the U.S. Team in Italy will reflect the hard work, grit and selfless determination that have long defined his stellar playing career.” </p>
<p> The next Ryder Cup takes place at the Marco Simone Golf and Country Club in Rome from September 25-October 1 next year. </p>
<p> Johnson, 46, posted a 8-7-2 overall match record in Ryder Cup play and was part of winning teams as a player in 2016 and as a vice captain in last year’s pandemic-delayed edition. </p>
<p> The USA thrashed Europe 19-9 in last year’s Ryder Cup </p>
<p> “To accept this captaincy, to lead this United States Ryder Cup Team abroad after what we accomplished last year at Whistling Straits is simply the greatest honor of my professional career,” said two-time major-winner Johnson. </p>
<p> “To win, we will have to outplay a European team that will have both ample talent and motivation on their side. I am anxious to dig in and begin the process of putting our team in the best possible position to succeed.” </p>
<p> The US hold the cup after thrashing Europe 19-9 last year. </p>

<p> Zimbabwe Sables kicked off the chase for the 2023 Rugby World Cup ticket by pummelling Repechage winners Burkina Faso 101-3 in a match played in Harare on Sunday. </p>
<p> The Rugby Africa Pool D matches were initially scheduled for Tunisia but had to be moved to Harare due to the rising COVID-19 cases in Tunisia. </p>
<p> Tunisia were also forced to withdraw from the tournament that serves as a qualification pathway for the 2023 Rugby World Cup due to travel restriction. </p>
<p> With Zimbabwe playing in their own backyard, they put up a nearly perfect performance which saw them score 15 tries against the newbies. By the halftime break, Zimbabwe were leading 47-3 having scored seven tries and converted six. </p>
<p> In the second half, they got eight more tries for 54 points to pick the huge win over Burkina Faso. </p>
<p> Three players, Shingirai Katsvere, Matthew McNab and Cleopas Kundiona landed a brace of tries in the win. Nine more players, Biselele Tshamala, Keith Chiwara, Sebastian Roche, Marcus Nel, Deanne Makoni, Martin Mangongo, Shayne Makombe, Aiden Burnett and Matthew Mandioma got a try each. </p>
